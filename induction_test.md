# 1. All you as an incoming Intern on probation need to know: 
CEVOpen is an online platform for remote internships during the Pandemic, conducted at the interface of NIPGR, India and the University of Cambridge, U.K. 

We would like you to go through our main GitHub repository to familiarize yourself with the workflow, software, project, and so on. The [Wiki Home page](https://github.com/petermr/CEVOpen/wiki) is a good place to start. We are an open-source community. Please make sure to read the [Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/) and adhere to it. It basically says, "be respectable and helpful towards everyone".

For the first week or two, you will be assigned certain tasks which you should try completing independently. You should also document your steps as you go. This isn’t an exam.

## 1.3. What you should record while performing tasks
Recording what you perform is crucial to the project. Proper documentation helps reproduce the same task, debug errors and so on.
 
Here is a Wiki section on [how to report errors](https://github.com/petermr/CEVOpen/wiki#23-reporting-errors). Though it talks about error reporting, a lot of those principles are true for documentation as well. 

In short, when you are running our tools, make sure to note down:
- What commands you ran
- What you expected it to do 
- Results you get
- Errors, if any
Comments and feedback on how to improve our existing documentation would be useful. Avoid screenshots and always format your code in the code block using backticks.
