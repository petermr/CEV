        <span class="abst" title="Tagetes lucida Cav. (Asteraceae) is an ancient medicinal plant commonly used to alleviate pain. Nevertheless, scientific studies validating this property are lacking in the literature. Animal models of pain were used to evaluate the antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities of T. lucida essential oil (TLEO) and a bioactive metabolite. The chemical constitution and possible toxicity of the extract and the mechanism of action of β-caryophyllene were also explored. Temporal course curves and dose-response graphics were generated using TLEO (0.1-10 mg/kg or 3.16-31.62 mg/kg) and β-caryophyllene (3.16-10 mg/kg). Metamizole (80 mg/kg) and indomethacin (20 mg/kg) were used as reference drugs in the formalin assay and writhing test in rats and mice, respectively. The β-caryophyllene mechanism of action was explored in the presence of naloxone (1 mg/kg), flumazenil (10 mg/kg), WAY100635 (0.16 mg/kg), or nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (20 mg/kg) in the formalin test in rats. GC/MS analysis demonstrated the presence of geranyl acetate (49.89%), geraniol (7.92%), and β-caryophyllene (6.27%). Significant and dose-dependent antinociceptive response was produced by TLEO and β-caryophyllene without the presence of gastric damage. In conclusion, β-caryophyllene was confirmed as a bioactive compound in the T. lucida analgesic properties by involving the participation of receptors like opioids, benzodiazepines, and Serotonin 1A receptor (5-HT1A), as well as nitric oxide.">

To investigate the effect of cultivation season and standard chemical and nano fertilizers (n) on the yield components and antioxidant properties of Dragon's head, a factorial experiment based on randomized complete block design was conducted with 12 treatments and three replications. Experimental treatments consisted of two seasons (spring and winter cultivation) and six levels of fertilizer (control, NPK-s, NPK-n, Fe-chelated-n, NPK-n + Fe-chelated-n, NPK-s + NPK-n + Fe-chelated-n). The traits included grain yield per plant, essential oil percentage and yield, mucilage percentage and yield, antioxidant properties in the seeds and leaves, including total phenols and flavonoids content, DPPH radical scavenging, and nitric oxide and superoxide radical scavenging. The results showed that winter cultivation had a noticeable advantage over spring cultivation across all of the traits. The highest grain yield per plant was obtained in winter cultivation using NPK-n + Fe-chelated-n fertilizer treatment. The highest essential oil percentage was in NPK-n + Fe-chelated-n. The highest mucilage percentage was observed in NPK-s + NPK-n + Fe-chelated-n fertilizer treatment, which was not statistically different to NPK-n + Fe-chelated-n treatment. The combined effects of winter cultivation and NPK-n + Fe-chelated-n fertilizers resulted in improving antioxidant activity traits. Overall, the results indicated that the combination of winter cultivation and NPK-n + Fe-chelated-n fertilizers are the most appropriate treatment to acquire highest qualitative and quantitative yield of Dragon's head, in the Azerbaijan region (Iran).">

Due to the growing market demand, long cultivation period, and consumption of pine trunk during cultivation, alternative methods for producing &lt;i&gt;P. cocos&lt;/i&gt; or its active components should be investigated. In this study, WPS, triterpenoids, monosaccharide composition, and essential oil in fermented mycelia and cultivated sclerotium were analyzed using UV spectrophotometry, HPLC, pre-column derivatization, and HS-GC/MS, respectively. Our results showed that the WPS and triterpenoids in mycelia are several times higher than those in sclerotium. Among the 62 compounds identified by HS-GC/MS analysis from the essential oil obtained from the fermentation media and a fresh external layer, the two main fragrances in common were linalool and methyl phenylacetate. Our results suggested that it is applicable to produce polysaccharides and triterpenoids by the fermentation of &lt;i&gt;P. cocos&lt;/i&gt;, and a strategy to improve triterpenoid production in the fermentation process was proposed.">

In this study, we assessed comparative antibacterial and antifungal effects of extracts from four Indigenous plants (Nerium sp; Mentha sp; Aloe vera and Eucalyptus sp). Total phenolic and flavonoid content were extracted by microwave-assisted extractor and used for phytochemical assay. Antimicrobial experiment was done by micro dilution technique. A post hoc analysis inbuilt with one-way ANOVA test was used for the compilation of antibiotic sensitivity data and percent inhibition. Total phenolic content was significantly high in Mentha sp. and low in Nerium sp. (All p &lt; 0.05). In antibacterial and antifungal activity higher concentrations of extracts showed a strong activity, which was as good as antibiotics used as control. Results from Eucalyptus sample showed a significant growth reducing capability even at lower concentrations. This study concludes that the plant extracts can be used to treat microbial infections with almost same efficacy as antibiotics and with a lower chance of resistance development.">

In order to assess the AMF effects on different aromatic species, an open-field experiment was carried out using Artemisia dracunculus (tarragon), Lavandula angustifolia (lavender) and Hyssopus officinalis (hyssop). AMF stimulated the growth of tarragon and lavender plants, whereas hyssop showed a slight developmental slowing; nonetheless, a significant increase in essential oil content in the three species was seen. AMF application increased the biomass of A. dracunculus and H. officinalis by 20-35%. No differences in antioxidant activity and phenolics content were recorded at harvest between the control and AMF-inoculated plants, but the latter showed a significant increase in antioxidant status upon storage at high temperature and humidity compared to the untreated control. The enhancement of abiotic stress resistance during storage in plants inoculated with AMF was the highest in A. dracunculus, and the lowest in H. officinalis, while the untreated control plants showed a significant decrease in phenolics, ascorbic acid and chlorophyll content, as well as antioxidant activity, upon the abiotic stress. AMF inoculation differentially affected the mineral composition, increasing the accumulation of Se, I and Zn in A. dracunculus, and decreasing the levels of heavy metals and Co, Fe, Li, Mn in H. officinalis. Based on the outcome of the present research, AMF inoculation resulted in a significant enhancement of the overall performances of A. dracunculus, L. angustifolia and H. officinalis, and also in the improvement of plant antioxidant status upon storage in stress conditions.">

The essential oil of T. ammi fruits was extracted by hydrodistillation, and the amount of thymol was calculated by a gas-chromatography method. Spermatogonial stem cells were isolated from the testes of mice using enzyme digestion. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was applied to assess the gene expressions of promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (Plzf), DNA-binding protein inhibitor (ID-4), tyrosine-protein kinase (c-Kit), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) and Bcl2-associated X protein (BAX). The number and diameter of colonies were also measured in the treated cells. The amount of thymol in the oil was 130.7 ± 7.6 µg/mL. Flow cytometry analysis showed that 92.8% of all cells expressed stimulated by retinoic acid 8 (Stra8), a spermatogonial stem cell marker. Expression of Plzf and ID-4 genes significantly increased in the treatment groups, while c-Kit and BAX decreased, and Bcl2 increased in the presence of essential oil. The numbers and diameters of cells were also improved by the application of the plant oil. These data indicated that monoterpenes from the oil of T. ammi improved the quality and viability of spermatogonia cells in the cell culture.">

Water stress was applied using a reduced irrigation strategy based on re-watering at 80%, 60% and 40% of the field capacity (FC). Increasing water stress, while significantly enhancing malondialdehyde (MDA), H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, electrolyte leakage, oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and total glutathione (GT), reduced glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities, which led to a marked reduction in fluorescence (Fv/Fm). Foliar application of melatonin alleviated the oxidative stress by increasing GT, CAT, POD, SOD and GR activities and reducing GSSG. In particular, melatonin heightened GSH content as well as the ratio of GSH/GSSG when compared to non-sprayed water stressed plants. Melatonin-treated plants had significantly lower SOD and POD activities than control plants under drought stress, while the CAT activity was enhanced with the foliar treatment. Essential oil yield of both Salvia species increased with the decrease in irrigation from 80% to 60% FC but diminished with the more severe water deficit (40% FC). Essential oil components of Salvia nemorosa were β- caryophyllene, germacrene- B, spathulenol, and cis- β- farnesene, while (E) - β- ocimene, α- gurjnnene, germacrene-D, hexyl acetate and aromadendrene was the major constituents of Salvia reuterana. When plants were subjected to water deficit, melatonin treatment increased the concentration and composition of the essential oil. In particular, melatonin treatments improved the primary oil components in both species when compared to non-melatonin treated plants. In conclusion, reduced irrigation regimes as well as melatonin treatments resulted in a significant improvement of essential oil production and composition in both Salvia species.">

Methods:In this research, the antimicrobial activities of chloroformic and methanolic extracts of Sophora flavescens, Rhaponticum repens, Alhagi maurorum, Melia azedarach, Peganum harmala, and Juncus conglomeratus were evaluated against 8 bacteria (S. aureus, B. subtilis, R. toxicus, P. aeruginosa, E. coli, P. syringae, X. campestris, P. viridiflava) and 3 fungi (Pyricularia oryzae, Fusarium oxysporum and Botrytis cinerea), through disc diffusion method. Furthermore, the essential oils of plants with the highest antibacterial activity were analyzed utilizing GC/MS. Moreover, the tested plants were exposed to screening for possible antioxidant effect utilizing DPPH test, guaiacol peroxidas, and catalase enzymes. Besides, the amount of total phenol and flavonoid of these plants was measured. Results:Among the tested plants, methanolic and chloroformic extracts of P. harmala fruits showed the highest antibacterial activity against the tested bacteria. Besides, the investigation of free radical scavenging effects of the tested plants indicated the highest DPPH, protein, guaiacol peroxidase, and catalase in P. harmala, M. azedarach, J. conglomeratus fruits, and J. conglomeratus fruits, respectively. In addition, the phytochemical analysis demonstrated the greatest amounts of total phenolic and flavonoid compositions in J. conglomeratus and P. harmala, respectively. Conclusion:The results indicated that these plants could act as a promising antimicrobial agent, due to their short killing time.">

        <span class="abst" title="This study examines the chemical constituents, antioxidant potential, antibacterial mechanism, and antiproliferative activity of Cinnamomum zeylanicum bark essential oil. The compositions of the oil were analyzed by GC-MS, and the major constituents were found to be (E)-cinnamaldehyde (71.50%), linalool (7.00%), β-caryophyllene (6.40%), eucalyptol (5.40%), and eugenol (4.60%). C. zeylanicum essential oil contained remarkable levels of phenolic and bioactive compounds with outstanding ability to scavenge free radicals and inhibit β-carotene oxidation. The growth of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria, especially Gram-positive ones (i.e. Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus), was highly inhibited by the oil, compared to the Gram-negative pairs (i.e. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhi). The cells of L. innocua and E. coli (as the most sensitive and resistant strains to the oil, respectively) treated with C. zeylanicum essential oil were observed by scanning electron microscopy to unravel structural changes. It was observed that the essential oil quickly exerted its antibacterial activity through disrupting cell envelope and facilitating the leakage of intracellular compounds. The essential oil had also a dose-dependent antiproliferative effect on adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AT-MSCs), and the cell proliferation could be induced by low concentrations of the oil. The present study indicated that C. zeylanicum essential oil with remarkable antioxidant and antimicrobial properties could be applied to develop novel natural preservatives for food and medicinal purposes.">

Essential oils extraction was performed using hydrodistillation and the separation of the constituents was carried out by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Antifungal activities were tested against &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus terreus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Microsporum canis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Microsporum gypseum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Trichophyton mentagrophytes,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt;.

However, they do not form a well-classified group of substances. This Special Issue consists of five reviews focusing on clinical bacteria applications in food and their specific effects upon virulent bacterial factors. You will also find a research on much needed, new antimicrobials sourced in extreme environments, and secondary metabolites of Burkholderia. This issue includes 12 original research papers which will provide you with an in-depth coverage of the protein extract activity, as well as the activity of other plant extracts, on fighting bacteria, fungi or diarrhea. Their use in broilers or laying eggs for production purposes has also been focused on in order to improve gut microbiota. Last but not least, we should not forget about honey and its effect; Allium sativum-fermented extracts, as well as other &quot;natural&quot; compounds, have been studied in their fight against biofilms. Furthermore, we have also examined the use of essential oils, which are currently used in edibles such as fresh sausages.

Thymol prevailed in WEO (26.69%), while carvacrol prevailed in SEO (14.30%). Antimicrobial activity was tested by agar-well diffusion method, and MIC/MLC values were determined by broth dilution method. Values of MIC/MLC were 0.125/0.25 μg/ml for SEO against S. aureus, P. mirabilis and K. pneumonia and for WEO against B. subtilus. It was observed that plants growing at lower altitude in Wasita locality had better antifungal activity, while those growing at higher altitude at Safsaf locality had better antibacterial activity. Both essential oils had a better anthelmintic activity than the standard piperazine citrate against a tested earthworm. However, SEO oil had a significantly higher anthelmintic activity than WEO. Cytotoxicity of the oils tested using SRB assay on human breast cancer (MCF-7) and colon cancer cell lines (HCT-116) showed better activity for SEO, especially against HCT-116 with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 2.45 ± 0.21 μg/ml.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Thus, altitude is an important factor that should be considered as it affected the yield, composition and biology of the plant extracts.">

        <span class="abst" title="Cardiovascular diseases are one of the most prevalent diseases worldwide, and its rate of mortality is rising annually. In accordance with the current condition, studies on medicinal plants upon their activity on cardiovascular diseases are often being encouraged to be used in cardiovascular disease management, due to the availability of medicinal values in certain dedicated plants. This review was conducted based on two plant families, which are Asteraceae and Lamiaceae, to study on their action in cardiovascular disease relieving activities, to review the relationship between the phytochemistry of Asteraceae and Lamiaceae families and their effect on cardiovascular diseases, and to study their toxicology. The medicinal plants from these plant family groups are collected based on their effects on the mechanisms that affect the cardiovascular-related disease which are an antioxidant activity, anti-hyperlipidemic or hypocholesterolemia, vasorelaxant effect, antithrombotic action, and diuresis effect. In reference to various studies, the journals that conducted &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments, which were used to prove the specific mechanisms, are included in this review. This is to ensure that the scientific value and the phytochemicals of the involved plants can be seen based on their activity. As a result, various plant species from both Asteraceae and Lamiaceae plant family have been identified and collected based on their study that has proven their effectiveness and uses in cardiovascular diseases. Most of the plants have an antioxidant effect, followed by anti-hyperlipidemia, vasorelaxant, antithrombotic, and diuretic effect from the most available to least available studies, respectively. These are the mechanisms that contribute to various cardiovascular diseases, such as heart attack, stroke, coronary heart disease, and hypertension. Further studies can be conducted on these plant species by identifying their ability and capability to be developed into a new drug or to be used as a medicinal plant in treating various cardiovascular diseases.">

        <span class="abst" title="One of the major factors limiting the production of medicinal plants in arid and semi-arid areas is water deficit or drought stress. One-third of the land in the world is arid and semi-arid and is inhabited by nearly 4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; people. &lt;i&gt;Ocimum basilicum&lt;/i&gt; (sweet basil) is a valuable medicinal plant that is sensitive to water deficit, and water shortage negatively affects sweet basil yield and quality. Water availability in the root zone of basil could ameliorate the negative effects of water shortage. To the best of our knowledge, although the effects of hydrophilic polymers (HPs) have been studied in different agricultural crops, the effects of HP application in medicinal plants have not been previously investigated. This investigation was conducted to explore the effects on water use efficiency when using Stockosorb&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; (STS) and psyllium seed mucilage (PSM) as hydrophilic polymers (HPs) and the effects of these HPs on essential oil quality, quantity, and yield. The research was set up in a factorial experiment on the basis of completely randomized block design with three replications. We used two HPs, STS (industrial) and PSM (herbal), with two methods of application (mixed with soil, mixed with soil + root) at four concentrations (0%, 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3% (&lt;i&gt;w&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;w&lt;/i&gt;)). Results showed that the STS and PSM significantly increased the dry herb yield (both shoot and root) in comparison to the control, and the improving effect was higher when these HPs were mixed with soil + root. The highest dry herb yield (6.74 and 3.68 g/plant for shoot and root, respectively) was detected in the PSM at 0.1% mixed with soil + root. There was not any significant difference in dry herb yield among PSM (0.1%), PSM (0.2%), and STS (0.2%) when mixed with soil + root. Soil application of PSM and soil + root application of STS at a concentration of 0.3% increased the Essential Oil (EO) content almost three-fold in comparison to the control (0.5% and 0.52% to 0.18% &lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;w&lt;/i&gt;, respectively). The maximum essential oil yield was recorded in plants treated with STS (0.2% in) or PSM (0.1%) by soil + root application (0.21 and 0.19 mL/plant, respectively). PSM at concentrations of 0.1% and 0.2% (mixed with soil + root) showed the highest water use efficiency (1.91 and 1.82 g dry weight (DW)/L H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, respectively). STS mixed with soil also significantly improved water use efficiency (WUE) in comparison to the control. The application of these HPs improved the quality of sweet basil essential oil by increasing the linalool and decreasing the eugenol, epi-α-cadinol, and trans-α-bergamotene content.">

This study aims to explore the chemical properties of leaf essential oil (EO) from Ocimum viride and to evaluate its antimicrobial and anticancer potential. Main methods:Characterization of essential oil was done by GCMS, antimicrobial by agar well diffusion methods, in vitro cytotoxicity evaluation by MTT assay, cell death analysis was done by DNA fragmentation, cell cycle analysis, nuclear morphology analysis and molecular docking studies were also conducted. Key findings:Essential oil from aerial parts (leaf) of Ocimum viride revealed high content of oxygenated monoterpenes, notably thymol (~50%) and γ-terpinene (~18%). Further, antibacterial analysis showed that among all the evaluated bacterial species EO showed highest sensitivity against the Bacillus subtilis and was also found most effective against HT-29 colon cancer cell line with IC50 value of ~0.034 ± 0.001μL/mL. Mechanistic studies revealed that EO inhibits the growth of HT-29 colon cancer cells probably through induction of irreparable DNA damage leading to subsequent cell death in apoptotic manner. Molecular docking analysis also supports the in vitro studies conducted by indicating the interaction of thymol with Sec A protein of Bacillus subtilis cell wall as well as with Beclin protein responsible for apoptotic corpse clearance. Significance:Taken together, our results indicate that EO possesses potent antimicrobial and anticancer properties, and may find applications as effective antibacterial and in cancer therapeutics.">

        <span class="abst" title="Metabolic diseases like diabetes mellitus or dyslipidemia have a complex etiology characterized by the interference of genetic predisposition and environmental factors like diet or lifestyle. Over time they can cause significant vascular complications, leading to dysfunction or failure of key organs (brain, heart), with possible fatal consequences or a severe reduction of life quality. Although current authorized drugs may successfully control blood glucose or cholesterol level, their use is often associated with severe side effects, therefore the development of new drug candidates is necessary for a better management of metabolic diseases. Among potential new drug sources, aromatic plants rich in essential oils like &lt;i&gt;Melissa officinalis&lt;/i&gt; L., &lt;i&gt;Mentha x piperita&lt;/i&gt; L., &lt;i&gt;Cuminum cyminum&lt;/i&gt; L. or &lt;i&gt;Pistacia lentiscus&lt;/i&gt; L. var. &lt;i&gt;chia&lt;/i&gt; are very promising due to their diverse chemical composition and multiple mechanisms of action. This review describes a series of recent experimental studies investigating antidiabetic and hypolipemic effects of essential oils extracted from several aromatic plant species with an ethnopharmacological relevance in the Balkan peninsula. The pharmacological models used in the studies together with the putative mechanisms of action of the main constituents are also detailed. The presented data clearly sustain a potential administration of the studied essential oils for the prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases. Further research is needed in order to ascertain the therapeutic importance of these findings.">

Due to the side effects and resistance of pathogenic microorganisms to antibiotics and most drugs on the market, a great deal of attention has been paid to extracts and biologically active compounds isolated from plant species used in herbal medicine. &lt;i&gt;Artemisia absinthium&lt;/i&gt; is an important perennial shrubby plant that has been widely used for the treatment of several ailments. Traditionally, &lt;i&gt;A. absinthium&lt;/i&gt; has always been of pharmaceutical and botanical importance and used to manage several disorders including hepatocyte enlargement, hepatitis, gastritis, jaundice, wound healing, splenomegaly, dyspepsia, indigestion, flatulence, gastric pain, anemia, and anorexia. It has also been documented to possess antioxidant, antifungal, antimicrobial, anthelmintic, anti-ulcer, anticarcinogenic, hepatoprotective, neuroprotective, antidepressant, analgesic, immunomodulatory, and cytotoxic activity. Long-term use of A. absinthium essential oil may cause toxic and mental disorders in humans with clinical manifestations including convulsions, sleeplessness, and hallucinations. Combination chemotherapies of artemisia extract or its isolated active constituents with the currently available antibabesial or anti-malarial drugs are now documented to relieve malaria and piroplasmosis infections. The current review examines the phytoconstituents, toxic and biological activities of &lt;i&gt;A. absinthium.&lt;/i&gt;">

According to numerous studies, &lt;i&gt;M. vulgare&lt;/i&gt; acts as a good antioxidant agent, and due to this, it could potentially be useful in treatments of cancer, diabetes mellitus, and liver diseases. In addition, its anti-inflammatory, wound-healing, antihypertensive, hypolipidemic, and sedative potential are discussed. Apart from that, its antimicrobial activity, especially against Gram+ bacteria, fungi, herpes simplex virus, and parasites such as &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Trichomonas vaginalis&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium berghei-berghei&lt;/i&gt; was recorded. Additionally, it could be used as a chicken lice repellent, herbicide, and natural insecticide against mosquito larvae and natural molluscicide. In veterinary medicine, &lt;i&gt;M. vulgare&lt;/i&gt; can be used as an anthelmintic against the eggs and larvae of bovine strongyles parasites, and as an antibiotic against bovine mastitis caused by resistant bacterial strains. Due to the mentioned benefits, there is a tendency for the cultivation of &lt;i&gt;M. vulgare&lt;/i&gt; in order to ensure high-quality raw material, but more firm scientific evidence and well-designed clinical trials are necessary for the well-established use of &lt;i&gt;M. vulgare&lt;/i&gt; herb and its preparations.">

        <span class="abst" title="As viral infections are an increasing threat to human societies, the need for new therapeutic strategies is becoming even more obvious. As no vaccine is available for COVID-19, the development of directly acting antiviral agents and preventive strategies have to be considered. Nature provides a huge reservoir of anti-infectious compounds, from which we can deduce innovative ideas, therapies, and products. Anti-adhesive natural products interact with the receptor-mediated recognition and early interaction of viruses with the host cells, leading to a reduced internalisation of the virus and reduced infections (e.g., procyanidin-B-2-di-O-gallate against influenza and herpes virus). Lignans like podophyllotoxin and bicyclol show strong antiviral activities against different viruses, and essential oils can directly interact with viral membranes and reduce the host's inflammatory responses (e.g., 1,8-cineol). &lt;i&gt;Echinacea&lt;/i&gt; extracts stimulate the immune system, and bioavailable alkamides are key players by interacting with immunomodulating cannabinoid receptors. COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 infections have, in part, successfully been treated in China by preparations from traditional Chinese medicine and, while it is too early to draw conclusions, some promising data are available. There is huge potential, but intensified research is needed to develop evidence-based medicines with a clearly defined chemical profile. Intensified research and development, and therefore funding, are needed for exploiting nature's reservoir against viral infections. Combined action for basic research, chemistry, pharmacognosy, virology, and clinical studies, but also supply chain, sustainable sourcing, and economic aspects have to be considered. This review calls for intensified innovative science on natural products for the patients and for a healthier world!">

It contains a large number of active compounds of potential therapeutic activity, but also toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Science-based information is needed to support the developing modern use of this plant, and to direct continued safe practice in traditional medicine. The present study focused on the essential oils from leaves and rhizomes of the understudied P. hybridus ssp. ochroleucus from the Balkans, and evaluated its phytochemistry and potential therapeutic activities (antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-cholinesterase and anti-inflammatory), as well its toxicology potential (acute toxicity in insects and mice). We studied the essential oils, which are not commonly used in traditional practices, but have a potential for safe use since the toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which are non-volatiles, are usually not present in the distilled essential oils. Pyrrolizidine alkaloids were indeed not detected in the essential oils; ingestion of the essential oils did not induce toxicity signs in mice, and topical application did not elicit skin irritation in humans. The essential oils had no antimicrobial properties against 20 pathogenic bacterial strains, but demonstrated good local anti-inflammatory activity in a Carrageenan-induced paw edema test. An insect toxicity test demonstrated that the leaf essential oil is an efficient insect repellent, and the demonstrated anti-cholinesterase activity suggests a potential for the treatment of neurological conditions. Isopetasin, a sesquiterpene found in plants of the genus Petasites, known to have anti-inflammatory effects, was present only in the rhizomes essential oil (3.9%), and sesquiterpene lactones concentrations were high, likely contributing to the antioxidant activity.">

The major compound of the essential oils was germacrene D, followed by bicyclogermacrene, β-elemene and germacrene A. The phytotoxicity assay showed that the essential oils of both species reduced the root and shoot growth in L. sativa and decreased the germination and shoot growth in S. bicolor. Inhibition was dependent on the tested oil concentration. In the cytotoxicity assay, a decrease in mitotic index and chromosomal and nuclear alterations were observed, which resulted from aneugenic and clastogenic action.">

Flow cytometry was used to investigate the potential mechanisms of their antibacterial activity and confirmed that the tested EOs act by permeabilizing the bacterial membrane and by inhibiting the activity of the efflux pumps. The immunomodulatory effect of the three EOs was determined by analyzing the gene expression profiles for pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines of the THP-1 cells. The summer savory EO induced a clear proinflammatory effect, while the others did not significantly influence the cytokines profile of the tested cells. Taken together, our results indicate that summer savory EO and, to a lesser extent, sage and dill EOs could be used to inhibit bacteria involved in oral plaque formation and to reduce the expression of genes known to contribute to the inflammatory response using cell culture assessment.">

Therefore, there is an urgent need to discover new classes of potent antimicrobial agents with novel modes of action. &lt;i&gt;Cannabis sativa&lt;/i&gt; is an herbaceous plant that has been used for millennia for medicinal and recreational purposes. Its bioactivity is largely due to a class of compounds known as cannabinoids. Recently, these natural products and their analogs have been screened for their antimicrobial properties, in the quest to discover new anti-infective agents. This paper seeks to review the research to date on cannabinoids in this context, including an analysis of structure-activity relationships. It is hoped that it will stimulate further interest in this important issue.">

Essential oils represent a green environmentally-friendly alternative to synthetic pesticides for controlling stored-product insect pests. &lt;i&gt;Launaea taraxacifolia&lt;/i&gt; is a leafy vegetable plant found in several parts of Nigeria. The leaves are eaten either fresh as a salad or cooked as a sauce. The essential oil obtained from fresh leaves of &lt;i&gt;L. taraxacifolia&lt;/i&gt; was obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Twenty-nine compounds were identified, accounting for 100% of the oil composition. The major component classes were monoterpene hydrocarbons (78.1%), followed by oxygenated monoterpenoids (16.2%), sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (2.1%), oxygenated sesquiterpenoids (0.3%), and non-terpenoid derivatives (3.3%). The leaf essential oil was dominated by monoterpene hydrocarbons including limonene (48.8%), sabinene (18.8%), and (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-β-ocimene (4.6%), along with the monoterpenoid aldehyde citronellal (11.0%). The contact insecticidal activity of &lt;i&gt;L. taraxacifolia&lt;/i&gt; essential oil against &lt;i&gt;Sitophilus oryzae&lt;/i&gt; was carried out; median lethal concentration (LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) values of topical exposure of &lt;i&gt;L. taraxacifolia&lt;/i&gt; essential oil were assessed over a 120-h period. The LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values ranged from 54.38 μL/mL (24 h) to 10.10 µL/mL (120 h). The insecticidal activity of the &lt;i&gt;L. taraxacifolia&lt;/i&gt; essential oil can be attributed to major components limonene (48.8%), sabinene (18.8%), and citronellal (11.0%), as well as potential synergistic action of the essential oil components. This result showed &lt;i&gt;L. taraxacifolia&lt;/i&gt; essential oil may be considered as a useful alternative to synthetic insecticides.">

An inhibition assay was performed &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; using &lt;i&gt;Eimeria tenella&lt;/i&gt; Wisconsin strain sporozoites and Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells. Intracellular sporozoite invasion was quantified by detection of &lt;i&gt;E. tenella&lt;/i&gt; DNA using qPCR from cell monolayers harvested at 2 and 24 h post-infection. Parasite invasion was inhibited by the oregano essential oil at the concentration of 100 μg/ml by 83 or 93% after 2 or 24 h, respectively. Garlic essential oil reached a maximum inhibition of 70% after 24 h with the 50 μg/ml concentration. Normal morphology was observed in MDBK cells exposed to concentrations of 100 μl/ml of garlic or oregano for over 24 h. In the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; trial, 180 male broiler chicks (45.3 ± 0.7 g) were allocated into two treatments (6 pens of 15 chicks per treatment). Control treatment was fed commercial diets without antibiotics or anticoccidials. The ORE-GAR treatment was fed the same control diets, further supplemented with a premix (1 g/kg feed) containing the oregano (50 g/kg premix) and garlic (5 g/kg premix) essential oils. At day 37, all birds were slaughtered under commercial conditions, and intestinal samples were collected. ORE-GAR treatment had improved final body weight (1833.9 vs. 1.685.9 g; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.01), improved feed conversion ratio (1.489 vs. 1.569; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.01), and reduced fecal oocyst excretion (day 28: 3.672 vs. 3.989 log oocysts/g, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.01; day 37: 3.475 vs. 4.007 log oocysts/g, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.001). In the caecal digesta, ORE-GAR treatment had lower total anaerobe counts (8.216 vs. 8.824 CFU/g; p &lt; 0.01), whereas in the jejunum digesta the ORE-GAR treatment had higher counts of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; (5.030 vs. 3.530 CFU/g; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.01) and &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt; (5.341 vs. 3.829 CFU/g; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.01), and lower counts of &lt;i&gt;Clostridium perfringens&lt;/i&gt; (2.555 vs. 2.882 CFU/g; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.01). In conclusion, the combined supplementation of oregano and garlic essential oils had a potent anticoccidial effect &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and a growth-promoting effect in broilers reared in the absence of anticoccidial drugs.">

        <span class="abst" title="The quality of health care in Mesoamerica is influenced by its rich cultural diversity and characterized by social inequalities. Especially indigenous and rural communities confront diverse barriers to accessing formal health services, leading to often conflicting plurimedical systems. Fostering integrative medicine is a fundamental pillar for achieving universal health coverage (UHC) for marginalized populations. Recent developments toward health sovereignty in the region are concerned with assessing the role of traditional medicines, and particularly herbal medicines, to foster accessible and culturally pertinent healthcare provision models. In Mesoamerica, as in most regions of the world, a wealth of information on traditional and complementary medicine has been recorded. Yet these data are often scattered, making it difficult for policy makers to regulate and integrate traditionally used botanical products into primary health care. This critical review is based on a quantitative analysis of 28 survey papers focusing on the traditional use of botanical drugs in Mesoamerica used for the compilation of the &quot;Mesoamerican Medicinal Plant Database&quot; (MAMPDB), which includes a total of 12,537 use-records for 2188 plant taxa. Our approach presents a fundamental step toward UHC by presenting a pharmacological and toxicological review of the cross-culturally salient plant taxa and associated botanical drugs used in traditional medicine in Mesoamerica. Especially for native herbal drugs, data about safety and effectiveness are limited. Commonly used cross-culturally salient botanical drugs, which are considered safe but for which data on effectiveness is lacking constitute ideal candidates for treatment outcome studies.">

Paying attention to plant nutrition requirement is so important. In order to assess the effect of nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) dosage supplies from two types of fertilizers on growth and phytochemical properties of Echinacea purpurea rhizomata cum radicibus, an experiment with completely simple design was carried out under greenhouse conditions. Two types of fertilizers (new invented nitrogen (N) slow release fertilizer and urea chemical fertilizer) at three dosages (50, 100, and 150 mM) were applied. Plant growth parameters and total phenolic (TPC), total flavonoids (TFC), polysaccarides content, essential oil content, caffeic acid derivatives, and anti-radical scavenging activities of E. purpurea were assessed. The results showed the significant (p ≤ 0.01) differences among treatments, both in growth and phytochemical properties. Using of N slow release, especially in 150 mM dosage, significantly increased all the plant growth and phytochemical properties. The dried E. purpurea rhizomata cum radicibus contained more caftaric acid (max 12.56 mg g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW) and chicoric acid (max 7.56 mg g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW) than other derivatives. Despite the impact of heavy metals on yield and growth of E. purpurea, the concentration of all heavy metals and micronutrients (boron (B), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn)) in studied soil and fertilizer samples was less than United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) limits of contamination. Based on the results, using of N slow release fertilizers can improve phytochemical properties of the plant due to its polymeric structure and can be a suitable substitution of chemical fertilizers, especially in medicinal plants growth.">

        <span class="abst" title="Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease that affects one-third of the world's population. Although currently available TB drugs have many side effects, such as nausea, headache and gastrointestinal discomfort, no new anti-TB drugs have been produced in the past 30 years. Therefore, the discovery of a new anti-TB agent with minimal or no side effects is urgently needed. Many previous works have reported the effects of medicinal plants against &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; (MTB). However, none have focused on medicinal plants from the Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) region. This review highlights the effects of medicinal plants from the MENA region on TB. Medicinal plants from the MENA region have been successfully used as traditional medicine and first aid against TB related problems. A total of 184 plants species representing 73 families were studied. Amongst these species, 93 species contained more active compounds with strong anti-MTB activity (crude extracts and/or bioactive compounds with activities of 0-100 µg/ml). The extract of &lt;i&gt;Inula helenium, Khaya senegalensis, Premna odorata&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Rosmarinus officinalis&lt;/i&gt; presented the strongest anti-MTB activity. In addition, &lt;i&gt;Boswellia papyrifera&lt;/i&gt; (Del) Hochst olibanum, &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus camaldulensis&lt;/i&gt; Dehnh leaves (river red gum), &lt;i&gt;Nigella sativa&lt;/i&gt; (black cumin) seeds and genus &lt;i&gt;Cymbopogon&lt;/i&gt; exhibited anti-TB activity. The most potent bioactive compounds included alantolactone, octyl acetate, 1,8-cineole, thymoquinone, piperitone, α- verbenol, citral b and α-pinene. These compounds affect the permeability of microbial plasma membranes, thus kill the mycobacterium spp. As a conclusion, plant species collected from the MENA region are potential sources of novel drugs against TB.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Ethnopharmacological relevance&lt;/h4&gt;Due to the outbreaks such as SARS, bird flu and swine flu, which we frequently encounter in our century, we need fast solutions with no side effects today more than ever. Due to having vast ethnomedical experience and the richest flora (34% endemic) of Europe and the Middle East, Turkey has a high potential for research on this topic. Plants that locals have been using for centuries for the prevention and treatment of influenza can offer effective alternatives to combat this problem. In this context, 224 herbal taxa belonging to 45 families were identified among the selected 81 studies conducted in the seven regions of Turkey. However, only 35 (15.6%) of them were found to be subjected to worldwide in vitro and in vivo research conducted on anti-influenza activity. Quercetin and chlorogenic acid, the effectiveness of which has been proven many times in this context, have been recorded as the most common (7.1%) active ingredients among the other 56 active substances identified.&lt;h4&gt;Aim of the study&lt;/h4&gt;This study has been carried out to reveal the inventory of plant species that have been used in flu treatment for centuries in Turkish folk medicine, which could be used in the treatment of flu or flu-like pandemics, such as COVID 19, that humanity has been suffering with, and also compare them with experimental studies in the literature.&lt;h4&gt;Materials and methods&lt;/h4&gt;The investigation was conducted in two stages on the subject above by using electronic databases, such as Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, Medline, Cochrane Library, EBSCO, HighWire Press, PubMed and Google Scholar. The results of both scans are presented in separate tables, together with their regional comparative analysis.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Data obtained on taxa are presented in a table, including anti-influenza mechanism of actions and the active substances. Rosa canina (58.7%) and Mentha x piperita (22.2%) were identified as the most common plants used in Turkey. Also, Sambucus nigra (11.6%), Olea europaea (9.3%), Eucalyptus spp., Melissa officinalis, and Origanum vulgare (7.0%) emerged as the most investigated taxa.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;This is the first nationwide ethnomedical screening work conducted on flu treatment with plants in Turkey. Thirty-nine plants have been confirmed in the recent experimental anti-influenza research, which strongly shows that these plants are a rich pharmacological source. Also, with 189 (84.4%) taxa, detections that have not been investigated yet, they are an essential resource for both national and international pharmacological researchers in terms of new natural medicine searches. Considering that the production of antimalarial drugs and their successful use against COVID-19 has begun, this correlation was actually a positive and remarkable piece of data, since there are 15 plants, including Centaurea drabifolia subsp. Phlocosa (an endemic taxon), that were found to be used in the treatment of both flu and malaria.">

One hundred and six metabolites were identified that account for 92.1, 96.43, 87.43, 95.95, 92.90 and 89.48% of &lt;i&gt;Fc&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Fk&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Fp&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Fs&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Ft&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Fv&lt;/i&gt; whole essential oils, respectively. The data from the GC-MS analyses were subjected to unsupervised pattern recognition chemometric analysis utilizing principal component analysis (PCA) to improve the visualization of such differences among the six species. &lt;i&gt;Fk&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ft&lt;/i&gt; are very closely related to each other and were gathered together in one cluster. The antioxidant potential was assessed in vitro using different assays including 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS), cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC), ferric reducing power (FRAP) and phosphomolybdenum (PM) assays. &lt;i&gt;Ft&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Fp&lt;/i&gt; exhibited the most notable antioxidant properties as evidenced by their pronounced activities in most of the antioxidant assays performed, followed by &lt;i&gt;Fc&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Fk&lt;/i&gt; showed the most effective tyrosinase inhibitory potential, which was estimated as 119.67 mgKAE/g oil, while &lt;i&gt;Fp&lt;/i&gt; exhibited the most potent α-amylase inhibitory potential, which was equivalent to 2.61 mmol ACAE/g oil. Thus, it was concluded that &lt;i&gt;Ferula&lt;/i&gt; species could serve as a promising natural antioxidant drug that could be included in different products and spices to alleviate hyperglycemia and used as a natural ingredient in pharmaceutical cosmetics to counteract hyperpigmentation.">

Considering that drugs currently available for the treatment of inflammatory and cancer conditions show undesirable side effects, this research was designed to evaluate, for the first time, the in vitro anticancer activity of Algerian &lt;i&gt;Lavandula stoechas&lt;/i&gt; essential oil (LSEO) against different cancer cell lines, as well as its in vitro and in vivo topical and acute anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;h4&gt;Materials and methods&lt;/h4&gt;the LSEO was extracted by steam distillation, and chemical composition analysis was performed using gas chromatography. The main compounds identified in LSEO were oxygenated monoterpenes, such as 1,8-Cineole (61.36%). LSEO exhibited a potent anti-inflammatory activity using the xylene-induced mouse ear edema model.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;LSEO (200 and 20 mg/kg) was able to significantly reduce (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05) the carrageenan-induced paw edema with a similar effect to that observed for the positive control. Topical application of LSEO at doses of 82 and 410 mg/kg significantly reduced acute ear edema in 51.4% and 80.1% of the mice, respectively. Histological analysis confirmed that LSEO inhibited the skin inflammatory response. Moreover, LSEO was tested for its antitumor activity against different cancer cell lines. LSEO was found to be significantly active against human gastric adenocarcinoma (AGS), Melanoma MV3, and breast carcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells, with median inhibitory concentration (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) values of 0.035 ± 0.018, 0.06 ± 0.022 and 0.259 ± 0.089 µL/mL, respectively. Altogether, these results open a new field of investigation into the characterization of the molecules involved in anti-proliferative processes.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;We suggest that LSEO, with 1,8-Cineole as the major active component, is a promising candidate for use in skin care products with anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties. The results of this study may provide an experimental basis for further systematic research, rational development, and clinical utilization of lavender resources.">

        <span class="abst" title="Biocellulose, named &quot;the biomaterial of the future&quot;, is a natural and ecologically friendly polymer, produced by selected acetic acid bacteria strains. Biocellulose impregnated with antimicrobial agents can be used as a novel, safe, and biodegradable food packaging material, helping extend the shelf life of some products and may also have the chance to replace typical plastic packaging, which is a big environmental problem these days. This study aimed to evaluate if cellulose impregned with natural oregano essential oil could show antibacterial activity against &lt;i&gt;Cronobacter&lt;/i&gt; strains, which can occur in food, causing diseases and food poisoning. Bacterial cellulose was obtained from two acetic bacteria strains, &lt;i&gt;Gluconacetobacter hansenii&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 23769 and &lt;i&gt;Komagataeibacter&lt;/i&gt; sp. GH1. Antibacterial activity was studied by the disc-diffusion method against chosen &lt;i&gt;Cronobacter&lt;/i&gt; strains, isolated from the plant matrix. Oregano essential oil has been shown to penetrate into the structure of bacterial cellulose, and after applying cellulose to the solid medium, it showed the ability to migrate. Biopolymer from the strain &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;. sp. GH1 was able to better absorb and retain essential oregano oil (OEO) compared to bacterial cellulose (BC) produced by the &lt;i&gt;G. hansenii&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 23769. Bacterial cellulose with oregano essential oil from strain &lt;i&gt;Komagataeibacter&lt;/i&gt; GH1 showed generally greater inhibitory properties for the growth of tested strains than its equivalent obtained from &lt;i&gt;G. hansenii&lt;/i&gt;. This was probably due to the arrangement of the polymer fibers and its final thickness. The largest zone of inhibition of strain growth was observed in relation to &lt;i&gt;C. condimenti&lt;/i&gt; s37 (32.75 mm ± 2.8). At the same time, the control sample using filter paper showed an inhibition zone of 36.0 mm ± 0.7. A similar inhibition zone (28.33 mm ± 2.6) was observed for the &lt;i&gt;C. malonaticus&lt;/i&gt; lv31 strain, while the zone in the control sample was 27.1 mm ± 0.7. Based on this study, it was concluded that bacterial cellulose impregnated with oregano essential oil has strong and moderate antimicrobial activity against all presented strains of the genus &lt;i&gt;Cronobacter&lt;/i&gt; isolated from plant matrix. Obtained results give a strong impulse to use this biopolymer as ecological food packaging in the near future.">

This review focuses particularly on thyme as an alternative natural antioxidant and antimicrobial with potential use in the food industry. This is in line with the preferences of the current consumer, who demands healthier and more natural products. Different studies have concluded that the use of thyme increases stability and reduces lipid oxidation during the shelf-life period of foods (meat, meat products, milk, fish or fish products), which makes thyme a promising source of natural additives. Despite these findings, the use of &lt;i&gt;Thymus&lt;/i&gt; extracts or essential oils as natural additives in foods is reduced in comparison with other natural preservative extracts. This review provides an overview of the most important information on the positive effect of the bioactive compounds of thyme and its uses as a preservative in foods, taking into account its origin (from plants, plant extracts or essential oils).">

        <span class="abst" title="Invasive species are considered as one of the major threats to ecosystems worldwide. Although invasive plants are regarded as a foe, they could be considered as natural resources for valuable bioactive compounds. The present study aimed to characterize the chemical composition of the essential oil (EO) from the invasive plant &lt;i&gt;Argemone ochroleuca&lt;/i&gt; Sweet, collected from Saudi Arabia, as well as to evaluate its phytotoxic activity. Seventy-four compounds were characterized via GC-MS analysis of EO representing 98.75% of the overall mass. The oxygenated constituents (79.01%) were found as the main constituents, including mono- (43.27%), sesqui- (17.67%), and di-terpenes (0.53%), as well as hydrocarbons (16.81%) and carotenoids (0.73%). Additionally, 19.69% from the overall mass was characterized as non-oxygenated compounds with mono- (1.77%), sesquiterpenes (17.41%), and hydrocarbons (0.56%) as minors. From all identified constituents, &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-chrysanthenyl acetate (25.71%), &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt;-cadinene (11.70%), oleic acid, methyl ester (7.37%), terpinene-4-ol (4.77%), dihydromyrcenol (2.90%), &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-muurolene (1.77%), and &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt;-himachalene (1.56%) were found as abundant. The EO of &lt;i&gt;A. ochroleuca&lt;/i&gt; showed significant phytotoxic activity against the test plant &lt;i&gt;Lactuca sativa&lt;/i&gt; and the noxious weed &lt;i&gt;Peganum harmala.&lt;/i&gt; The EO attained IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 92.1, 128.6, and 131.6 µL L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for seedling root growth, germination, and shoot growth of &lt;i&gt;L. sativa&lt;/i&gt;, respectively, while it had IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 134.8, 145.7, and 147.9 µL L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, for &lt;i&gt;P. harmala&lt;/i&gt;. Therefore, this EO could be used as a bioherbicide against weeds, while further study is recommended for the characterization of the authentic materials of the main compounds in the EO as well as for the evaluation of potency of this oil on a field scale and the determination of its biosafety.">

The essential oil was separated by hydrodistillation, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to identify its constituents. A total of twenty-seven compounds was identified from the EO, and its major components were 1-octanol (42.217%), geraniol (19.914%), and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-ol (13.151%). Solvent extraction and fractionation were applied for preparing the ethanol extract (crude extract, CE), petroleum ether extract (PE), ethyl acetate extract (EE), &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-butanol extract (BE), and water extract (WE). The CE, EE and BE were abundant in phenols and flavonoids, and EE had the highest total phenol and total flavonoid contents. Gallic acid, ethyl gallate, rosavin and herbacetin were identified in the EE. The antibacterial activity results showed that the EO exhibited moderate inhibitory activity to the typical clinic bacteria, and EE exhibited the strongest antibacterial activity among the five extracts. For the compounds, ethyl gallate showed the strongest inhibitory activity to the test bacteria, and its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) value for all the tested bacteria was 0.24 mg/mL and 0.48 mg/mL, respectively. The results of antioxidant activity showed that both CE and EE exhibited strong antioxidant activities in the DPPH radical scavenging and Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; reducing power tests, however, EO showed relatively weaker antioxidant ability. Ethyl gallate and rosavin exhibited excellent activity in the DPPH radical scavenging assay, and their IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value was 5.3 µg/mL and 5.9 µg/mL, respectively. Rosavin showed better reduction power activity than the other three compounds. These results could provide more evidence for the traditional use of &lt;i&gt;R. crenulata&lt;/i&gt;, and would be helpful for improving its application further.">

        <span class="abst" title="Human trichomoniasis, caused by the pathogenic parasitic protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis, is the most common non-viral sexually transmitted disease that contributes to reproductive morbidity in affected women and possibly to prostate cancer in men. Tritrichomonas foetus strains cause the disease trichomoniasis in farm animals (cattle, bulls, pigs) and diarrhea in domestic animals (cats and dogs). Because some T. vaginalis strains have become resistant to the widely used drug metronidazole, there is a need to develop alternative treatments, based on safe natural products that have the potential to replace and/or enhance the activity of lower doses of metronidazole. To help meet this need, this overview collates and interprets worldwide reported studies on the efficacy of structurally different classes of food, marine, and medicinal plant extracts and some of their bioactive pure compounds against T. vaginalis and T. foetus in vitro and in infected mice and women. Active food extracts include potato peels and their glycoalkaloids α-chaconine and α-solanine, caffeic and chlorogenic acids, and quercetin; the tomato glycoalkaloid α-tomatine; theaflavin-rich black tea extracts and bioactive theaflavins; plant essential oils and their compounds (+)-α-bisabolol and eugenol; the grape skin compound resveratrol; the kidney bean lectin, marine extracts from algae, seaweeds, and fungi and compounds that are derived from fungi; medicinal extracts and about 30 isolated pure compounds. Also covered are the inactivation of drug-resistant T. vaginalis and T. foetus strains by sensitized light; anti-trichomonad effects in mice and women; beneficial effects of probiotics in women; and mechanisms that govern cell death. The summarized findings will hopefully stimulate additional research, including molecular-mechanism-guided inactivations and human clinical studies, that will help ameliorate adverse effects of pathogenic protozoa.">

        <span class="abst" title="Rosemary (&lt;i&gt;Rosmarinus officinalis&lt;/i&gt; L.) is an evergreen bushy shrub which grows along the Mediterranean Sea, and sub-Himalayan areas. In folk medicine, it has been used as an antispasmodic, mild analgesic, to cure intercostal neuralgia, headaches, migraine, insomnia emotional upset, and depression. Different investigations have highlighted rosemary neuropharmacological properties as their main topics. Rosemary has significant antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-apoptotic, anti-tumorigenic, antinociceptive, and neuroprotective properties. Furthermore, it shows important clinical effects on mood, learning, memory, pain, anxiety, and sleep. The aim of the current work is to review the potential neuropharmacological effects of different rosemary extracts and its active constituents on nervous system disorders, their relevant mechanisms and its preclinical application to recall the therapeutic potential of this herb and more directions of future research projects. The data were gathered by searching the English articles in PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. The keywords used as search terms were '&lt;i&gt;Rosmarinus officinalis&lt;/i&gt;', 'rosemary', 'nervous system', 'depression', 'memory', 'Alzheimer's disease' 'epilepsy', 'addiction', 'neuropathic pain', and 'disorders'. All kinds of related articles, abstracts and books were included. No time limitation was considered. Both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies were subjected to this investigation. This review authenticates that rosemary has appeared as a worthy source for curing inflammation, analgesic, anti-anxiety, and memory boosting. It also arranges new perception for further investigations on isolated constituents, especially carnosic acid, rosmarinic acid, and essential oil to find exquisite therapeutics and support drug discovery with fewer side effects to help people suffering from nervous system disorders.">

Although chemical free methods are acceptable, they call for an extensive processing time, while the yield and quality from these methods are often disappointing. This work utilizes subcritical water technology to address these issues. In this undertaking, essential oil was extracted from &lt;i&gt;Aquilaria malaccensis&lt;/i&gt; wood by way of subcritical conditions, and characterized through gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS). Optimization through response surface methodology revealed temperature to be the most critical factor for the extraction process, while the optimum conditions for temperature, sample-to-solvent ratio, and time for subcritical water extraction was revealed as 225 °C, 0.2 gr/mL, and 17 min, respectively. The subcritical water extraction technique involves two simultaneous processes, which are based on good fitting to the two-site kinetic and second order model. In comparison to the hydrodistillation method, GC/MS results indicated that the quality of &lt;i&gt;A. malaccensis&lt;/i&gt;' wood oils, derived through the subcritical water technique, are of significantly better quality, while containing many constructive value-added compounds, such as furfural and guaiacol, which are useful for the production of pesticides and medicines. Pore size, functional groups, and morphology analysis revealed the occurrence of substantial damage to the samples, which facilitated an improved extraction of bio-products. In comparison to conventional methods, the use of the subcritical method not only involves a shorter processing time, but also delivers a higher oil yield and quality.">

It aims to provide detailed information on diversity, distribution, use pattern, and conservation status of selected NTFPs that have market potential, and suggest a possible way for their sustained management and possible role in livelihood upgradation of dependent communities.&lt;h4&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;An inventory of NTFP species was prepared by collecting secondary information from published scientific studies in journals, books, and other periodicals as well as species being traded as per Forest department records. Search on various online databases were also used (Scopus, Google Scholar, PubMed, ISI Web of Science) using specific search terms such as &quot;non-timber forest products,&quot; &quot;NTFPs,&quot; &quot;medicinal plants,&quot; &quot;wild edible plants,&quot; and &quot;Himachal Pradesh,&quot; &quot;Western Himalaya,&quot; and &quot;Northwest Himalaya.&quot; A list of potential NTFPs was prepared having market value. To evaluate the relative usefulness of different species, a quantitative valuation was also used by calculating various indices, such as use value (UV), relative frequency of citation (RFC), relative importance index (RI), cultural importance index (CI), and cultural value (CV).&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;A total of 811 species have been screened that has significant potential for the State, and categorized in 18 groups as per their use. The family use value was highest for Asteraceae (FUV = 76.75). Among plant parts used, whole plants, roots (including rhizomes and tubers), leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, stems, and barks were used by the forest dwellers. Maximum NTFPs were collected from the warm temperate zone, followed by the temperate, sub-alpine, sub-tropical, and alpine zones. Sixty-one percent of species had medicinal importance, followed by species used for food and fodder purposes. Although species richness of medicinal plants decreased with altitude, however, most plants extracted from high altitudes were high-value species fetching better income. As many as 125 NTFPs were identified under the diverse level of threats according to IUCN criteria and as per the local stakeholders' perceptions.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;High dependence on NTFPs by poor and marginal communities for domestic needs as well as market demand of selected species leads to create excessive pressure on them. Unfortunately, the state agencies are not having any robust conservation plan for NTFPs. For long-term management of NTFPs sector, a species-specific conservation strategy, proper harvesting protocol, cultivation practices, the supply of quality planting material, product development and diversification, value chain development, and ensured market is greatly desired. This will not only lead to conserving NTFPs resources in their natural habitats but also lead a sustainable livelihood generation for forest dwellers.">

        <span class="abst" title="Asarum heterotropoides Fr. var. mandshuricum (Maxim) Kitag (Chinese wild ginger) is an important medicinal herb. Essential oil extracted from its roots is the key ingredient and is mainly composed of phenylpropanoid compounds. As a skiophyte plant, light is a crucial factor for A. heterotropoides var. mandshuricum growth and metabolism. To investigate the effects of light irradiation on the essential oil biosynthesis in A. heterotropoides var. mandshuricum, the plants were cultivated in four light irradiation treatments (100, 50, 24 and 12% full sunlight). The photosynthetic capacity, essential oil content and composition, activities of several enzymes and levels of some secondary metabolites involved in the shikimic acid and cinnamic acid pathways were analyzed. The leaf mass per area, average diurnal net photosynthetic rate, and the essential oil content increased significantly with increasing light intensity. Phenylalanine, cinnamic acid, and p-coumaric acid in the cinnamic acid pathway were at their highest levels in plants cultivated in 100% full sunlight. The highest content of shikimic acid in the shikimic acid pathway was obtained in plants grown in 50% sunlight transmittance. The activity of the enzymes 3-Deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, cinnamate-4-hydroxylase and 4-coumarate:CoA ligase increased proportionally with light intensity. Overall, we conclude that high light irradiation promotes high net photosynthetic rate, high activity of enzymes and high amounts of phenylpropanoid precursor metabolites leading to significant biosynthesis of essential oil in A. heterotropoides var. mandshuricum.">

Among others, Salvia hydrangea is an endemic half-shrub belonging to the Lamiaceae family that has been widely used from ancient times in Iranian traditional medicine. The aim of this study was to compare the composition and antimicrobial properties of essential oils obtained from leaves or flowers of this plant, collected from the Daran region of Iran during June 2018. The oils were obtained using Clevenger apparatus, their composition was evaluated by means of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and the antimicrobial properties were assayed by measuring inhibition halos, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). The yield of leaf oil was ~ 0.25% and that of flower oil was ~ 0.28%. Oil composition was affected by the part of the plants used: the most abundant bioactives contained in leaf essential oil were (+)-spathulenol (16.07%), 1,8-cineole (13.96%), trans-caryophyllene (9.58%), β-pinene (8.91%) and β-eudesmol (5.33%) and those in flower essential oil were caryophyllene oxide (35.47%), 1,8-cineole (9.54%), trans-caryophyllene (6.36%), β-eudesmol (4.11%), caryophyllenol-II (3.46%) and camphor (3.33%). Both the oils showed a significant inhibitory and lethal effect on the Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC ~ 16 µg/mL), Shigella dysenteriae and Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC ~ 62 µg/mL). Therefore, the essential oils obtained from both leaves and flowers of S. hydrangea may have potential application as bactericidal agents against some bacteria.">

Among the communities of coconut breakers women, babassu oil is used in culinary, as fuel, and mostly as medicinal oil for the treatment of skin wounds and inflammation. This study aimed to evaluate in vitro and in vivo the wound healing effects of babassu oil. In vitro, babassu oil increased the migration of L929 fibroblasts, inhibited the production of nitric oxide by LPS-stimulated peritoneal macrophages, and increased the levels of INF-&lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt; and IL-6 cytokines production. In vivo, babassu oil accelerated the healing process in a full-thickness splinted wound model, by an increase in the fibroblasts number, blood vessels, and collagen deposition in the wounds. The babassu oil also increased the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the wound site and showed an anti-inflammatory effect in a chronic ear edema model, reducing ear thickness, epidermal hyperplasia, and myeloperoxidase activity. Thus, these data corroborate the use of babassu oil in folk medicine as a remedy to treat skin wounds.">

According to our method, the benefits/risks assessment of the herbal medicines was found to be positive in 5 cases (&lt;i&gt;Althaea officinalis, Commiphora molmol, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Hedera helix&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Sambucus nigra&lt;/i&gt;), promising in 12 cases (&lt;i&gt;Allium sativum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Andrographis paniculata&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Echinacea angustifolia, Echinacea purpurea, Eucalyptus globulus&lt;/i&gt; essential oil&lt;i&gt;, Justicia pectoralis, Magnolia officinalis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Mikania glomerata&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pelargonium sidoides&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pimpinella anisum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Salix&lt;/i&gt; sp, &lt;i&gt;Zingiber officinale&lt;/i&gt;), and unknown for the rest. On the same grounds, only ibuprofen resulted promising, but we could not find compelling evidence to endorse the use of paracetamol and/or codeine.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Our work suggests that several herbal medicines have safety margins superior to those of reference drugs and enough levels of evidence to start a clinical discussion about their potential use as adjuvants in the treatment of early/mild common flu in otherwise healthy adults within the context of COVID-19. While these herbal medicines will not cure or prevent the flu, they may both improve general patient well-being and offer them an opportunity to personalize the therapeutic approaches.">

Synthetic anthelmintics are most commonly used to control CE, however, prolonged use of these drugs may result in many adverse effects. This study aims to discuss the in vitro/in vivo scolicidal efficacy of different medicinal plants and their components used against Echinococcus granulosus. Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, PubMed and Scopus were used to retrieve the published literature from 2000-2020. A total of 62 published articles met the eligibility criteria and were reviewed. A total of 52 plant species belonging to 22 families have been reported to be evaluated as scolicidal agents against E. granulosus worldwide. Most extensively used medicinal plants against E. granulosus belong to the family Lamiaceae (25.0%) followed by Apiaceae (11.3%). Among various plant parts, leaves (36.0%) were most commonly used. Essential oils of Zataria multiflora and Ferula asafetida at a concentration of 0.02, and 0.06 mg/ml showed 100% in vitro scolicidal activity after 10 min post application, respectively. Z. multiflora also depicted high in vivo efficacy by decreasing weight and size while also causing extensive damage to the germinal layer of the cysts. Plant-based compounds like berberine, thymol, and thymoquinone have shown high efficacy against E. granulosus. These plant species and compounds could be potentially used for the development of an effective drug against E. granulosus, if further investigated for in vivo efficacy, toxicity, and mechanism of drug action in future research.">

This study aims to evaluate the total phenolic content and antioxidant, antihyperlipidemic, and antidiabetogenic activities of &lt;i&gt;O. dillenii&lt;/i&gt; seeds oil (ODSO), in vivo. The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging assay and the Folin-Ciocalteu method were applied in this study to determine antioxidant activity and total phenolic content of ODSO, respectively. The antihyperlipidemic effect of the ODSO (2 ml/kg) was evaluated in the high-fat diet-fed albino mice, relying on lipid profile, blood glucose, and growth performance variations. Moreover, the preventive effect of ODSO was evaluated against alloxan monohydrate-induced diabetes in albino mice. ODSO had the highest total phenolic content (518.18 ± 14.36 mg EAC/kg) and DPPH scavenging activity (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.38 ± 0.08 mg/mL). Furthermore, ODSO showed a significant antidiabetogenic effect by reducing bodyweight loss, blood sugar level rise, and mortality rate caused by alloxan in albino mice. Then, ODSO has exhibited a significant antihyperlipidemic effect by improving the lipid profile disorder and glucose level rise in the blood, produced by the high-fat diet-fed albino mice. Results suggest that antidiabetogenic and antihyperlipidemic activities of ODSO correlate to the phenolic content and antioxidant activity of this oil. Hence, this plant could be a significant source of medically important critical compounds.">

Eighty male golden hamsters were randomly divided into 10 groups and received low or high dose of bergamot and sweet orange juice and essential oil, physiological saline, and positive drugs for four weeks, respectively. Results showed that all interventions could improve acne vulgaris by reducing the growth rate of sebaceous gland spots, inhibiting TG accumulation, decreasing the release of inflammatory cytokines (notably reducing IL-1&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; levels), promoting apoptosis in the sebaceous gland, and decreasing the ratio of T/E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Moreover, immunoadjuvants can support immune system acting on nonimmune targets, thus improving the immune response. The modulation of inflammatory pathways and microbiome can also contribute to control the immune function. Some plant-based nutraceuticals have been studied as possible immunomodulating agents due to their multiple and pleiotropic effects. Being usually more tolerable than pharmacological treatments, their adjuvant contribution is approached as a desirable nutraceutical strategy. In the present review, the up to date knowledge about the immunomodulating properties of polysaccharides, fatty acids and labdane diterpenes have been analyzed, in order to give scientific basic and clinical evidence to support their practical use. Since promising evidence in preclinical studies, limited and sometimes confusing results have been highlighted in clinical trials, likely due to low methodological quality and lacking standardization. More investigations of high quality and specificity are required to describe in depth the usefulness of these plant-derived nutraceuticals in the immune system modulation, for health promoting and disease preventing purposes.">

Recently, an increase in the consumption of antioxidant supplements was observed globally. The main sources of these antioxidants include fruits, vegetables, and beverage. Herbal infusions are highly popular beverages consumed daily for different reasons. Studies showed the potent antioxidant effects of plants used in the preparation of some herbal infusions. Such herbal infusions represent an important source of antioxidants and can be used as a dietary protection against cancer. However, uncontrolled consumption of herbal infusions may cause toxicity and reduced antioxidant activity. In this review, eleven widely consumed herbal infusions were evaluated for their antioxidant capacities, anticancer potential and possible toxicity. These herbal infusions are highly popular and consumed as daily drinks in different countries.

        <span class="abst" title="Kuromoji (&lt;i&gt;Lindera umbellata&lt;/i&gt;) is a tree that grows throughout Japan. The components of kuromoji essential oil have antitumor and aromatherapy effects. However, the composition of the hydrosol, obtained as a by-product of the essential oil process, is unknown. Furthermore, it is unknown whether kuromoji essential oil has a deodorizing effect. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to compare the chemical composition of kuromoji essential oil and hydrosol, as well as evaluate the deodorizing effect of the former. The chemical composition of samples was evaluated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Additionally, the deodorizing effect of Kuromoji essential oil was investigated with the detector tube method using ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, and isovaleric acid. Linalool was the most abundant component in both the essential oil and hydrosol; however, its proportion was higher in the hydrosol (57.5%) than in the essential oil (42.8%). The hydrosol contained fewer chemical components, but higher proportions of trans-geraniol and ethanol. Moreover, the essential oil eliminated 50% of ammonia and 97.6% or more of isovaleric acid. Interestingly, linalool was soluble in the hydrosol and did not irritate the skin. This suggests that the hydrosol may be an effective foot care product.">

        <span class="abst" title="Essential oils of sweet lime peel, a waste by-product in the juice industry, were extracted using the vacuum assisted solvent free microwave extraction (VASFME) method. The effects of microwave output power (500-1000 W) and extraction time (20-30 min) on the essential oils yield and antimicrobial property were investigated. Optimal conditions were observed at 797.844 W microwave output power and 30 min extraction time. The essential oils yield and antimicrobial property under these conditions were 0.792 ± 0.03% and 18.25 ± 1.45 mm, respectively, which agrees with the predicted values of 0.757% and 16.50 mm. The essential oils were extracted at optimized conditions and analyzed through GCMS for compound identification. A total of 49 compounds were identified, with limonene content (43.47%) being the highest among all sweet lime peel oil compounds. Moreover, the sweet lime peels were subjected to ultrasound pre-treatment before microwave extraction. The ultrasound pre-treatment helped to increase the essential oils yield from 0.84 to 1.06% as the treatment time increased from 30 to 90 min. The increase in yield was 37.66% more compared to VASFME at 90 min treatment time.">

Moreover, a bibliographic research meant to validate or refute the uses, focusing on the potentially responsible compounds, was performed. Fifty-nine species, attributable to 30 families (Asteraceae, Pinaceae, Malvaceae, and Lamiaceae the most cited), were mentioned. &lt;i&gt;Arnica montana&lt;/i&gt;, anti-inflammatory for traumas and musculoskeletal pains; &lt;i&gt;Pinus mugo&lt;/i&gt;, expectorant; &lt;i&gt;Malva sylvestris&lt;/i&gt;, anti-inflammatory and soothing; &lt;i&gt;Achillea moschata&lt;/i&gt;, digestive. The compounds, responsible for the therapeutic activities, are often polyphenols and terpenoids: helenanin in &lt;i&gt;A. montana&lt;/i&gt;, α-pinene, δ-3-carene, and limonene in &lt;i&gt;P. mugo&lt;/i&gt;, gossypin and malvin in &lt;i&gt;M. sylvestris&lt;/i&gt;, luteolin and apigenin in &lt;i&gt;A. moschata&lt;/i&gt;. Scientific evidence for at least one of the traditional activities described was found for 50 species but only in 26 out of 196 works consulted, it is possible to make a comparison between investigated extracts and traditional preparations. This study is thus a stimulus to new phytochemical investigations, mimicking as much as possible the traditional preparations.

Various oriental and Asian cultures kept records of its production and numerous uses. Due to the similarities between industrial hemp (fiber and grain) and the narcotic/medical type of Cannabis, the production of industrial hemp was prohibited in most countries, wiping out centuries of learning and genetic resources. In the past two decades, most countries have legalized industrial hemp production, prompting a significant amount of research on the health benefits of hemp and hemp products. Current research is yet to verify the various health claims of the numerous commercially available hemp products. Hence, this review aims to compile recent advances in the science of industrial hemp, with respect to its use as value-added functional food ingredients/nutraceuticals and health benefits, while also highlighting gaps in our current knowledge and avenues of future research on this high-value multi-use plant for the global food chain.">

        <span class="abst" title="Cannabis is an annual plant with a long history of use as food, feed, fiber, oil, medicine, and narcotics. Despite realizing its true value, it has not yet found its true place. Cannabis has had a long history with many ups and downs, and now it is our turn to promote it. Cannabis contains approximately 600 identified and many yet unidentified potentially useful compounds. Cannabinoids, phenolic compounds, terpenoids, and alkaloids are some of the secondary metabolites present in cannabis. However, among a plethora of unique chemical compounds found in this plant, the most important ones are phytocannabinoids (PCs). Over hundreds of 21-22-carbon compounds exclusively produce in cannabis glandular hairs through either polyketide and or deoxyxylulose phosphate/methylerythritol phosphate (DOXP/MEP) pathways. Trans-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are those that first come to mind while talking about cannabis. Nevertheless, despite the low concentration, cannabinol (CBN), cannabigerol (CBG), cannabichromene (CBC), tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), cannabidivarin (CBDV), cannabinodiol (CBND), and cannabinidiol (CBDL) may have potentially some medical effects. PCs and endocannabinoids (ECs) mediate their effects mainly through CB1 and CB2 receptors. Despite all concerns regarding cannabis, nobody can ignore the use of cannabinoids as promising tonic, analgesic, antipyretic, antiemetic, anti-inflammatory, anti-epileptic, anticancer agents, which are effective for pain relief, depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, nausea and vomiting, multiple sclerosis, cardiovascular disorders, and appetite stimulation. The scientific community and public society have now increasingly accepted cannabis specifically hemp as much more than a recreational drug. There are growing demands for cannabinoids, mainly CBD, with many diverse therapeutic and nutritional properties in veterinary or human medicine. The main objective of this review article is to historically summarize findings concerning cannabinoids, mainly THC and CBD, towards putting these valuable compounds into food, feed and health baskets and current and future trends in the consumption of products derived from cannabis.">

Seed oils of six populations were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatograph/mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The HPLC analysis indicated that &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;harmala&lt;/i&gt; seed oil exhibited a very high level of tocopherol contents, with values in the range of 2385.66-2722.68 mg/100 g. The most abundant tocopherol isomer was δ-tocopherol (90.39%), followed by γ-tocopherol (8.08%) and α-tocopherol (1.14%). We discovered for the first time the presence of tocotrenols in &lt;i&gt;P. harmala&lt;/i&gt; seed oils of the six populations studied. The GC-MS analyses revealed that linoleic acid was the main fatty acid (65.17%), followed by oleic acid (23.12%), palmitic acid (5.36%) and stearic acid (3.08%). We also studied the antifungal activity of seed oil of the Medenine (MD) population on ten fungal pathogens. The antifungal effects differed among pathogens and depended on oil concentrations. Seed oil of the MD population caused a significant decrease in mycelial growth of all fungi tested, with values ranging 31.50-82.11%, except for &lt;i&gt;Alternaria&lt;/i&gt; sp., which showed no inhibition. The antifungal activity against the 10 selected fungi can be explained by the richness in tocols of the extracted oil and make &lt;i&gt;P. harmala&lt;/i&gt; a promising crop for biological control. Furthermore, the importance of fatty acids and the wide geographic spread in Tunisia of this species make this crop a potential source of renewable energy.">

(common mugwort) is a species with great importance in the history of medicine and was called the &quot;mother of herbs&quot; in the Middle Ages. It is a common herbaceous plant that exhibits high morphological and phytochemical variability depending on the location where it occurs. This species is well known almost all over the world. Its herb-&lt;i&gt;Artemisiae vulgaris herba&lt;/i&gt;-is used as a raw material due to the presence of essential oil, flavonoids, and sesquiterpenoids lactones and their associated biological activities. The European Pharmacopoeia has listed this species as a potential homeopathic raw material. Moreover, this species has been used in traditional Chinese, Hindu, and European medicine to regulate the functioning of the gastrointestinal system and treat various gynecological diseases. The general aim of this review was to analyze the progress of phytochemical and pharmacological as well as professional scientific studies focusing on &lt;i&gt;A. vulgaris&lt;/i&gt;. Thus far, numerous authors have confirmed the beneficial properties of &lt;i&gt;A. vulgaris&lt;/i&gt; herb extracts, including their antioxidant, hepatoprotective, antispasmolytic, antinociceptive, estrogenic, cytotoxic, antibacterial, and antifungal effects. In addition, several works have reviewed the use of this species in the production of cosmetics and its role as a valuable spice in the food industry. Furthermore, biotechnological micropropagation of &lt;i&gt;A. vulgaris&lt;/i&gt; has been analyzed.">

The use of HPH led to qualitative and quantitative differences between the volatile profiles of the HD and the nanoemulsion of &lt;i&gt;S. satureioides&lt;/i&gt; essential oil. Whereas borneol, α-terpineol, and thymol were the predominant constituents in the HD oil, carvacrol, thymol, and γ-terpinene were the major constituents in the nanoemulsion. The antioxidant activity of the &lt;i&gt;S. satureioides&lt;/i&gt; essential oil nanoemulsion displayed was lower as compared to that of HD oil using DPPH free radical-scavenging, CUPRAC, and ABTS assays. This is consistent with the differences in total flavonoid, total phenolic, and volatiles detected in both HD oil and its nanoemulsion.

The total phenolic and flavonoid contents and phenolic compounds profile analyzed spectrophotometrically and by high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC), respectively, were evaluated in the developed tinctures. The results showed that the tinctures prepared from the &lt;i&gt;S. montana&lt;/i&gt; herb by maceration or remaceration are rich in polyphenols, and there is an influence of the technological factors (particle size and extraction mode) on the total phenolic and flavonoid contents.

Thus, the high contents of polyphenols and flavonoids in the developed tinctures and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-thymol among the volatile components of the &lt;i&gt;S. montana&lt;/i&gt; essential oil could indicate the promising antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of these herbal preparations.

All pretreatments improved essential oil yield compared to no-pretreatment control (40-64% yield increase), while the oil quality remained mostly unchanged (as shown by statistical analysis of GC-MS results). However, enzyme-assisted reflux extraction pretreatment did not significantly outperform reflux extraction (no-enzyme control), suggesting that the observed yield increase was mostly a consequence of reflux extraction and enzymatic activity had only a minute effect.

In the present study, we therefore evaluated these effects of tangerine essential oil by measurement of electroencephalography (EEG) activity with 32 channel platforms according to the international 10-20 system in 10 male and 10 female subjects. Then the sleep onset latency was studied to further confirm the effect on sleep activity. The results revealed that different concentrations, subthreshold to suprathreshold, of tangerine oil gave different brain responses. Undiluted tangerine oil inhalation reduced slow and fast alpha wave powers and elevated low and mid beta wave powers. The subthreshold and threshold dilution showed the opposite effect to the brain compared with suprathreshold concentration. Inhalation of threshold concentration showed effectively decreased alpha and beta wave powers and increased theta wave power, which emphasize its sedative effect. The reduction of sleep onset latency was confirmed with the implementation of the observed sedative effect of tangerine oil.">

        <span class="abst" title="(1) Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and the imposition of strict but necessary measures to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus have been, and still are, major stress factors for adults, children, and adolescents. Stress harms human health as it creates free radicals in the human body. According to various recent studies, volatile oils from various aromatic plants have a high content of antioxidants and antimicrobial compounds. An external supply of antioxidants is required to destroy these free radicals. The main purpose of this paper is to create a yoghurt with high antioxidant capacity, using only raw materials from Romania; (2) Methods: The bioactive components used to enrich the cow milk yoghurt were extracted as volatile oils out of four aromatic plants: basil, mint, lavender and fennel. Initially, the compounds were extracted to determine the antioxidant capacity, and subsequently, the antioxidant activity of the yoghurt was determined. The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhy-drazyl (DPPH) method was used to determine the antioxidant activity; (3) Results: The results show that cow milk yoghurt enhanced with volatile oils of basil, lavender, mint and fennel, encapsulated in sodium alginate has an antioxidant and antimicrobial effect as a staple food with multiple effects in increasing the body's immunity. The antioxidant activity proved to be considerably higher than the control sample. The highest antioxidant activity was obtained on the first day of the analysis, decreasing onwards to measurements taken on days 10 and 20. The cow milk yoghurt enriched with volatile basil oil obtained the best results; (4) Conclusions: The paper shows that yoghurts with a high antioxidant capacity were obtained, using only raw materials from Romania. A healthy diet, compliance with safety conditions and finding appropriate and safe methods to increase the body's immunity is a good alternative to a major transition through harder times, such as pandemics. The creation of food products that include natural antioxidant compounds combines both the current great possibility of developing food production in Romania and the prevention and reduction of the effects caused by pandemic stress in the human body.">

Rats in the BCP, PmEO100CP, PmEO200CP, PmEO400CP and PmEO400 group received respective treatment orally for 14 consecutive days prior to cisplatin injection. All animals except for those in the control group and PmEO400 were administered with a single dose of cisplatin (10 mg/kg) intraperitoneally on day 15 and all animals were sacrificed on day 18. PmEO100CP pretreatment protected against cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity by decreasing CYP2E1 and indicators of oxidative stress including malondialdehyde, 8-OHdG and protein carbonyl which was accompanied by increased antioxidant status (glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase) as compared to cisplatin group. PmEO100CP pretreatment also modulated changes in liver inflammatory markers (TNF-α, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10). PmEO100CP administration also notably reduced cisplatin-induced apoptosis significantly as compared to cisplatin group. In conclusion, our results suggested that &lt;i&gt;P. minus&lt;/i&gt; essential oil at a dose of 100 mg/kg may protect against cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity possibly via inhibition of oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis.">

OmEO (1% and 3%) was inhaled for 21 consecutive days, while Aβ1-42 was administered intracerebroventricularly to induce AD-like symptoms. Our data demonstrate that OmEO increased antioxidant activity and enhanced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression, which in concert contributed to the improvement of cognitive function of animals. Moreover, OmEO presented beneficial effects on memory performance in Y-maze and radial arm-maze tests in the Aβ1-42 rat AD model.">

Rausch.) are aromatic plants with considerable economic value. These plants and their essential oils are used in medicine, cosmetics, and the food industry. One of the main limiting factors in peppermint and chamomile commercial cultivation is weed competition since weeds are able to decrease both oil amount and biomass yield. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of parasitism by field dodder (&lt;i&gt;Cuscuta campestris&lt;/i&gt; Yunck.) on peppermint and chamomile dry weight and their essential oil yield and composition. Essential oils from both noninfested and infested peppermint and chamomile plants were obtained by hydrodistillation and characterized chemically by gas chromatography (GC) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS). The amount of dry matter accumulated by peppermint and chamomile plants infested by field dodder was lower (25% and 63%, respectively) compared to noninfested plants. Essential oil yield increased for peppermint (3.87% (&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;w&lt;/i&gt;) and 3.63% (&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;w&lt;/i&gt;)), but decreased for chamomile (0.2% (&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;w&lt;/i&gt;) and 0.5% (&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;w&lt;/i&gt;)) both from infested and noninfested plants, respectively. The oil composition profile significantly differed in terms of content. In peppermint plants, field dodder infestation increased menthone content by 23%, and decreased the content of both menthol by 11% and pulegone by 67%. Furthermore, δ-cadinene was detected only in oil extracted from infested peppermint plants. Compared to peppermint, chamomile plants were significantly more affected by field dodder in terms of essential oil yield, as well as oil composition and plant dry weight. In chamomile plants, (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-dendrolasin was detected in the oil of noninfested plants, and 1,4-dimethyl-7-(1-methylethyl)-azulen-2-ol was detected only in the oil of infested plants.">

The antiviral activity was determined using a plaque reduction assay against three common viruses namely, herpes simplex type-1 (HSV-1), hepatitis A (HAV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). The antimicrobial activity was assessed using agar diffusion and microdilution methods and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were determined. In addition, the anti-mycobacterial evaluation was carried out using the Alamar blue assay and the effect against &lt;i&gt;Helicobacter pylori&lt;/i&gt; was investigated. The anti-trypanosomal activity was evaluated using the resazurin method. GC investigations revealed that camphor is the major constituent of both oils accounting for 36.69 and 14.56% in the essential oils from &lt;i&gt;C. indicum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C. morifolium&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. &lt;i&gt;C. indicum&lt;/i&gt; was biologically more active in all experiments; it exhibited a notable antitrypanosomal activity with an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value equals 45.89 μg/mL and a notable antimicrobial activity versus &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus agalactiae&lt;/i&gt; with a MIC value of 62.5 μg/mL. It also inhibited the replication of VSV with an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 3.14 μg/mL. Both oils revealed antioxidant potential with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 2.21 and 2.59 mg/mL for &lt;i&gt;C. indicum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C. morifolium,&lt;/i&gt; respectively. This study provides evidence beyond the traditional use of both &lt;i&gt;Chrysanthemum indicum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C. morifolium&lt;/i&gt; as anti-infective agents. Thus they could be used as spices in food and can be incorporated in different food products and pharmaceutical preparations as natural preservatives possessing antioxidant potential.">

To our best knowledge, there are few studies on oregano grown in the arid Andes region, but none on the metabolites produced and their bioactivity. This work identified fifty metabolites by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS)-monoterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated monoterpenes, phenolic monoterpenes, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, and oxygenated sesquiterpenes-present in the essential oil of oregano collected in the Atacama Desert. The main components of essential oregano oil were thymol (15.9%), &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-sabinene hydrate (13.4%), γ-terpinene (10.6%), &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-cymene (8.6%), linalyl acetate (7.2%), sabinene (6.5%), and carvacrol methyl ether (5.6%). The antibacterial tests showed that the pathogenic bacteria &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt; and the phytopathogenic bacteria &lt;i&gt;Erwinia rhapontici&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Xanthomonas campestris&lt;/i&gt; were the most susceptible to oregano oil, with the lowest concentrations of oil necessary to inhibit their bacterial growth. Moreover, oregano oil showed antibacterial activity against bacteria associated with food poisoning.

        <span class="abst" title="Thymus albicans is an endemic species of the Iberian Peninsula with a vulnerable conservation status. In an attempt to contribute to the valorization of this species, the present study brings new insights on the antifungal and anti-inflammatory mechanism of action of T. albicans essential oil. The antifungal activity of the oil and its major compounds was assessed for the first time against standard and clinically isolated strains of yeasts and filamentous fungi. The effect on the two major virulence factors of Candida albicans (germ tube formation and biofilm disruption) was considered in more detail. At 0.08 μL/mL, the oil inhibited C. albicans germ tube formation by more than 40% and decreased biofilm biomass at MIC values, thus pointing out its antivirulent potential. The anti-inflammatory activity of the essential oil was investigated on LPS-stimulated mouse macrophages (RAW 264.7) by evaluating the levels of several pro-inflammatory mediators, namely nitric oxide (NO), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). T. albicans oil reduced the production of nitrites, a NO derived sub-product, at non-cytotoxic concentrations of 0.32 and 0.64 μL/mL, by 27 and 41%, respectively. In addition, the iNOS protein levels of essential oil pre-treated cells were reduced by 14%. Overall, the high essential oil yield of T. albicans as well as its bioactive effects at concentrations without cytotoxicity, encourage further studies on the potential pharmacological applications of this species. Furthermore, these results raise awareness for the need to preserve endangered species that may hold relevant medicinal value.">

CKEO, in comparison to its major constituent, geraniol, showed better MICs against tested pathogens. In combination studies, the effective concentrations of CKEO and streptomycin were reduced from 20 to 5 μg/mL and 11 to 0.7 ng/mL against E. coli. This suggests their synergistic action. However, CKEO showed partial synergy with ciprofloxacin. To understand the efficacy of CKEO, time-kill kinetics was performed. CKEO took the half time to show the bactericidal effect in comparison to streptomycin at their 2x MICs (double the MIC), while their combination took only 30 min for this. Fluorescence and surface electron microscopic and protein estimation studies suggested the multi-target action of CKEO-streptomycin combination against E. coli. Further, CKEO alone/in combination exhibited less than 10% haemolytic activity at its MIC.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;These results indicate that CKEO is a potentially safe alternative for the treatment of various pathogenic bacterial strains. It could be used for a variety of applications including human health, food storage, aquaculture, etc.">

To explore their potential, it is important to bring these remedies out of historical treatises, and into present-day scientific evaluation. Using an example of Indian traditional medicine (Ayurveda), we present a perspective toward evaluating historical remedies for anti-biofilm potential. Across compendia, we identified three plant-based remedies (of &lt;i&gt;Kalanchoe pinnata&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cynodon dactylon&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Ocimum tenuiflorum&lt;/i&gt;) recommended for wounds. The remedies were reconstituted in accordance with historical practices, and tested for their effects on biofilm formation and eradication assays of wound pathogens, &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;. Based on our approach and the results obtained, we provide insights into the considerations and challenges related to identifying potential remedies in historical texts, and testing them in the laboratory with standard biofilm assays. We believe this will be relevant for future studies exploring anti-biofilm approaches at the interface of historical medicine and present-day scientific practices.">

        <span class="abst" title="Little is known about the pharmacological activity of &lt;i&gt;Monarda fistulosa&lt;/i&gt; L. essential oils. To address this issue, we isolated essential oils from the flowers and leaves of &lt;i&gt;M. fistulosa&lt;/i&gt; and analyzed their chemical composition. We also analyzed the pharmacological effects of &lt;i&gt;M. fistulosa&lt;/i&gt; essential oils on transient receptor potential (TRP) channel activity, as these channels are known targets of various essential oil constituents. Flower (MEO&lt;sub&gt;Fl&lt;/sub&gt;) and leaf (MEO&lt;sub&gt;Lv&lt;/sub&gt;) essential oils were comprised mainly of monoterpenes (43.1% and 21.1%) and oxygenated monoterpenes (54.8% and 77.7%), respectively, with a high abundance of monoterpene hydrocarbons, including &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-cymene, γ-terpinene, α-terpinene, and α-thujene. Major oxygenated monoterpenes of MEO&lt;sub&gt;Fl&lt;/sub&gt; and MEO&lt;sub&gt;Lv&lt;/sub&gt; included carvacrol and thymol. Both MEO&lt;sub&gt;Fl&lt;/sub&gt; and MEO&lt;sub&gt;Lv&lt;/sub&gt; stimulated a transient increase in intracellular free Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration ([Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) in TRPA1 but not in TRPV1 or TRPV4-transfected cells, with MEO&lt;sub&gt;Lv&lt;/sub&gt; being much more effective than MEO&lt;sub&gt;Fl&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, the pure monoterpenes carvacrol, thymol, and β-myrcene activated TRPA1 but not the TRPV1 or TRPV4 channels, suggesting that these compounds represented the TRPA1-activating components of &lt;i&gt;M. fistulosa&lt;/i&gt; essential oils. The transient increase in [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; induced by MEO&lt;sub&gt;Fl&lt;/sub&gt;/MEO&lt;sub&gt;Lv&lt;/sub&gt;, carvacrol, β-myrcene, and thymol in TRPA1-transfected cells was blocked by a selective TRPA1 antagonist, HC-030031. Although carvacrol and thymol have been reported previously to activate the TRPA1 channels, this is the first report to show that β-myrcene is also a TRPA1 channel agonist. Finally, molecular modeling studies showed a substantial similarity between the docking poses of carvacrol, thymol, and β-myrcene in the binding site of human TRPA1. Thus, our results provide a cellular and molecular basis to explain at least part of the therapeutic properties of these essential oils, laying the foundation for prospective pharmacological studies involving TRP ion channels.">

The results obtained were assessed by principal component analysis (PCA). PCA distinguished six groups characterized by different terpene chemotypes. Amongst the EOs studied, the clove EO showed the strongest antioxidant activity characterized by an EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.36 µL/mL. The oregano EO had the greatest antiyeast activity characterized by a minimal inhibitory concentration of 10 µL/mL.

Essential oils (EOs) are an important class of secondary compounds with various biological activities, including allelopathic and antimicrobial activities. Herein, the present study aimed to compare the chemical profiles of the EOs of the widely distributed medicinal plant &lt;i&gt;Calotropis procera&lt;/i&gt; collected from Saudi Arabia and Egypt. In addition, this study also aimed to assess their allelopathic and antimicrobial activities. The EOs from Egyptian and Saudi ecospecies were extracted by hydrodistillation and analyzed via GC-MS. The correlation between the analyzed EOs and those published from Egypt, India, and Nigeria was assessed by principal component analysis (PCA) and agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC). The allelopathic activity of the extracted EOs was tested against two weeds (&lt;i&gt;Bidens pilosa&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dactyloctenium aegyptium&lt;/i&gt;). Moreover, the EOs were tested for antimicrobial activity against seven bacterial and two fungal strains. Ninety compounds were identified from both ecospecies, where 76 compounds were recorded in Saudi ecospecies and 33 in the Egyptian one. Terpenes were recorded as the main components along with hydrocarbons, aromatics, and carotenoids. The sesquiterpenes (54.07%) were the most abundant component of EO of the Saudi sample, while the diterpenes (44.82%) represented the mains of the Egyptian one. Hinesol (13.50%), &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-chrysanthenyl acetate (12.33%), 1,4-&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-1,7-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-acorenone (7.62%), phytol (8.73%), and myristicin (6.13%) were found as the major constituents of EO of the Saudi sample, while phytol (38.02%), &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-docosane (6.86%), linoleic acid (6.36%), &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-pentacosane (6.31%), and bicyclogermacrene (4.37%) represented the main compounds of the Egyptian one. It was evident that the EOs of both ecospecies had potent phytotoxic activity against the two tested weeds, while the EO of the Egyptian ecospecies was more effective, particularly on the weed &lt;i&gt;D. aegyptium&lt;/i&gt;. Moreover, the EOs showed substantial antibacterial and antifungal activities. The present study revealed that the EOs of Egyptian and Saudi ecospecies were different in quality and quantity, which could be attributed to the variant environmental and climatic conditions. The EOs of both ecospecies showed significant allelopathic and antimicrobial activity; therefore, these EOs could be considered as potential green eco-friendly resources for weed and microbe control, considering that this plant is widely grown in arid habitats.">

The &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; antiproliferative effects of TCEO on A549, HepG2, MCF-7 cancer cells, and HUVEC non-tumor cells was investigated using an MTT assay. Flow cytometry analysis was conducted to evaluate cell cycle distribution using propidium iodide staining, and cell death mode using Annexin V-FITC/PI assays. The expression of some apoptosis related genes was investigated using qRT-PCR. Major constituents of TCEO included fenchol, borneol, 3-cyclohexene-1-methanol and 3-ethyl-3-methyl. Cell viability test showed that TCEO is highly effective against MCF-7 cells with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 12.5 µg/mL. Cell cycle arrest at the G1/S phase, and apoptosis mediation were evident in the presence of TCEO. Gene expression analysis of several pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes revealed the initiation of apoptosis in TCEO-MCF-7 cells.

However, there are no clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy of the herbs mentioned in the treatment of functional dyspepsia (FD). This study was designed to appraise the efficacy and safety of a novel herbal medicine consisting of ZM, AG, and TA essential oils compared to omeprazole in FD treatment.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;The present study was a randomized double-blind clinical trial with parallel groups in Iran. Patients in control and intervention arms received omeprazole 20 mg once a day and 250 mg soft-gel capsules containing 180 mg of essential oils of ZM, AG, and TA twice a day for two weeks, respectively. The primary outcome was the sufficient response rate in the postprandial distress syndrome (PDS) and/or epigastric pain syndrome (EPS) at the end of the intervention. Secondary outcomes were the improvement rate in the PDS, EPS, Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS), and quality of life scores. Also, safety and tolerability were assessed.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The within-group comparison of EPS, PDS, total GSRS, GSRS Pain, and GSRS Dyspepsia scores with that at the end of the treatment indicated a significant reduction in both control and intervention groups (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.001). However, after two weeks of treatment, the herbal medication and omeprazole arms were significantly different in the sufficient response rate based on PDS (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.01) and EPS (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05) scores (78.3% (18/23) and 73.7% (14/19) in the intervention group &lt;i&gt;vs.&lt;/i&gt; 36.4% (8/22) and 40.9% (9/22) in the control group).

In the present experiment, the aerial parts of this plant were harvested at up to six different developmental stages during the growing season to determine the phytochemical profiles. Our results indicated that the highest essential oil content was obtained in the mid-mature seed stage (3.5%). The most elevated extract content was recorded in the floral budding stage (10.4%). In the vegetative stage, limonene (18.1%), in floral budding stage, caryophyllene (14.1%), anethole (14.6%), and β-bisabolene (12.7%), in the full flowering stage, myristicin (15.0%), and hexyl butyrate (9.1%), in the early development of seeds stage, hexyl butyrate (32.1%), and octyl acetate (11.7%), in the mid-mature seeds stage hexyl butyrate (38.8%), octyl acetate (14.5%), in the late-mature/ripe seeds stage, hexyl butyrate (23.6%), and octyl acetate (10.5%) are recorded as the main components. The highest phenolic acids content was obtained in the floral budding stage (287.40 mg/g dried extract). The analysis of phenolic acids demonstrated cinnamic acid (8.0-225.3 mg/g extract), p-coumaric acid (1.7-39.2 mg/g extract), p-hydroxybenzoic acid (0.8-16.8 mg/g extract), and ferulic acid (2.4-15.8 mg/g extract) as the main phenolic acids. Cinnamic acid was found as the major phenolic compound in the vegetative stage following by floral budding, the full flowering stage, the early development of seeds, and late-mature/ripe seeds stages. P-coumaric acid was the most abundant phenolic compounds in the mid-mature seeds stage. In this regard, the harvest time of &lt;i&gt;H. persicum&lt;/i&gt; aerial parts can be selected to achieve the highest secondary metabolites of interest. The results of this study can be used as a guideline for grower to obtain the highest possible amount of desirable metabolites, beneficial in both food and pharmaceutical industries as well as their undeniable economical benefits.">

Gum Arabic (GA) and maltodextrins (MD) were used as wall materials. The effects of several factors, including GA to MD ratio, total solids content of emulsion, wall to core ratio, and inlet air temperature, on the microencapsulation efficiency (ME) were investigated. The optimization of operation conditions was realized by response surface methodology (RSM). The optimal conditions were as follows: GA to MD ratio 2.38, total solids content 39%, wall to core ratio 5.33, and inlet air temperature 154°C. Under the optimal conditions, the ME of SBPO microcapsules was 94.96 ± 1.42%. The physicochemical properties of microcapsules were also invested. SBPO microcapsules obtained had low water activity, low moisture content, high water solubility, and high bulk density. For the morphological characteristics, cracks and pores were not observed in most microcapsules, which was beneficial for the protection of ingredients in microcapsules. The particle size of SBPO microcapsules ranged from 0.01 to 5 μm, and the mean diameter &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; &lt;sub&gt;4,3&lt;/sub&gt; was 2.55 μm. The analysis results of fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) informed the presence of SBPO in microcapsules. There were no significant differences in the content of the main fatty acids in SBPO before and after spray drying.

        <span class="abst" title="The roots, bark, and leaves of &lt;i&gt;Cinnamomum camphora&lt;/i&gt; are rich in essential oils, which mainly comprised monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. Although the essential oils obtained from &lt;i&gt;C. camphora&lt;/i&gt; have been widely used in pharmaceutical, medicinal, perfume, and food industries, the molecular mechanisms underlying terpenoid biosynthesis are poorly understood. To address this lack of knowledge, we performed transcriptome analysis to investigate the key regulatory genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis in &lt;i&gt;C. camphora&lt;/i&gt;. High-oil-yield trees of linalool type and low-oil-yield trees were used to assemble a &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; transcriptome of &lt;i&gt;C. camphora&lt;/i&gt;. A total of 121,285 unigenes were assembled, and the total length, average length, N50, and GC content of unigenes were 87,869,987, 724, 1,063, and 41.1%, respectively. Comparison of the transcriptome profiles of linalool-type &lt;i&gt;C. camphora&lt;/i&gt; with trees of low oil yield resulted in a total of 3,689 differentially expressed unigenes, among them 31 candidate genes had annotations associated with metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides, including four in the monoterpenoid biosynthesis pathway and three in the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway. Collectively, this genome-wide transcriptome provides a valuable tool for future identification of genes related to essential oil biosynthesis. Additionally, the identification of a cohort of genes in the biosynthetic pathways of terpenoids provides a theoretical basis for metabolic engineering of essential oils in &lt;i&gt;C. camphora&lt;/i&gt;.">

The elucidated factors affecting the composition of Mentha essential oils are fertilization, drying conditions, mechanical impedance, NaCl stress, and Gamma irradiation. Investigation of the activities of the Mentha species showed that the main interest was dedicated to addressing the antibacterial effect towards gram+ and gram- bacteria. Essential oils of Mentha species exhibited antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant, insecticidal, licidal, niticidal, allelopathic, antidiabetic, derma-protective, and anticorrosive activities. The ethnobotanical surveys revealed that Mentha species are used in seven regions: Tafilalet, High Atlas, Fez-Boulemane, Taounat, Oujda, Ouazzane, and Rabat. By calculating the Jaccard index, the highest degree of similarity was found between Tafilalet, Rabat, and Oujda regions. The wide use of the Mentha species in Morocco highlights the high ethnobotanical value of the genus.">

        <span class="abst" title="Plastic, usually derived from non-renewable sources, is among the most used materials in food packaging. Despite its barrier properties, plastic packaging has a recycling rate below the ideal and its accumulation in the environment leads to environmental issues. One of the solutions approached to minimize this impact is the development of food packaging materials made from polymers from renewable sources that, in addition to being biodegradable, can also be edible. Different biopolymers from agricultural renewable sources such as gelatin, whey protein, starch, chitosan, alginate and pectin, among other, have been analyzed for the development of biodegradable films. Moreover, these films can serve as vehicles for transporting bioactive compounds, extending their applicability as bioactive, edible, compostable and biodegradable films. Biopolymer films incorporated with plant-derived bioactive compounds have become an interesting area of research. The interaction between environment-friendly biopolymers and bioactive compounds improves functionality. In addition to interfering with thermal, mechanical and barrier properties of films, depending on the properties of the bioactive compounds, new characteristics are attributed to films, such as antimicrobial and antioxidant properties, color and innovative flavors. This review compiles information on agro-based biopolymers and plant-derived bioactive compounds used in the production of bioactive films. Particular emphasis has been given to the methods used for incorporating bioactive compounds from plant-derived into films and their influence on the functional properties of biopolymer films. Some limitations to be overcome for future advances are also briefly summarized. This review will benefit future prospects for exploring innovative methods of incorporating plant-derived bioactive compounds into films made from agricultural polymers.">

Spatial memory was assessed using the Y-maze test and novel object recognition test (NOR). Anxiety and depression were measured in the novel tank diving test (NTT). Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was used to study the phytochemical composition of TEO. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and oxidative stress response in the brain of zebrafish were determined. TEO ameliorated Sco-induced increasing of AChE activity, amnesia, anxiety, and reduced the brain antioxidant capacity.

This study examines the chemical constituents, antioxidant activity, and potential inhibitory effect against human peroxiredoxin 5, a key enzyme of &lt;i&gt;P. cubeba&lt;/i&gt; essential oil from fruits. Using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), the principal components were methyleugenol (41.31%) and eugenol (33.95%), followed by (E)-caryophyllene (5.65%), &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-cymene-8-ol (3.50%), 1,8-cineole (2.94%), and α-terpinolene (1.41%). Results showed similar scavenging activity via 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl DPPH radical scavenging activity (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 110.00 ± 0.08 μg/mL), as well as very potent antioxidant activity against both ferric reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP) (106.00 ± 0.11 μg/mL) and β-carotene bleaching (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 315.00 ± 2.08 μg/mL) assays when compared to positive butylated hydroxytoluene and ascorbic acid. The molecular docking approach has also been performed to screen the antioxidant activities of the major and potent compounds against human protein target peroxiredoxin 5. Results showed good binding profiles and attributed the strongest inhibitory activity to β-caryophyllene oxide (-5.8 kcal/mol), followed respectively by isocembrol and α-selinene (-5.4 kcal/mol), and viridiflorol (-5.1 kcal/mol). Furthermore, ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion)-related physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties have been assessed and support our in vitro findings. This work demonstrates the powerful antioxidant potency of cubeba pepper and paves the way for the discovery and development of antioxidant agent with high potency.">

In this study, the antiproliferative activity of &lt;i&gt;S. montana&lt;/i&gt; extracts obtained by supercritical carbon dioxide and solid-liquid extraction followed by spray drying was investigated using the in vivo model of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) in mice. The impact of two concentrations of extracts on the growth of tumor and the redox status of malignant cells was monitored. It was determined that the extracts induced oxidative stress in the malignant cells which was confirmed by the changes in activity of biochemical indicators of oxidative stress. The posttreatment was not an efficient approach, while the extracts applied as pretreatment and treatment resulted in an increase in the xanthine oxidase (XOD) activity, a decrease in catalase (CAT) activity, and an increase in the intensity of lipid peroxidation (LPx). Furthermore, a decrease in the values of reduced glutathione (GSH) and an increase in glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx) in EAC cells were recorded.">

The characteristic of the subspecies was undertaken in terms of selected morphological parameters and the quality of the raw material. The herb of both subspecies was evaluated on the content and composition of essential oil by hydrodistillation followed by GC-MS and GC-FID (gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry and flame ionization detector), the total content of phenolic acids (according to PP 6th ed.) and the content of rosmarinic acid (by HPLC). The sensory evaluation (QDA) was performed, as well. Greek oregano was distinguished by visibly higher number of glandular trichomes on the leaves (up to 4.85 per 1 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) followed by higher content of essential oil in the herb (up to 3.36 g × 100 g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW) in comparison to common oregano. Based on the essential oil composition, Greek oregano was classified as mixed carvacrol/γ-terpinene chemotype, while common oregano as mixed sabinyl/cymyl type rich in sesquiterpenes. Greek oregano was also characterized by higher total content of phenolic acids (up to 6.16 g × 100 g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW) and rosmarinic acid (up to 6787.2 mg × 100 g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW) than common oregano. Essential oil content reached the maximum at the beginning of blooming (common oregano) and at the full blooming stage (Greek oregano). In turn, the amount of phenolic acids followed by rosmarinic acid was the highest at the beginning of seed-setting stage, in the case of both subspecies. The differences between subspecies concerning chemical composition (especially essential oil) were reflected in the sensory attributes, where both odor and taste notes were found at higher level for Greek oregano. Results of our work indicate that Greek oregano is well adapted to grow in the temperate zone conditions. Such adaptation was reflected mainly in the satisfied yield and maintaining characters typical for the Mediterranean plant, e.g., a high essential oil content followed by high carvacrol share, traits the most important from practice viewpoint.">

Articles were found on quantitative and qualitative phytochemical studies of the &lt;i&gt;Cedrela&lt;/i&gt; species, revealing the chemical compounds identified, such as aliphatics acid and alcohol, flavonoids, tocopherol, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, triterpenes, cycloartanes, steroids, and limonoids. Although some activities were tested, the majority of studies focused on the insecticidal, antifeedant, or insect growth inhibitor activities of this genus. Nonetheless, the most promising activities were related to their antimalarial and antitripanocidal effects, although further investigations are still needed.">

The plant Curcuma wenyujin, which is grown primarily in Wenzhou, China, is considered the best source of Rhizoma Curcumae. In this study, we sought to ascertain differences in transcript profiles of C. wenyujin grown in traditional (Wenzhou) and recently established (Haikou) production areas based on Illumina and RNA (RNA-seq) sequencing. We also examined differences in the main components of the volatile oil terpene; curcumin, polysaccharide, and starch constituents and related genes in the corresponding pathways, in C. wenyujin cultivated in the two production areas. We accordingly found that the essential oil (2.05%), curcumin (1.46%), and polysaccharide (8.90%) content in Wenzhou rhizomes was higher than that in the rhizomes of plants from Haikou (1.60%, 0.91%, and 6.15%, respectively). In contrast, the starch content of Wenzhou rhizomes (17.0%) was lower than that of Haikou rhizomes (23.8%). Furthermore, we detected significant differences in the oil components of Haikou and Wenzhou rhizomes, with curzerene (32.34%), curdione (21.35%), and germacrene B (9.39%) being the primary components of the essential oil derived from Wenzhou rhizomes, and curzerene (20.13%), curdione (14.73%), and cineole (9.76%) being the main constituents in Haikou rhizomes. Transcriptome and qPCR analyses revealed considerable differences in gene expression between Wenzhou and Haikou rhizomes. The expression of terpene, curcumin, and polysaccharide pathway-related genes in Wenzhou rhizomes was significantly up-regulated, whereas the expression of starch-associated genes was significantly down-regulated, compared with those in Haikou rhizomes. Difference in the content of terpene, curcumin, polysaccharides, and starch in rhizomes from the two production areas could be explained in terms of differences in expression of the related genes.">

Kuntze (&lt;i&gt;Nepeta curviflora&lt;/i&gt;) is a medicinal herb growing in the eastern parts of the Mediterranean Sea Basin and is widely consumed as a tea. The leaves of this plant have been traditionally used for the treatment of various infectious diseases. The current research was designed to identify the chemical composition of &lt;i&gt;Glechoma curviflora&lt;/i&gt; (Boiss.) essential oil (EO) and to assess its antibacterial, antifungal, and cyclooxygenase inhibitory activities and the biophysical gating effect on AMPA receptors. Twenty phytochemicals were identified from &lt;i&gt;G. curviflora&lt;/i&gt; leaves and flowers EO amounting to almost 100% of the total constituents using GC-MS technique, of which 1,6-dimethylspiro[4.5]decane (27.51%) &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, caryophyllene oxide (20.08%) &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-caryophyllene (18.28%) &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; were the main constituents. The biophysical properties' effect from the plant extract on various AMPA-type receptors expressed in Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK293) cells was assessed by exploiting the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Microdilution assay was adopted for assessing the antimicrobial property against eight virulent microbial strains whilst the cyclooxygenase inhibition effect was accomplished utilizing COX inhibitory screening colorimetric assay &lt;i&gt;G. curviflora&lt;/i&gt; EO displayed potent activity against &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; (MIC = 1.25 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL), &lt;i&gt;S. sonnei&lt;/i&gt; (MIC = 3.12 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL), and &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; (MIC = 1.25 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL), compared with ciprofloxacin (positive control) and potent antibacterial activity against &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt;, MRSA, &lt;i&gt;S. sonnei&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; compared to Ampicillin (2nd positive control).

The essential oils were successfully screened and confirmed by HRLC-MS analysis. The anti-bacterial ability of the compounds were loaded into the chitosan nanoparticles and proved by FT-IR analysis. In addition, the chitosan loaded essential oils morphology was compared with chitosan alone in SEM analysis and suggested that the material was loaded successfully. Further, the anti-bacterial ability of the chitosan loaded essential oils were primarily confirmed by agar well diffusion method. At the 100 µg/mL of lowest concentration of chitosan loaded essential oils, the multi-drug resistant &lt;i&gt;K. pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; was inhibited with 96% and confirmed by minimum inhibition concentration experiment.

Phenol, flavonoid, and anthocyanin contents were examined before and after using column. Antioxidant activities, DNA protection ability, xanthine oxidase inhibition, and cytotoxicity of this fraction were also determined. The use of Amberlite increased phenol, flavonoid, and anthocyanin contents in fraction compared to the sample before fractionation. The IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of various antioxidant assays comprises 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate (DPPH), ferric-reducing antioxidant power assay (FRAP), and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) which were 226.66 ± 1.25, 126.03 ± 0.11, and 241.43 ± 0.33 for waste water, and these values for fraction were 63.21 ± 0.90, 34.6 ± 0.17, and 50.59 ± 0.75 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml, respectively. The Trolox equivalent values of fraction in oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay were 0.34 ± 0.04, and the EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values in cellular antioxidant activity were 91.24 ± 0.32 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml. The xanthine oxidase inhibition capacity of fraction (100 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml) was 96.4 ± 0.02% &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml. The comet assay analysis showed that this fraction (25-100 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml) protects human lymphocytes against H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced DNA damages significantly.

There has been great attention to the valorization of waste materials. Recovered fraction could be considered as a proper antioxidant, DNA damage-protection agent, and xanthine oxidase inhibitor. Using a nontoxic solid phase such as Amberlite is a fruitful way to concentrate bioactive ingredients which can be used in pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industry.">

The model is established based on the available chemical composition's information of a set of endemic Egyptian plants and their biological activities. Another type of machine learning algorithms, Multiclass Neural Network (MNN), has been applied on the same Essential Oils (EO) dataset. This aims to fairly evaluate the performance of the proposed CNN model. The recorded accuracy in the testing process for both CNN and MNN is 98.13% and 81.88%, respectively. Finally, the CNN technique has been adopted as a reliable model for classifying and predicting the bioactivities of the Egyptian EO-containing plants. The overall accuracy for the final prediction process is reported as approximately 97%. Hereby, the proposed deep learning model could be utilized as an efficient model in predicting the bioactivities of, at least Egyptian, EOs-producing plants.">

This composition drastically changes through the heating of the samples and causes significant changes in thermal behavior. The present study demonstrated that the concentration of carvacrol in S. hortensis essential oil is increasing after heating treatment, and the sample heated at 190 ºC for 2.5 h contained more than 91% carvacrol.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of Qodume Shirazi seed mucilage (QSSM) and lavender essential oil (LO) on the preservation of ostrich meat during cold storage. The chemical compounds of LO were identified through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The ostrich meat samples were coated with the mucilage containing the essential oil at concentrations of 0%, 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, and 2%, v/v. The control and the coated ostrich meat samples were kept at 4°C and analyzed for microbiological (total viable count, psychrotrophic count, &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, coliforms, and fungi), physicochemical (moisture content, pH, texture, and color parameters), and sensorial (odor, color, and total acceptance) characteristics during 9 days of storage. GC/MS identified 12 compounds in the essential oil, among which linalool was the major one (43.3%). The lightness (L* value) and hardness of all the ostrich meat samples were reduced during the storage. From a microbiological point of view, the cold storage duration for the control and the coated sample without the essential oil was only 3 days, while for coated samples containing 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, and 2% essential oil, it was 3, 3, 6, and 9 days, respectively. The coated ostrich meat containing 2% LO had an appropriate quality with an expanded shelf life. The results showed that neural network with 10 neurons in the hidden layer had the lowest mean squared error and mean absolute error and the highest correlation coefficient for predicting the quality and microbial properties of the coated meat samples during storage.">

The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry characterization revealed that thymol (1.2%-86.4%), carvacrol (3.2%-52.4%), gamma-terpinene (0.0%-12.7%), para-cymene (3.2%-5.2%), geraniol (0.0%-14.5%), and spathulenol (0.0%-13.6%) are the major constituents of the essential oils. Gelatin-pectin composite incorporated with the essential oils exhibited acidic pH (2.40-3.04), low conductivity (265-278 µS/cm), low surface tension (19.0-23.5 mN/m), low Newtonian viscosity (23.7-28.5 mPa.s), negative zeta-potential (14.2-16.9 mV), and nanoscale particle size (313-336 nm). These rheological properties result in the production of globular gelatin-pectin nanoparticles with a size range of 500-700 nm. The FTIR spectra of gelatin-pectin and gelatin-pectin-essential oils to some extent were similar, suggesting the noncovalent interactions between them. Gelatin-pectin composite incorporated with the essential oils displayed antiglucose oxidation (130-150 µg/ml) antilipid peroxidation (120-130 µg/ml), antiprotein oxidation (150-168 µg/ml), and antiprotein glycation (145-170 µg/ml) as well as antiamylase (216-230 µg/ml), and antiglucosidase (212-238 µg/ml) activity. The essential oils strongly improved the antioxidant capacity of the gelatin-pectin composite so strongly which can be recommended as a natural compound for oxidative stress management.">

        <span class="abst" title="A new coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged and with it, a global investigation of new antiviral treatments and supportive care for organ failure due to this life-threatening viral infection. Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM) is one of the most ancient medical doctrines mostly known with the manuscripts of Avicenna and Rhazes. In this paper, we first introduce a series of medicinal plants that would potentially be beneficial in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection according to TPM textbooks. Then, we review medicinal plants based on the pharmacological studies obtained from electronic databases and discuss their mechanism of action in SARS-CoV-2 infection. There are several medicinal plants in TPM with cardiotonic, kidney tonic, and pulmonary tonic activities, protecting the lung, heart, and kidney, the three main vulnerable organs in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Some medicinal plants can prevent &quot;humor infection&quot;, a situation described in TPM which has similar features to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pharmacological evaluations are in line with the therapeutic activities of several plants mentioned in TPM, mostly through antiviral, cytoprotective, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic mechanisms. Amongst the primarily-introduced medicinal plants from TPM, rhubarb, licorice, garlic, saffron, galangal, and clove are the most studied plants and represent candidates for clinical studies. The antiviral compounds isolated from these plants provide novel molecular structures to design new semisynthetic antiviral agents. Future clinical studies in healthy volunteers as well as patients suffering from pulmonary infections are necessary to confirm the safety and efficacy of these plants as complementary and integrative interventions in SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

The antioxidant assays followed ORAC, FRAP and TEAC tests. The antimicrobial activities of the extract and purified flavonoid were analysed against six multi-drug resistant microbial strains in broth dilution assays.&lt;h4&gt;Result&lt;/h4&gt;The results revealed that both the crude extracts and isolated 6-methyltectochrysin exhibited positive radical ion scavenging antioxidant potential, however the crude extract was about 6-fold more potent antioxidant than the purified 6-methyltectochrysin. The crude extract also showed strong antimicrobial activities against &lt;i&gt;Bacillus cereus&lt;/i&gt;, and even more potent antimicrobial agent than the reference ampicillin antibiotic against &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;pneumoniae.&lt;/i&gt; A higher resistance was observed for the tested Gram-negative strains than for the Gram-positive ones. 6-methyltectochrysin was generally inactive in the antimicrobial assays.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The crude methanolic extract showed significant bioactivity which validates the medicinal relevance of the plant.

Also, the synergistic/antagonistic effects, generated by the presence of the main chemical compounds, were studied in order to recommend a preparation with optimal antimicrobial activity. The obtained results underline the fact that the monocomponent emulsion ECEO shows antimicrobial activity, while EOEO and EBEO do not inhibit the development of the analyzed strains. In binary or tertiary emulsions E(BEO/CEO), E(CEO/OEO) and E(OEO/ BEO/CEO) the antimicrobial effect of clove oil is potentiated due to the synergism exerted by the chemical compounds of essential oils.">

Aiele resin had a higher yield (6.86%) of essential oil than Okoume (3.62%). Twenty-one compounds for Okoume and eighteen for Aiele essential oil were identified using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Gp-C-MS) technique. The main compounds identified in Okoume essential oil were benzenemethanol, α, α,4-trimethyl (28.85%), (+)-3-carene (3,7,7-trimethyl bicyclo[4.1.0]hept-3-ene) (17.93%), D-Limonene ((4R)-1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene) (19.36%). With regard to the Aiele essential oil, we identified (1R,4S)-1-methyl-4-propan-2-ylcyclohex-2-en-1-ol (26.64%), and 1-methyl-4-propan-2-ylcyclohex-2-en-1-ol (26.83%). Two strains of bacteria, &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, were used in antibacterial tests. &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; was found to be more sensitive to Okoume and Aiele essential oils, with a high inhibition zone ranging from 20 to 16 mm. In comparison, the inhibition zone ranged from 6 to 12 mm for &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;. An electronic nose (e-nose) combined with pattern analysis methods such as principal component analysis (PCA), discriminant function analysis (DFA), and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were used to discriminate the essential oil samples. In summary, the e-nose and GC-MS allowed the identification of bioactive compounds in the essential oil samples, which have a strong antimicrobial activity, with satisfactory results.">

In this work, the essential oils were extracted using hydrodistillation in Clevenger apparatus and analyzed by GC-MS to determine their composition. The antioxidant capacity (AC) was evaluated in vitro. The cytotoxicity was determined using cell line cultures both non tumoral and tumoral. The toxicity was determined using the nematode &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated against 52 bacteria using the agar disc diffusion method and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined. The principal compounds found in &lt;i&gt;C. alba&lt;/i&gt; essential oil (CA_EO) were α-terpineol (24.96%) and eucalyptol (21.63%) and were isazafrol (91.9%) in &lt;i&gt;L. sempervirens&lt;/i&gt; essential oil (LS_EO). Both EOs showed antioxidant capacity in vitro. Both EO showed antibacterial activity against bacteria using. LS_EO showed more inhibitory effect on these cell lines respect to CA_EO. Both EOs showed toxicity against the nematode &lt;i&gt;C.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; at 3.12-50 mg/mL. The essential oils of CA and LS have an important bioactive potential in their antioxidant, antibacterial and cytotoxicity activity. Both essential oils could possibly be used in the field of natural medicine, natural food preservation, cosmetics, sanitation and plaguicides among others.">

        <span class="abst" title="Phthorimaea operculella (Zeller) is a worldwide pest of potato. Plant-borne chemicals would be potential alternatives of synthetic chemical fumigants against P. operculella in the storage. Asari Radix et Rhizoma is derived from the dry roots and rhizomes of Asarum heterotropoides Fr. Schmidt var. mandshuricum, A. sieboldii Miq. var. seoulense, or A. sieboldii. In this study, fumigant toxicity and oviposition deterrent of volatile constituents from ARR, δ-3-carene, γ-terpinene, terpinolene, eucarvone, 3,5-dimethoxytoluene, and methyleugenol were tested against P. operculella. The preliminary verification of preventive and control effects of eucarvone, 3,5-dimethoxytoluene and methyleugenol on P. operculella was carried out by simulating warehouse experiments. The results indicated that the six compounds above had fumigation toxic effects on the adults and eggs of P. operculella. Among them, δ-3-carene, γ-terpinene, and terpinolene had weaker fumigation effects than those of eucarvone, 3,5-dimethoxytoluene, and methyleugenol. The LC50 values of eucarvone, 3,5-dimethoxytoluene, and methyleugenol against adult P. operculella were 1.01, 1.78, 1.51 mg/liter air, respectively. The LC50 values against egg P. operculella were 1.09, 0.55, 0.30 mg/liter air, respectively. The oviposition deterrent experiment showed that only methyleugenol (at 5 and 1 mg/ml) and eucarvone (5 mg/ml) had a substantial oviposition deterrent effect. The simulated warehouse experiment verified that methyleugenol, eucarvone, and 3,5-dimethoxytoluene protected potatoes from P. operculella and demonstrated that methyleugenol had the best preventive and control effects. It was concluded that methyleugenol was the active ingredient with the most potential in the volatiles from ARR on P. operculella control and merit further study as botanic fumigant.">

Therefore, it is not possible to achieve this without different processes and the use of various additives. In order to improve safety and extend the shelf life of food products, various synthetic preservatives have been widely utilized by the food industry to prevent growth of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms. On the other hand, consumers' preference to consume food products with natural additives induced food industries to use natural-based preservatives in their production. It has been observed that herbal extracts and their essential oils could be potentially considered as a replacement for chemical antimicrobials. Antimicrobial properties of plant essential oils are derived from some main bioactive components such as phenolic acids, terpenes, aldehydes, and flavonoids that are present in essential oils. Various mechanisms such as changing the fatty acid profile and structure of cell membranes and increasing the cell permeability as well as affecting membrane proteins and inhibition of functional properties of the cell wall are effective in antimicrobial activity of essential oils. Therefore, our objective is to revise the effect of various essential oils and their bioactive components against &lt;i&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; in meat and poultry products.">

The cultivation of medicinal and aromatic plants (MAP) using bio-elicitors has been advocated as genuine tool to sustainably assure higher quantity and quality EOs. Herein, a field trial and laboratory bioassays were undergone to decipher the impact of a local arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) inoculation on agro-morphological yield, EO output and differential suppression of common bean (&lt;i&gt;Phaseolus vulgaris&lt;/i&gt; L.) root rot incited by &lt;i&gt;Fusarium solani.&lt;/i&gt; The field experiment was laid out following a completely randomized block design (CRBD) with two treatments; non-inoculated control and AMF-inoculation in triplicates. The effects of the EOs were tested against mycelial growth, conidia and common bean seeds germination. Promising concentrations were thereafter assessed for their suppressive effect against &lt;i&gt;Fusariun solani in planta&lt;/i&gt;. A significantly higher collar diameter, hypocotyl branching and subsequent Mycorrhizal Dependency (MD) in mycorrhizal lemongrass [(+)AMF] compared to non-inoculated counterpart [(-)AMF]. The resulting EOs consistently repressed &lt;i&gt;F. solani&lt;/i&gt; Fs4 conidia germination and mycelium deployment in a dose-dependent manner, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 500 ppm for both the EOs, and 125 ppm for the reference fungicide (Ridomil Plus 44 WP). The EO from mycorrhizal lemongrass protected the common bean plantlets from infection by &lt;i&gt;F. solani&lt;/i&gt; Fs4 both in laboratory and greenhouse conditions, leading to healthier and vigorous plantlets. The best protection rate was once more obtained with EO from AMF-primed lemongrass at the concentration of 1000 ppm (65.0%) while the lowest disease severity was obtained with Ridomil Plus 44 WP (63.13%). Overall, AMF inoculation shifted the lemongrass biochemical processes with subsequent impact on growth, and an enhanced suppression in Fusarium root rot under greenhouse conditions.">

In the present investigation, the essential oil of fruits from &lt;i&gt;Dacryodes peruviana&lt;/i&gt; collected in the Ecuadorian Amazon was extracted and studied. The essential oil was released from the plant matrix and isolated by hydrodistillation. The yields obtained were 4.8 ± 0.2% and 11.3 ± 0.2% for fresh and dried fruits, respectively, one of the highest yields on record to date. Twenty-five chemical compounds were identified by GC/MS and GC/FID techniques. The principal constituent was α-phellandrene, with 50.32 ± 3.32%. The antimicrobial activity of the oil was assayed against five Gram negative bacteria, two Gram positive bacteria and two fungi. The essential oil exerted a moderate activity against &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;. The repellent activity of the oil was assayed against mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae); the samples with 3%, 2% and 1% essential oil were class 4, and the sample with 0.5% showed to be class 3. The essential oil showed a weak antioxidant activity through the DPPH and ABTS methods.">

The chemical compositions of selected EOs were analyzed by gas chromatography. Carvacrol was the major component of SOO. The dominant active component of SMO was 1,8-cineole, while the major constituent in CO was linalool. The study shows that essential oils in combination, namely SOO + SMO and SOO + CO in a ¼ MIC + ¼ MIC (Minimal Inhibitory Concentration), have a synergistic effect against &lt;i&gt;L. monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt;. The reduction of &lt;i&gt;L. monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; in vegetable mixtures treated by EOs in these selected combinations after 24 h of storage was approximately equal to the limit of detection.

Volatile compounds produced by glandular trichomes (composed of one stalk cell and two elliptically formed head cells according to scanning electron microscope investigation) were isolated from the plants collected in two locations. Additionally, as a part of specialized metabolites, total polyphenols, total tannins, total flavonoids and total phenolic acids were determined spectrophotometrically. In the lipophilic volatile fractions-essential oils, the most abundant compounds identified were hexahydrofarnesyl acetone, caryophyllene oxide and hexadecanoic acid. In total, the class of oxygenated sesquiterpenes and the group of fatty aldehydes, acids and alcoholic compounds dominated in the essential oils. In the hydrophilic volatile fractions-hydrosols, the most abundant compounds identified were &lt;i&gt;trans-p-&lt;/i&gt;mentha-1(7),8-dien-2-ol, &lt;i&gt;allo&lt;/i&gt;-aromadendrene and &lt;i&gt;(E)-&lt;/i&gt;caryophyllene. A group of oxygenated monoterpenes and the sesquiterpene hydrocarbons dominated in the hydrosols. Antioxidant activity of essential oils and hydrosols was tested with two methods: 2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC). Essential oils showed higher antioxidant activity than hydrosols and showed similar antioxidant activity to &lt;i&gt;Rosmarinus officinalis&lt;/i&gt; essential oil. Obtained results demonstrate that this genus is a potential source of volatiles with antioxidant activity.">

The films were produced by the casting technique and characterized in relation to physical, chemical, structural, and antimicrobial activity. Sesquiterpenes, mainly β-caryophyllene, were the predominant compounds in copaiba oil, showing antimicrobial activity against &lt;i&gt;B. subtilis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt;. The films showed forming capacity, however, was observed a decrease in solubility and revealed an increase in hydrophobic characteristics. However, the oil reduced the tensile strength and elongation, while the microcapsules did not influence the mechanical properties in comparison to the control film. From microstructure analysis, changes in the films roughness and surface were observed after the addition of oil both directly and in microencapsulated form. Films incorporated with microparticles were able to inhibit the gram-positive bacteria tested, forming inhibition zones, indicating that the encapsulation of copaiba oil was more efficient for protecting bioactive compounds from the oil, suggesting the possible application of mangarito starch-based films incorporated with copaiba oil as biodegradable packaging.">

Its main chemical constituents are flavonoids (mainly derived from quercetin and kaempferol), C6-C1 and C6-C3 compounds, terpenes (mostly from the essential oil), and a large number of saponin molecules (mainly virgaureasaponins and solidagosaponins). Published research on its potential activities is critically reviewed here: antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, spasmolitic, antihypertensive, diuretic, antibacterial, antifungal, antiparasite, cytotoxic and antitumor, antimutagenic, antiadipogenic, antidiabetic, cardioprotective, and antisenescence. The evidence concerning its potential benefits is mainly derived from non-clinical studies, some effects are rather modest, whereas others are more promising, but need more confirmation in both non-clinical models and clinical trials.">

The objective of our research was a comparative study, in the Mediterranean context, of chemical composition, anticholinesterases, and antioxidant properties of essential oils (EOs) from sage collected in three areas (S1-S3) of Southern Italy. EOs were extracted by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitory properties were investigated by employing Ellman's method. Four in vitro assays, namely, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), ferric-reducing ability power (FRAP), and β-carotene bleaching tests, were used to study the antioxidant effects. Camphor (16.16-18.92%), 1,8-cineole (8.80-9.86%), β-pinene (3.08-9.14%), camphene (6.27-8.08%), and α-thujone (1.17-9.26%) are identified as the most abundant constituents. However, the content of these constituents varied depending on environmental factors and pedoclimatic conditions. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed. Based on Relative Antioxidant Capacity Index (RACI), S2 essential oil exhibited the highest radical potential with an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 20.64 μg/mL in ABTS test and presented the highest protection of lipid peroxidation with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 38.06 and 46.32 μg/mL after 30 and 60 min of incubation, respectively. The most promising inhibitory activity against BChE was found for S3 sample (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 33.13 μg/mL).">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Laggera tomentosa&lt;/i&gt; Sch. Bip. ex Oliv. et Hiern (Asteraceae), an endemic Ethiopian medicinal plant, is traditionally used to treat various ailments. Previously, the chemical constituents of the essential oil (EO) of its leaves and inflorescence were documented. However, no data about the chemical compositions of other parts of the EOs of the plant have been reported to date. Moreover, there are no previous biological activity reports on any parts of the EOs of this plant. Thus, in this study, the EOs were isolated from the stem bark and roots of this plant by hydrodistillation and analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify their components. In addition, antibacterial potentials of the oils were evaluated using the disc diffusion and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) methods. 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and hydrogen peroxide methods were also employed to assess their antioxidant properties. Oxygenated monoterpenes (71.82% and 77.51%), of which 2,5-dimethoxy- &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; -cymene (57.28% and 64.76%) and thymol methyl ether (9.51% and 8.93%) were identified as major components in the EOs of stem bark and roots of &lt;i&gt;L. tomentosa&lt;/i&gt; and the oils, were the most potent in the DPPH (IC50, 0.33 ± 1.10 and 0.39 ± 0.97 mg/mL) assay, respectively. Moreover, the EOs demonstrated appreciable activity towards the gram+ ( &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B. cereus&lt;/i&gt; ) bacteria. Among these oils, the oil of the stem bark showed the greatest activity to the gram+ (MIC = 0.625 mg/mL) bacteria. Therefore, the overall results suggested that the EOs of &lt;i&gt;L. tomentosa&lt;/i&gt; may be a promising prospect for pharmaceutical, food, and other industrial applications.">

These by-products of oxygen metabolism play a key role in the development of various human diseases such as cancer, diabetes, heart failure, brain damage, muscle problems, premature aging, eye injuries, and a weakened immune system. Synthetic and natural antioxidants, which act as free radical scavengers, are widely used in the food and beverage industries. The toxicity and carcinogenic effects of some synthetic antioxidants have generated interest in natural alternatives, especially plant-derived polyphenols (e.g., phenolic acids, flavonoids, stilbenes, tannins, coumarins, lignins, lignans, quinines, curcuminoids, chalcones, and essential oil terpenoids). This review focuses on the well-known phenolic antioxidant rosmarinic acid (RA), an ester of caffeic acid and (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-(+)-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl) lactic acid, describing its wide distribution in thirty-nine plant families and the potential productivity of plant sources. A botanical and phytochemical description is provided of a new rich source of RA, &lt;i&gt;Satureja khuzistanica&lt;/i&gt; Jamzad (Lamiaceae).

        <span class="abst" title="Impetigo (school sores) is a common superficial bacterial skin infection affecting around 162 million children worldwide, with the highest burden in Australian Aboriginal children. While impetigo itself is treatable, if left untreated, it can lead to life-threatening conditions, such as chronic heart and kidney diseases. Topical antibiotics are often considered the treatment of choice for impetigo, but the clinical efficacy of these treatments is declining at an alarming rate due to the rapid emergence and spread of resistant bacteria. In remote settings in Australia, topical antibiotics are no longer used for impetigo due to the troubling rise of antimicrobial resistance, demanding the use of oral and injectable antibiotic therapies. However, widespread use of these agents not only contributes to existing resistance, but also associated with adverse consequences for individuals and communities. These underscore the urgent need to reinvigorate the antibiotic discovery and alternative impetigo therapies in these settings. This review discusses the current impetigo treatment challenges in endemic settings in Australia and explores potential alternative antimicrobial therapies. The goals are to promote intensified research programs to facilitate effective use of currently available treatments, as well as developing new alternatives for impetigo.">

Antioxidant activity was assayed in methanol-acetone extracts and infusions of dried leaves with the use of free radical scavenging activity (DPPH) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) technique. Total phenolic content in extracts as well as in infusions was determined by the means of Folin-Ciocalteu method. Based on the LC/MS analysis, the polyphenol compounds present in both extracts and in infusions were identified. The extracts contained more polyphenols and were characterized by higher antioxidant activity than infusions. In the extracts significant amount of ferulic acid was found, which was influenced both by the harvest period and drying method. The amount of ferulic acid found in extracts obtained from the June leaves dried traditionally was three times lower (6.185 μg/g DW) than in extracts from July leaves dried in the same conditions. Harvest period had a significant effect on the essential oils' content, leaves collected in July contained 15% more oils than those collected in June.">

Information regarding the medical and scientific uses given to mints throughout history are vastly scattered and/or incomplete. The aim of this paper is to provide an extensive descriptive overview of the medical uses given to these herbs, highlighting both the authors in medical culture responsible for their dissemination, as well as their major galenic formulations. Databases on medical science, reference textbooks on medical history, botanics (aromatic herbs), and pharmacognosy were consulted. The use of mints remotes to Classical Antiquity, with major contributions from Pliny the Elder. In the Middle Ages, the increased knowledge surrounding mints came from Byzantine physicians, while, in the Modern Age, technological developments allowed the production of mint-based products which have become part of elaborate galenic formulas employed by an increasing number of physicians, as well as have also stimulated both scientific and artistic interests alike. In present-day medicine, several mints and mint-based products are being researched as potential therapeutic alternatives for many diseases, while also being vastly employed in food and cosmetic industries.">

        <span class="abst" title="Recently, increasing public concern about hygiene has been driving many studies to investigate antimicrobial and antiviral agents. However, the use of any antimicrobial agents must be limited due to their possible toxic or harmful effects. In recent years, due to previous antibiotics' lesser side effects, the use of herbal materials instead of synthetic or chemical drugs is increasing. Herbal materials are found in medicines. Herbs can be used in the form of plant extracts or as their active components. Furthermore, most of the world's populations used herbal materials due to their strong antimicrobial properties and primary healthcare benefits. For example, herbs are an excellent material to replace nanosilver as an antibiotic and antiviral agent. The use of nanosilver involves an ROS-mediated mechanism that might lead to oxidative stress-related cancer, cytotoxicity, and heart diseases. Oxidative stress further leads to increased ROS production and also delays the cellular processes involved in wound healing. Therefore, existing antibiotic drugs can be replaced with biomaterials such as herbal medicine with high antimicrobial, antiviral, and antioxidant activity. This review paper highlights the antibacterial, antiviral, and radical scavenger (antioxidant) properties of herbal materials. Antimicrobial activity, radical scavenger ability, the potential for antimicrobial, antiviral, and anticancer agents, and efficacy in eliminating bacteria and viruses and scavenging free radicals in herbal materials are discussed in this review. The presented herbal antimicrobial agents in this review include clove, portulaca, tribulus, eryngium, cinnamon, turmeric, ginger, thyme, pennyroyal, mint, fennel, chamomile, burdock, eucalyptus, primrose, lemon balm, mallow, and garlic, which are all summarized.">

The association of natural products and nanotechnology is important to improve the antifungal potential of medicinal plants. We aimed to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo anti-&lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt; activity of unloaded (EO) and loaded (ME+EO) essential oil of &lt;i&gt;Cymbopogon nardus&lt;/i&gt; in the microemulsion (ME).&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;The chemical analysis of the EO was performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The ME and ME+EO were characterized by scattering, zeta potential, polarized light microscopy, rheological assays, mucoadhesiveness and transmission electronic microscopy. The in vitro antifungal activity of the EO and ME+EO were evaluated by microdilution technique. The toxicity of EO and ME+EO was analyzed on human cell line HaCat and using alternative model assay with &lt;i&gt;Artemia salina&lt;/i&gt;. The experimental in vivo VVC was performed in female mice (C57BL/6).&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The main compounds of the EO were found to be citronellal, geranial, geraniol, citronellol, and neral. The formulations exhibited suitable size, homogeneity, negative charge, isotropic behavior, highly organized structure, and pseudoplastic behavior, for vaginal application. TEM photomicrographs showed possible EO droplets inside the spherical structures. The EO, when loaded into the ME, exhibited an improvement in its antifungal action against &lt;i&gt;C. albicans&lt;/i&gt;. The EO was not toxic against brine shrimp nauplii. An in vivo VVC assay showed that the use of the ME significantly improved the action of the EO, since only the ME+EO promoted the eradication of the fungal vaginal infection on the third day of treatment.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The EO and ME+EO are promising alternatives for the control of fungal infections caused by &lt;i&gt;C. albicans&lt;/i&gt;, once the use of nanotechnology significantly improved the antifungal action of the EO, especially in an in vivo model of VVC.">

In this study, we investigated the anti-atherosclerotic activity of raw danshen root extract prepared using high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) at 550 MPa for 5 min and hot water extraction. This method was useful for elimination of bacteria from cultured danshen plants and for better extraction yield of active principles. The HHPtreated danshen extract (HDE) inhibited proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and induced autophagy that was assessed by LC3 conversion and p62 degradation. HDE suppressed foam cell formation in oxLDL-induced RAW264.7 macrophages; lysosomal activity simultaneously increased, measured by acridine orange staining. HDE also reduced atherosclerotic plaque development in vivo in apolipoprotein E knock-out (ApoE-/-) mice fed a high cholesterol diet. Taken together, these results indicated that HDE exhibited anti-atherosclerotic activity via autophagy induction. [BMB Reports 2020; 53(12): 652-657].">

The excellent anti-microbial activity and minimum biofilm inhibition concentration of the essential oils against &lt;i&gt;P. mirabilis&lt;/i&gt; was indicated at 200 µg/mL. The absence of viability and altered exopolysaccharide structure of treated cells were showed by biofilm metabolic assay and phenol-sulphuric acid method. The fluorescence differentiation of &lt;i&gt;P. mirabilis&lt;/i&gt; treated cells was showed with more damages by confocal laser scanning electron microscope. Further, more morphological changes of essential oils treated cells were differentiated from normal cells by scanning electron microscope.

The flora is determined by complex historical and environmental factors occurring since the Tertiary period. The originality of this sector is due to the presence of the argan tree (Argania spinosa (L.) Skeels), Moroccan gum (Acacia gummifera Willd), olive trees (Olea europaea L. subsp. maroccana (Greuter &amp; Burdet) P. Vargas &amp; al.), a thermophilic flora adapted to an arid climate with several endemic species. This flora constitutes the final barrier against the desert and is of environmental and socioeconomical interest. Leaves and fruits provide forage material, while wood is used for fuel. Argan fruits are collected for their oily constitutes and for nutritional, cosmetic, and medicinal properties. Additionally, many species of Argan ecosystems are used in medicine and cosmetics. Recognizing its ecological value and local economic importance, the Argan region was declared a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1998. Despite their biogeographical, historical, and socioeconomic value, vegetation structures in west-central Morocco are vulnerable and threatened by human activities. They exhibit high levels of degradation due to increasing clearance, overgrazing, and overexploitation.

The test was conducted in the microbiology laboratory of the &lt;i&gt;Universidad Nacional Federico Villarreal&lt;/i&gt;.

Cinnamon essential oil was obtained using the hydrodistillation method, subsequently the oil obtained was dehydrated with sodium sulfate and then filtered at 0.22 µm. Then the vials were stored at a temperature of 4°C. Finally, &lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 10231 was used as the biological material. Antifungal efficacy was measured by the Kirby-Bauer method (disk diffusion).&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;It was found that in the 24-h group the concentration that had the greatest antifungal effect was 100% EOC with a mean of 22.1 ± 11 mm; however, the lowest antifungal activity was seen in the 25% EOC with 17.9 ± 1.6 mm. On the contrary, in the 48-h group, it was shown that the highest antifungal efficacy was also observed in the 100% EOC with an average of 31.2 ± 3.2 mm, but the lowest antifungal activity was in the 25% EOC with 22.6 ± 1.7 mm.

Otherwise, on analysis of the results in different concentrations, the EOC showed a directly proportional antifungal effectiveness as the concentration against the strains of &lt;i&gt;C. albicans&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 10231 increased, compared to nystatin, suggesting its potential use as a possible attractive therapeutic alternative for the control of diseases caused by strains of &lt;i&gt;C. albicans&lt;/i&gt; resistant to nystatin.">

        <span class="abst" title="Patchouli (&quot;Guanghuoxiang&quot;) or scientifically known as Pogostemon cablin Benth, belonging to the family Lamiaceae, has been used in traditional Chinse medicine (TCM) since the time of the Eastern Han dynasty. In TCM theory, patchouli can treat colds, nausea, fever, headache, and diarrhea. Various bioactive compounds have been identified in patchouli, including terpenoids, phytosterols, flavonoids, organic acids, lignins, glycosides, alcohols, pyrone, and aldehydes. Among the numerous compounds, patchouli alcohol, β-patchoulene, patchoulene epoxide, pogostone, and pachypodol are of great importance. The pharmacological impacts of these compounds include anti-peptic ulcer effect, antimicrobial effect, anti-oxidative effect, anti-inflammatory effect, effect on ischemia/reperfusion injury, analgesic effect, antitumor effect, antidiabetic effect, anti-hypertensive effect, immunoregulatory effect, and others.For this review, we examined publications from the previous five years collected from PubMed, Web of Science, Springer, and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure databases. This review summarizes the recent progress in phytochemistry, pharmacology, and mechanisms of action and provides a reference for future studies focused on clinical applications of this important plant extract.">

Antibacterial activity was evaluated using the agar wells technique and vapour phase test. Analysis of the oils by GC/MS identified thirty-five components representing 67.5 to 100% of the total oils. Monoterpene hydrocarbons were the most prevalent compounds, followed by oxygenated monoterpenes. The content of the compounds varied according to the samples. The main components were Limonene, Piperitenone, Neral, Citral, Elemol, p-cymene, Transtagetone, and Artemisia ketone. Only one of the eleven samples contained Verbenone as the majority compound. In the vapour phase test, a single oil was the most effective against all the pathogens studied. The principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) of components of the selected EOs and inhibition zone diameter values of agar wells technique allowed us to identify a variability between the plants from the two provinces, but also intraspecific variability between sub-groups within a population. Each group of essential oils constituted a chemotype responsible for their bacterial inhibition capacity. The results presented here suggest that Angolan &lt;i&gt;Lippia multiflora&lt;/i&gt; Moldenke has antibacterial properties and could be a potential source of antimicrobial agents for the pharmaceutical and food industry.">

The essential oil (EO) from &lt;i&gt;R. beesianus&lt;/i&gt; rhizome has been used as an aromatic stomachic in China. The chemical composition and biological activities of EO from &lt;i&gt;R. beesianus&lt;/i&gt; rhizome were reported for the first time. Based on gas chromatography with flame ionization or mass selective detection (GC-FID/MS) results, the major constituents of EO were 1,8-cineole (47.6%), borneol (15.0%), methyleugenol (11.2%), and bornyl formate (7.6%). For bioactivities, EO showed a significant antibacterial activity against &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus faecalis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Proteus vulgaris&lt;/i&gt; with the diameter of the inhibition zone (DIZ) (8.66-10.56 mm), minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) (3.13-6.25 mg/mL), and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) (6.25-12.5 mg/mL). Moreover, EO (128 μg/mL) significantly inhibited the production of proinflammatory mediators nitric oxide (NO) (92.73 ± 1.50%) and cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (20.29 ± 0.17%) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (61.08 ± 0.13%) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 macrophages without any cytotoxic effect. Moreover, EO exhibited significant acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity (the concentration of the sample that affords a 50% inhibition in the assay (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) = 1.03 ± 0.18 mg/mL) and moderate α-glucosidase inhibition effect (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 11.60 ± 0.25 mg/mL). Thus, the EO could be regarded as a bioactive natural product and has a high exploitation potential in the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries.">

The fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) composition was analyzed using GC-MS and GC-FID. The anticancer activity associated with the oil was assessed against colon cancer cell lines (Caco-2 and HCT-116) and compared to its cytotoxicity on the human skin fibroblast. Multivariate analysis was used to determine relationship of the fatty acid composition with that of the anticancer activity.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The results demonstrated that fatty acid composition of &lt;i&gt;Citrullus colocynthis&lt;/i&gt; seed oil chiefly contains Linoleic acid, denoted as C18:2n6 (75%), followed by Palmitic acid C16:0 (8%), Stearic acid C18:0 (5%), and Oleic acid C18:1n9 (9%). It is demonstrated as an excellent source of essential fatty acids omega-6 (e.g., Linoleic acid), whereas omega-3 (e.g., α-Linolenic acid) and hydroxy polyunsaturated fatty acids are found at small level. Interestingly, the oil exhibited reasonable anticancer effects against colorectal cancer cell lines with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values varying between 4 and 7 mg/ml. The correlation test revealed a relationship between the fatty acid composition and the effectiveness on treatments.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Handal plant from Jordan appears to have very high level of Linoleic acid compared to other oils measured in different geographic locations and that there appears to be some anticancer activities associated with the fatty acid content of Handal seed oil.">

Although treatment options are readily available, most drugs often cause serious side effects. Extracts of &lt;i&gt;Dracocephalum kotschyi&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;D. kotschyi&lt;/i&gt;) have shown significant pharmacological activity against various parasites, viruses, and bacteria. In this study, we evaluated the anti-&lt;i&gt;T. gondii&lt;/i&gt; activity in vitro and in vivo of &lt;i&gt;D. kotschyi&lt;/i&gt; essential oil. The thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) method was used to assess the anti-&lt;i&gt;T. gondii&lt;/i&gt; activity and cytotoxicity of the essential oil. The presence of &lt;i&gt;T. gondii&lt;/i&gt; was observed by Giemsa staining, and the viability was evaluated by the trypan blue staining method. Furthermore, the survival rate of acutely infected mice was evaluated by intraperitoneal injecting of the essential oil (50, 100, and 200 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; day&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) for five days after infection with 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; tachyzoites. Essential oil, negative, and positive controls that showed the best toxoplasmacidal activity were assayed in triplicate at each concentration. The essential oil exhibited the highest anti-&lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/i&gt; activity with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) of 9.94 ± 0.38 µg, with a selectivity index of 2.463. On Vero cells, the CC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of the oil was 24.49 ± 0.96 µg and exhibited a significant anti-&lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/i&gt; activity. Moreover, the treatment by essential oil significantly increased the survival rate compared to untreated infected control. In conclusion, the essential oil might be a useful compound, and with more testing, it may be an excellent alternative to standard chemical drugs in the treatment of toxoplasmosis.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background and aim&lt;/h4&gt;As an alternative to natural and chemically synthesized direct-acting bactericides, there has been an increase in the use of plant extracts, which possess a set of phytochemicals with potential for microbial disease control; this is due to the spectrum of secondary metabolites present in extracts, which include phenolic compounds, quinones, flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, and polyacetylenes. The biologically active substances within plant extracts, which perform protective functions for plant tissues, can have ambiguous effects on the animal body. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the ability of gamma-octalactone, isolated from &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus viminalis&lt;/i&gt; extract, to inhibit various LuxI/LuxR quorum-sensing (QS) systems in bacteria, and to evaluate its effect on broiler chickens.&lt;h4&gt;Materials and methods&lt;/h4&gt;Phytochemical analysis of &lt;i&gt;E. viminalis&lt;/i&gt; extract was performed. The ability of gamma-octalactone to inhibit QS was evaluated using four different LuxI/LuxR bacterial test systems. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; assessments were performed on one hundred and twenty 7-day-old broiler chickens (Arbor Acres cross), split into four groups of 30 chickens: 1. Control group: Basic diet (BD); 2. experimental Group I: BD + gamma-octalactone at a dosage of 0.05 ml/kg live weight/day; 3. experimental Group II: BD + gamma-octalactone at a dosage of 0.1 ml/kg live weight/day; and 4. experimental Group III: BD + gamma-octalactone at a dosage of 0.2 ml/kg live weight/day. Hematological blood parameters were assessed using an automatic hematological analyzer (URIT-2900 Vet Plus, URIT Medial Electronic Co., China) and an automatic biochemical analyzer (CS-T240, Dirui Industrial Co., Ltd., China). Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics Version 20 (IBM); averages (M), standard deviations (σ), and standard deviation errors (m) were calculated. Results with p≤0.05 were considered significant.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Based on the phytochemical analysis results, libraries of compounds with putative QS inhibitory properties were compiled. Gamma-octalactone exhibited a pronounced inhibitory effect on the LuxI/LuxR QS systems, characterized by EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 0.15-0.4 mM. In the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; portion of this study, broiler chicken live weights increased in all experimental groups, with the most significant increase in Group III (14.0%), in relation to the control group. Blood serum from the experimental group chickens had significantly higher levels of triglycerides and uric acid (p≤0.05), in comparison to the control group chickens. With respect to blood serum enzyme activity and antioxidant status indicators, the experimental group chickens had a higher level of gamma-glutamyl transferase, an enzyme associated with amino acid metabolism, than those in the control group; this increase was especially pronounced in Group III, with 37.0% increase (p≤0.05). Superoxide dismutase and catalase levels were higher in the experimental groups than the control group, corresponding to increases of 30.4-56.2% (p≤0.05), 33.3-83.3%, and 27.9-45.5% (p≤0.05) in Groups I, II, and III (p≤0.05), respectively. Morphological blood parameters did not display significant changes due to gamma-octalactone.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;According to the results of this &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; study in broiler chickens, gamma-octalactone, isolated from &lt;i&gt;E. viminalis&lt;/i&gt; leaf extract and supplied at a dosage of 0.2 ml/kg live weight/day, led to an increase in the activity of blood plasma digestive enzymes, increased live weight, and had a positive effect on lipid metabolism and antioxidant status.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;Leishmaniasis is a group of diseases caused by protozoan parasites, which remains a burden for developing countries. The lack of a vaccine as well as the emergence of resistance toward the recommended drugs pose a challenge for the control of the disease. This urges the demand for new antileishmanial agents to prevent and treat this disease. Consequently, four Ethiopian plants were selected and tested for their antileishmanial activity against two Leishmanial parasites.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Methanol (80%) was used to macerate the plant materials. In vitro antipromastigote activity of the crude extracts was then tested against promastigotes and axenically cultured amastigotes of &lt;i&gt;Leishmania aethiopica&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Leishmania donovani&lt;/i&gt; clinical isolates using Alamar Blue assay, and cell viability was measured fluorometrically. 1% DMSO and the media were used as a negative control while amphotericin B was used as a positive control. Furthermore, preliminary phytochemical analysis of the extracts was performed.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;From the four plants' extracts, &lt;i&gt;Ferula communis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Otostegia integrifolia&lt;/i&gt; showed better activity with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 11.38±0.55 and 13.03±0.87 µg/mL against &lt;i&gt;L. aethiopica&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. However, the same plant extracts exhibited lower activity against &lt;i&gt;L. donovani&lt;/i&gt; with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 23.41±2.32 and 17.24±1.29 µg/mL, respectively. &lt;i&gt;O. integrifolia&lt;/i&gt; exhibited highest effect against amastigotes of &lt;i&gt;L. aethiopica&lt;/i&gt; (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;: 16.84±0.65) and &lt;i&gt;L. donovani&lt;/i&gt; (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;:14.55±0.38). &lt;i&gt;F. communis&lt;/i&gt; resulted second highest in growth inhibition against amastigotes of &lt;i&gt;L. aethiopica&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;L. donovani&lt;/i&gt; with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 14.32±0.54 and 31.12±0.19, respectively. The phytochemical analysis of the extracts indicated the presence of phenol, flavonoids, tannins, saponins, terpenoids, and alkaloids.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The findings from this study demonstrate that crude extracts of &lt;i&gt;F. communis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;O. integrifolia&lt;/i&gt; showed promising antileishmanial activity against &lt;i&gt;L. aethiopica&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;L. donovani&lt;/i&gt; that may be attributed to the presence of different secondary metabolites.">

In this study, the effectiveness of three concentrations of either thyme oil (300,400 and 500 mg/l) or clove oil (150,250 and 500 mg/l) as additives in holding the postharvest solutions of chrysanthemum ''Arctic Queen White'' cut flowers were investigated. The experiments were carried out as a completely randomized design in three replicates. Many postharvest characteristics have been evaluated, such as the vase life of cut flowers, diameters of head flowers and stem, dry matter of flowers, total vase water uptake, total loss of water, relative fresh weight. Additionally, the chlorophyll contents, total sugar, and bacterial counts were determined. The results showed that the longest vase life of cut chrysanthemum was 36.50, 33.40 days, and 35.88, 31.33 days by addition of either the thyme oil (500 mg/l) or clove oil (250 mg/l) in holding solution as compared with distilled water (18.09 and 17.22 days) in both seasons. The highest total vase water uptake and relative fresh weight were (225.00, 211.05 g/flower/day) and (79.89, 70.37 %) of cut chrysanthemum treated with 500 mg/l thyme oil in both seasons. Whereas the lowest total water loss in the two seasons was 155.11 and 156.60 g/flower/day was found with 400 mg/l thyme oil. The greatest chlorophyll a, b, carotenoids, and total sugar contents obtained from treated cut chrysanthemum with 500 mg/l thyme oil (6.89, 2.37, 5.99 mg/g, and 0.88 mg/gm D.W, respectively). Furthermore, the treatment of cut flowers with selected oils has significantly decreased the bacterial growth compared to the control. Whereas the minimum bacterial activities were &lt;1 C.F.U/ml with cut chrysanthemum fortified with 500 mg/l thyme and clove oils. Moreover, the superlative treatments with thyme (500 mg/l) and clove (250 mg/l) showed a prime state of xylem vessels comparable with the control.thus, the usage (addition) of thyme and clove oils as a natural preservative in holding solutions instead of chemicals would be of great economic and environmental impact (Values).">

        <span class="abst" title="Infectious diseases constitute a problem of great importance for animal and human health, as well as the increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. In this context, medicinal plants emerge as an effective alternative to replace the use antibiotics. The essential oil (EO) of &lt;i&gt;Minthostachys verticillata&lt;/i&gt; (Griseb.) Epling (Lamiaceae) has demonstrated a strong antimicrobial activity. However, its instability and hydrophobicity under normal storage conditions are limitations to its use. Nanoemulsion technology is an excellent way to solubilize, microencapsulate, and protect this compound. This study aimed to obtain a nanoemulsion based on &lt;i&gt;M. verticillata&lt;/i&gt; EO and evaluate its antibacterial activity against &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;. The EO was obtained by steam distillation. Identification and quantification of their components were determined by GC-MS revealing that the dominated chemical group was oxygenated monoterpenes. Nanoemulsions (NE) were characterized by measuring pH, transmittance, separation percentage, release profile, and morphology. The effect of NE on the growth of &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; and cyto-compatibility was also evaluated. The results showed that NE containing a higher percentage of tween 20 exhibited higher stability with an approximated droplet size of 10 nm. The effect of encapsulation process was evaluated by GC-MS revealing that the volatile components in EO were no affected. After 24 h, 74.24 ± 0.75% of EO was released from NE and the antibacterial activity of EO was enhanced considerably by its encapsulation. The incubation of &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; with the NE and pure EO, show a bacterial growth inhibition of 58.87% ± 0.99 and 46.72% ± 3.32 (p &lt; 0.05), respectively. In addition, nanoemulsión did not cause toxicity to porcine and equine red blood cells. The results obtained showed that NE could be a potential vehicle for &lt;i&gt;M. verticillata&lt;/i&gt; EO with promissory properties to emerge as a tool for developing advanced therapies to control and combat infections.">

        <span class="abst" title="In ethnopharmacological research, many field assessment tools exist. Yet, these miss that critical point of how to really determine which species merit the costly lab studies, e.g., evaluation of traditional use via pharmacological assays and isolation of bioactive secondary metabolites. This gap can be filled with the introduction of a new tool for literature assessment: the Degrees of Publication (DoPs). In this study, its application is illustrated through an extensive bibliographic assessment of 16 medicinal plant species that were recently identified in the Greater Mpigi region of Uganda as being frequently used by local traditional healers in the treatment of medical disorders (namely, &lt;i&gt;Albizia coriaria&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cassine buchananii&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Combretum molle&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Erythrina abyssinica&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Ficus saussureana&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Harungana madagascariensis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Leucas calostachys&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Microgramma lycopodioides&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Morella kandtiana&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Plectranthus hadiensis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Securidaca longipedunculata&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Sesamum calycinum&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;angustifolium&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Solanum aculeastrum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Toddalia asiatica&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Warburgia ugandensis,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Zanthoxylum chalybeum&lt;/i&gt;). These species are suspected to be understudied, and a thorough bibliographic assessment has not been previously performed. Thus, the objectives of our study were to undertake a comparative assessment of the degree to which each of these plant species has been studied in the past, including evaluation of the quality of the journals where results were published in. The determination of the DoPs enabled successful assessment of the degrees to which each individual plant species has been studied so far, while also taking into account the methodological &quot;research chain of ethnopharmacology&quot; from ethnobotanical studies (&quot;traditional use&quot;) to pharmacological assays (&quot;bioactivity&quot;) and finally to pharmacognostic research (&quot;structure elucidation&quot;). The significance of a research paper was assessed by determining whether its journal and publishing house were members of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE). In total, 634 peer-reviewed publications were reviewed covering the period of 1960-2019, 53.3% of which were published in journals and by publishing houses affiliated with COPE (338 publications). The literature assessment resulted in the identification of understudied plants among the selected species. The majority of plants reviewed have not been sufficiently studied; six species were classified as being highly understudied and three more as being understudied: &lt;i&gt;C. buchananii&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;F. saussureana&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;L. calostachys&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;M. lycopodioides&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;M. kandtiana&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;S. calycinum&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;angustifolium&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A. coriaria&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;P. hadiensis,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S. aculeastrum,&lt;/i&gt; respectively. The newly introduced DoPs are a useful tool for the selection of traditionally used species for future laboratory studies, especially for pharmacological bioassays, isolation procedures, and drug discovery strategies.">

However, the consumption of baobab seed oil has been perceived by different communities as a health risk caused by cyclopropenoid fatty acids (CPFAs), which are carcinogenic ingredients present in the oil. This study investigated the physicochemical properties and fatty acid profile of baobab crude seed oil collected from semiarid areas in Tanzania and determined the effects of heating on the reduction of CPFAs. The baobab seed crude oil was extracted by Soxhlet using n-hexane, and the fatty acid composition of the baobab seed crude oil was determined by gas-liquid chromatography (GLC). Since CPFAs are resistant to lower temperatures, the effect of heating on the CPFA content of baobab crude seed oil was studied at 150°C, 200°C, and 250°C. The &lt;i&gt;A. digitata&lt;/i&gt; crude seed oil was found to contain mainly twelve essential fatty acids and two different CPFAs. The most abundant fatty acids were palmitic acid, oleic acid, and linoleic acid in all the baobab population hotspots occurring in Tanzania. There was no significant difference in most physicochemical properties and fatty acid composition across the different semiarid areas in Tanzania. The major breakdown of CPFAs occurs at 200°C, and that would be the optimal temperature recommended for the refining process of the baobab crude oil. The study recommended refining of the baobab oil at higher temperatures ranging from 200 - 250°C as the best way of reducing CPFAs.">

Antioxidants are important components in the signaling and defense mechanisms in some plants, where they are precursors of compounds of greater complexity, the modulator of plant growth, and the defensive system against pathogenic organisms and predators. The extraordinary variety of chemical structure and substitution present in the different plant antioxidants make them an inestimable source of interesting compounds, with the ability to counter reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) and to stimulate the activation of signal cascade inside the cells. The mechanisms by which antioxidants detoxify these dangerous compounds are complex and involve either direct or indirect interaction with radicals. Antioxidants inhibit or quench free radical reactions mainly based on their reducing capacity or hydrogen atom-donating capacity, their solubility, and chelating properties. Moreover, their ability to modulate key metabolic enzymes and activate/block gene transcription also has remarkable importance.">

        <span class="abst" title="Wild food plants (WFP) have always been present in our kitchen, although they have not always been given the same importance as crops. In the Catalan linguistic area (CLA), covered in this paper, WFP were of great importance as a subsistence food not only during the years of the Spanish civil war (1936-1939) and World War II (1939-1945), but also long before these periods and in the years thereafter. The CLA has been well studied at the level of traditional knowledge on plant biodiversity, and much of this information is collected in a database by the EtnoBioFiC research group. The aim of this work is to carry out a meta-analysis of the WFP dataset of he CLA (only regarding edible uses, drinks excluded) and to identify the most quoted plants, and the information associated with them. With data from 1659 informants, we recorded 10,078 use reports of 291 taxa (278 of which at specific or subspecific levels and 13 only determined at generic level) belonging to 67 families. The most reported taxa, also with highest cultural importance indexes, are &lt;i&gt;Thymus vulgaris&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Foeniculum vulgare&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;piperitum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Laurus nobilis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Rubus ulmifolius&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mentha spicata&lt;/i&gt;. The ethnobotanicity index for food plants is 6.62% and the informant consensus factor, also for food uses, is a very high 0.97, supporting the robustness of the information. The results provided and discussed in this work concern a significant part of the edible resources in the territory considered, which is, often and mainly, underestimated and underutilised. Its consideration could be an opportunity to promote closer and more sustainable agriculture. From the state-of-the-art of this question, it is possible to propose old, in some cases forgotten foods that could be newly introduced onto the market, first, but not only, at a local level, which could be interesting for new crop development in the frame of a valorisation of territorial identity.">

        <span class="abst" title="Plants and their constituents have been used to treat diverse ailments since time immemorial. Many plants are used in diverse external and internal formulations (infusions, alcoholic extracts, essential oils (EOs), etc.) in the treatment of inflammation-associated diseases, such as those affecting the respiratory tract or causing gastrointestinal or joint problems, among others. To support the traditional uses of plant extracts, EOs have been assessed for their alleged anti-inflammatory properties. However, the effect of EOs on the release of cytokines and chemokines has been much less reported. Considering their traditional use and commercial relevance in Portugal and Angola, this study evaluated the effect of EOs on the in vitro inhibition of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human acute monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1 cells). Twenty EOs extracted from eighteen species from seven families, namely from Amaranthaceae (&lt;i&gt;Dysphania ambrosioides&lt;/i&gt;), Apiaceae (&lt;i&gt;Foeniculum vulgare&lt;/i&gt;), Asteraceae (&lt;i&gt;Brachylaena huillensis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Solidago virgaurea&lt;/i&gt;), Euphorbiaceae (&lt;i&gt;Spirostachys africana&lt;/i&gt;), Lamiaceae (&lt;i&gt;Lavandula luisieri&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Mentha cervina&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Origanum majorana&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Satureja montana&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Thymbra capitata&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Thymus mastichina&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Thymus vulgaris&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Thymus zygis&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;zygis&lt;/i&gt;), Myrtaceae (&lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus globulus&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;maidenii&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus radiata&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus viminalis&lt;/i&gt;) and Pinaceae (&lt;i&gt;Pinus pinaster&lt;/i&gt;) were assayed for the release of CCL2 and TNF-α by LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells. &lt;i&gt;B. huillensis, S. africana, S. montana, Th. mastichina&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Th. vulgaris&lt;/i&gt; EOs showed toxicity to THP-1 cells, at the lowest concentration tested (10 μg/mL), using the tetrazolium dye assay. The most active EOs in reducing TNF-α release by LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells were those of &lt;i&gt;T. capitata&lt;/i&gt; (51% inhibition at 20 μg/mL) and &lt;i&gt;L. luisieri&lt;/i&gt; (15-23% inhibition at 30 μg/mL and 78-83% inhibition at 90 μg/mL). &lt;i&gt;L. luisieri&lt;/i&gt; EO induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of CCL2 release by LPS‑stimulated THP-1 cells (23%, 54% and 82% inhibition at 10, 30 and 90 μg/mL, respectively). These EOs are potentially useful in the management of inflammatory diseases mediated by CCL2 and TNF‑α, such as atherosclerosis and arthritis.">

Fingerlings (8.503 ± 0.009 g) were fed on 0.0%, 1% and 2.5% black seed supplemented diets for 28 days. Fish sampling was done on the 7th, 14th, 21st and 28th day of experiment. The results of the present study indicated that black seed supplementation significantly increased growth performance and muscles protein contents of rohu over un-supplemented ones. Lipid peroxidation levels significantly decreased in all the studied tissues (liver, gills, kidney and brain) of black seed fed rohu, whereas the antioxidant enzymes (catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase and reduced glutathione) activities were increased in all the studied tissues of black seed supplemented rohu at each sampling day. The hepatic-nephric marker enzymes levels were decreased for black seed fed rohu. The present study showed that tested black seed levels are safe for rohu. Black seed is cheaply available in local markets of Pakistan; therefore, based on the results of the present study, it is suggested that black seed has potential to be used as natural growth promoter and antioxidant in the diet of rohu.">

Mainly due to the polyphenols contained in &lt;i&gt;S. hortensis&lt;/i&gt; L., this plant exhibits multiple biological effects. However, therapeutic effects on cells, including skin tumors, have not yet been studied. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the composition and the resulting antioxidant as well as biological properties [on melanocytes and melanoma cells] of summer, savory growing in botanical garden of Vytautas Magnus University in middle Lithuania climatic conditions, collected during various phases of vegetation. It has been shown that the budding phase alcohol extract of this plant contains the largest amounts of polyphenols, including rutin and rosemary acid, which promote the radical scavenging activity and antioxidant properties. In contrast, the extract from the massive flowering phase already at a concentration of 12.5 µg/mL reduces the survival of melanoma cells to 60% with 90% melanocytes survival. In addition, extracts from beginning of flowering and end of flowering at a concentration of 25 µg/mL, containing significantly less rutin and rosmarinic acid, in combination with irradiation of cells with UVB, significantly increased the lipid peroxidation process, particularly in melanoma cells. These data indicate the possibility of using extracts from &lt;i&gt;S. hortensis&lt;/i&gt; L. to modulate/differentiate the metabolism of normal and tumor skin cells.">

        <span class="abst" title="Silphion was an ancient medicinal gum-resin; most likely obtained from a &lt;i&gt;Ferula&lt;/i&gt; species growing in the Cyrene region of Libya ca. 2500 years ago. Due to its therapeutic properties and culinary value, silphion became the main economic commodity of the Cyrene region. It is generally believed that the source of silphion became extinct in the first century AD. However, there are a few references in the literature about the cultivated silphion plant and its existence up to the fifth century. Recently, a rare and endemic &lt;i&gt;Ferula&lt;/i&gt; species that produces a pleasant-smelling gum-resin was found in three locations near formerly Greek villages in Anatolia. Morphologic features of this species closely resemble silphion, as it appears in the numismatic figures of antique Cyrenaic coins, and conform to descriptions by ancient authors. Initial chemical and pharmacological investigations of this species have confirmed the medicinal and spice-like quality of its gum-resin supporting a connection with the long-lost silphion. A preliminary conservation study has been initiated at the growth site of this rare endemic &lt;i&gt;Ferula&lt;/i&gt; species. The results of this study and their implications on the regional extinction event, and future development of this species will be discussed.">

        <span class="abst" title="Fungal infections affect 300 million people and cause 1.5 million deaths globally per year. With the number of immunosuppressed patients increasing steadily, there is an increasing number of patients infected with opportunistic fungal infections such as infections caused by the species of &lt;i&gt;Candida&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Cryptococcus&lt;/i&gt;. In fact, the drug-resistant &lt;i&gt;Can. krusei&lt;/i&gt; and the emerging pan-antifungal resistant &lt;i&gt;Can. auris&lt;/i&gt; pose a serious threat to human health as the existing limited antifungals are futile. To further complicate therapy, fungi produce capsules and spores that are resistant to most antifungal drugs/host defenses. Novel antifungal drugs are urgently needed to fill unmet medical needs. From screening a collection of medicinal plant sources for antifungal activity, we have identified an active fraction from the rhizome of &lt;i&gt;Cyperus rotundus&lt;/i&gt;, the nut grass plant. The fraction contained α-Cyperone, an essential oil that showed fungicidal activity against different species of &lt;i&gt;Candida&lt;/i&gt;. Interestingly, the minimal inhibitory concentration of α-Cyperone was reduced 8-fold when combined with a clinical antifungal drug, fluconazole, indicating its antifungal synergistic potential and could be useful for combination therapy. Furthermore, α-Cyperone affected the synthesis of the capsule in &lt;i&gt;Cryp. neoformans&lt;/i&gt;, a causative agent of fungal meningitis in humans. Further work on mechanistic understanding of α-Cyperone against fungal virulence could help develop a novel antifungal agent for drug-resistant fungal pathogens.">

The total phenolic and total flavonoid contents, together with the biological activities of the derived essential oils and methanol extracts, were also investigated. Herein, the success of obtaining sequences of these plant using two different barcode genes &lt;i&gt;mat&lt;/i&gt;K and &lt;i&gt;rbc&lt;/i&gt;L were 62.5% and 100%, respectively. Both regions were discriminated by around 700 base pairs and these had resemblance with those of the Clausenae materials earlier deposited in Genbank at a 99-100% degree of identity. Additionally, the use of &lt;i&gt;mat&lt;/i&gt;K DNA sequences could positively confirm the identity as monophyletic. The highest total phenolic and total flavonoid content values (&lt;i&gt;p &lt;&lt;/i&gt; 0.05) were observed in the methanol extract of &lt;i&gt;M. koenigii&lt;/i&gt; at 43.50 mg GAE/g extract and 66.13 mg QE/g extract, respectively. Furthermore, anethole was detected as the dominant compound in &lt;i&gt;C. excavata&lt;/i&gt; (86.72%) and &lt;i&gt;C. harmandiana&lt;/i&gt; (46.09%). Moreover, anethole (26.02%) and caryophyllene (21.15%) were identified as the major phytochemical compounds of &lt;i&gt;M. koenigii&lt;/i&gt;. In terms of the biological properties, the &lt;i&gt;M. koenigii&lt;/i&gt; methanol extract was found to display the greatest amount of antioxidant activity (DPPH; IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 95.54 µg/mL, ABTS value 118.12 mg GAE/g extract, FRAP value 48.15 mg GAE/g extract), and also revealed the highest &lt;i&gt;α-&lt;/i&gt;glucosidase and antihypertensive inhibitory activities with percent inhibition values of 84.55 and 84.95. Notably, no adverse effects on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were observed with regard to all of the plant extracts. Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;M. koenigii&lt;/i&gt; methanol extract exhibited promise against human lung cancer cells almost at 80% after 24 h and 90% over 48 h.">

Ninety-seven metabolites were identified, accounting for 73.28, 87.03, 74.38, 87.93, 85.83, and 91.39% of &lt;i&gt;Aca&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Ach&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Ale&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Ama&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Amu&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Asi&lt;/i&gt; whole oils, respectively. Sylvestrene was the most predominant component in &lt;i&gt;Asi, Amu&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ama&lt;/i&gt;, with highest concentration in &lt;i&gt;Asi&lt;/i&gt; (64.64%). In addition, (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-2-hexenal was present in a high percentage in both &lt;i&gt;Ale&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ach&lt;/i&gt; (9.97 and 10.1%, respectively). GC-MS based metabolites were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchal cluster analysis (HCA) to explore the correlations between the six species. The PCA score plot displayed clear differentiation of all &lt;i&gt;Astragalus&lt;/i&gt; species and a high correlation between the &lt;i&gt;Amu&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ama&lt;/i&gt; species. The antioxidant activity was evaluated in vitro using various assays, phosphomolybdenum (PM), 2,2 diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate (DPPH), 2,2-azino bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS), cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC), ferric reducing power (FRAP) and ferrous ion chelation (FIC) assays. In addition, the potential for the volatile samples to inhibit both acetyl/butyrylcholinesterases (AChE, BChE), α- amylase, α-glucosidase and tyrosinase was assessed. Most of the species showed considerable antioxidant potential in the performed assays. In the DPPH assay, &lt;i&gt;Ama&lt;/i&gt; exhibited the maximum activity (24.12 ± 2.24 mg TE/g sample), and the volatiles from &lt;i&gt;Amu&lt;/i&gt; exhibited the highest activity (91.54 mgTE/g oil) in the ABTS radical scavenging assay. The effect was more evident in both CUPRAC and FRAP assays, where both &lt;i&gt;Ale&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ama&lt;/i&gt; showed the strongest activity in comparison with the other tested species (84.06, 80.28 mgTE/g oil for CUPRAC and 49.47, 49.02 mgTE/g oil for FRAP, respectively). &lt;i&gt;Asi&lt;/i&gt; demonstrated the strongest AChE (4.55 mg GALAE/g oil) and BChE (3.61 mg GALAE/g oil) inhibitory effect. Furthermore, the best tyrosinase inhibitory potential was observed for &lt;i&gt;Ale&lt;/i&gt; (138.42 mg KAE/g). Accordingly, &lt;i&gt;Astragalus&lt;/i&gt; species can be utilized as promising natural sources for many medicinally important components that could be tested as drug candidates for treating illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease, diabetes mellitus and oxidative stress-related diseases.">

Comprehensive information on &lt;i&gt;Parkia&lt;/i&gt; species was retrieved from electronic databases, which were Web of Science, ScienceDirect, PubMed, and Google Scholar. This review identified nine species from genus &lt;i&gt;Parkia&lt;/i&gt; with properties of medicinal use. They are used traditionally to treat several ailments, such as diabetes, diarrhea, wounds, hypertension, cough, chronic piles, conjunctivitis, and measles. The most common species studied are &lt;i&gt;P. biglobosa&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;P. speciosa&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;P. javanica&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;P. bicolor&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;P. biglandulosa&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;P. filicoidea&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;P. clappertoniana&lt;/i&gt;. A considerable number of secondary metabolites, such as terpenoids, phenolic acids, flavonoids (aglycone and glycosides), and numerous volatile compounds have been identified in this genus, which are responsible for their diverse pharmacological activities. Their extracts, pure compounds and seed lectins have been reported for their anticancer, antimicrobial, antihypertensive, antiulcer, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimalarial, hepatoprotective, and antidiarrheal activities. The information gathered in this review might be of help for future studies in terms of the current knowledge on the link between the phytochemical components and medicinal uses. This could facilitate more discoveries on its potentials particularly in the pharmacological characteristics and potential to be developed into modern medicines.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Rhus coriaria&lt;/i&gt; L. (Anacardiaceae), commonly known as sumac, is a commonly used spice, condiment, and flavoring agent, especially in the Mediterranean region. Owing to its bountiful beneficial values, sumac has been used in traditional medicine for the management and treatment of many ailments including hemorrhoids, wound healing, diarrhea, ulcer, and eye inflammation. This plant is rich in various classes of phytochemicals including flavonoids, tannins, polyphenolic compounds, organic acids, and many others. By virtue of its bioactive, &lt;i&gt;Rhus coriaria&lt;/i&gt; possesses powerful antioxidant capacities that have ameliorative and therapeutic benefits for many common diseases including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. This review describes the phytochemical properties of &lt;i&gt;R. coriaria&lt;/i&gt; and then focuses on the potent antioxidant capacities of sumac. We then dissect the cellular and molecular mechanisms of sumac's action in modulating many pathophysiological instigators. We show how accumulating evidence supports the antibacterial, antinociceptive, antidiabetic, cardioprotective, neuroprotective, and anticancer effects of this plant, especially that toxicity studies show that sumac is very safe to consume by humans and has little toxicity. Taken together, the findings we summarize here support the utilization of this plant as an attractive target for drug discovery.">

Medicinal plants and their bioactive molecules are potential candidates for improving human health. In this work, we studied the effect of &lt;i&gt;Ptychotis verticillata&lt;/i&gt; (PV) essential oil and its derivatives, carvacrol and thymol, in AML cell lines. We demonstrated that a combination of carvacrol and thymol induced tumor cell death with low toxicity on normal cells. Mechanistically, we highlighted that different molecular pathways, including apoptosis, oxidative, reticular stress, autophagy, and necrosis, are implicated in this potential synergistic effect. Using quantitative RT-PCR, Western blotting, and apoptosis inhibitors, we showed that cell death induced by the carvacrol and thymol combination is caspase-dependent in the HL60 cell line and caspase-independent in the other cell lines tested. Further investigations should focus on improving the manufacturing of these compounds and understanding their anti-tumoral mechanisms of action. These efforts will lead to an increase in the efficiency of the oncotherapy strategy regarding AML.">

Antioxidant potential was monitored as: (i) direct antioxidant activity as assessed by 2,2-di-phenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), and ABTS assays; (ii) DNA damage protection activity; and (iii) cytoprotective activity as assessed via induction of transcription of genes related to the antioxidant response in human keratinocyte cells (HaCaT). The cytoprotective potential of the test substances was further evaluated against ultraviolet radiation B (UVB)- or H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced oxidative damage, whereas their regenerative capability was accessed by monitoring the wound closure rate in HaCaT. Μastic oil and major components did not show significant direct antioxidant activity, however they increased the mRNA levels of antioxidant response genes, suggesting indirect antioxidant activity. Treatment of HaCaT with the test substances before and after UVB irradiation resulted in increased cell viability in the cases of pre-treatment with mastic oil or post-treatment with myrcene. Increased cytoprotection was also observed in the case of cell treatment with mastic oil or its major components prior to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exposure. Finally, mastic oil and myrcene demonstrated a favorable dose-dependent effect for cell migration and wound closure. Collectively, mastic essential oil may exert its promising cytoprotective properties through indirect antioxidant mechanisms.">

The treatment for cutaneous infections caused by &lt;i&gt;Trichophyton&lt;/i&gt; spp. are imidazoles (ketoconazole (KTZ)) and triazoles (itraconazole (ITZ)). &lt;i&gt;T. rubrum&lt;/i&gt; can develop resistance to azoles after prolonged exposure to subinhibitory concentrations resulting in therapeutic failures and chronic infections. These problems have stimulated the search for therapeutic alternatives, including essential oils, and their potential use in combination with conventional antifungals. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antifungal activity of tea tree oil (TTO) (&lt;i&gt;Melaleuca alternifolia&lt;/i&gt; essential oil) and the main components against &lt;i&gt;T. rubrum&lt;/i&gt; and to assess whether TTO in association with KTZ/ITZ as reference drugs improves the antifungal activity of these drugs. We used a terpinen-4-ol chemotype (35.88%) TTO, and its antifungal properties were evaluated by minimum inhibitory and minimum fungicidal concentrations in accordance with the CLSI guidelines. The interaction between TTO and azoles was evaluated through the checkerboard and isobologram methods. The results demonstrated both the fungicide activity of TTO on &lt;i&gt;T. rubrum&lt;/i&gt; and the synergism when it was used in combination with azoles. Therefore, this mixture may reduce the minimum effective dose of azole required and minimize the side effects of the therapy. Synergy activity offered a promise for combination topical treatment for superficial mycoses.">

Mango is commercially important in India, where ~55% of the global crop is produced. The fruit has three main parts: pulp, peel, and kernel. The pulp is the most-consumed part, while the peel and kernel are usually discarded. Mango pulp is a source of a variety of reducing sugars, amino acids, aromatic compounds, and functional compounds, such as pectin, vitamins, anthocyanins, and polyphenols. Mango processing generates peels and kernels as bio-wastes, though they also have nutraceutical significance. Functional compounds in the peel, including protocatechuic acids, mangiferin and β-carotene are known for their antimicrobial, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-carcinogenic properties. The mango kernel has higher antioxidant and polyphenolic contents than the pulp and peel and is used for oil extraction; it's possible usage in combination with corn and wheat flour in preparing nutraceuticals is being increasingly emphasized. This review aims to provide nutraceutical and pharmacological information on all three parts of mango to help understand the defense mechanisms of its functional constituents, and the appropriate use of mangoes to enhance our nutrition and health.">

Apart from the many synthetic chemical compounds, plant-based compounds could provide an array of \suitable candidates for testing against the virus. Studies have confirmed the role of many plants against respiratory viruses when employed either as crude extracts or their active ingredients in pure form. The purpose of this review article is to highlight the importance of phytomedicine against COVID-19. The main aim is to review the mechanistic aspects of most important phytochemical compounds that have showed potential against coronaviruses. Glycyrrhizin from the roots of &lt;i&gt;Glycyrrhiza glabra&lt;/i&gt; has shown promising potential against the previously epidemic coronavirus, SARS-CoV. Other important plants such as &lt;i&gt;Artemisia annua&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Isatis indigotica, Lindera aggregate&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pelargonium sidoides&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Glychirrhiza&lt;/i&gt; spp. have been employed against SARS-CoV. Active ingredients (e.g. emodin, reserpine, aescin, myricetin, scutellarin, apigenin, luteolin, and betulonic acid) have shown promising results against the coronaviruses. Phytochemicals have demonstrated activity against the coronaviruses through mechanisms such as viral entry inhibition, inhibition of replication enzymes and virus release blockage. However, compared to synthetic drugs, phytomedicine are mechanistically less understood and should be properly evaluated before application. Nonetheless, phytochemicals reduce the tedious job of drug discovery and provide a less time-consuming alternative for drug testing. Therefore, along with other drugs currently tested against COVID-19, plant-based drugs should be included for speedy development of COVID-19 treatment.">

Those industries transform agricultural raw materials into added-value products. The fruit and vegetable industry is the largest and fastest-growing segment of the world agricultural production market, which commercialize various products such as juices, jams, and dehydrated products, followed by the cereal industry products such as chocolate, beer, and vegetable oils are produced. Similarly, the root and tuber industry produces flours and starches essential for the daily diet due to their high carbohydrate content. However, the processing of these foods generates a large amount of waste several times improperly disposed of in landfills. Due to the increase in the world's population, the indiscriminate use of natural resources generates waste and food supply limitations due to the scarcity of resources, increasing hunger worldwide. The circular economy offers various tools for raising awareness for the recovery of waste, one of the best alternatives to mitigate the excessive consumption of raw materials and reduce waste. The loss and waste of food as a raw material offers bioactive compounds, enzymes, and nutrients that add value to the food cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. This paper systematically reviewed literature with different food loss and waste by-products as animal feed, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical products that strongly contribute to the paradigm shift to a circular economy. Additionally, this review compiles studies related to the integral recovery of by-products from the processing of fruits, vegetables, tubers, cereals, and legumes from the food industry, with the potential in SARS-CoV-2 disease and bacterial diseases treatment.">

Towards the end of 2019, the novel coronavirus identified in Wuhan, China, presented as a cluster of symptoms of pneumonia. Its quick spread resulted in a global pandemic. This research documents detailed ethnopharmacological information on the medicinal plant species used by herbalists against coronavirus disease.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;The study was conducted in Salé Prefecture, from March 1st, 2020 to May 31st, 2020. Semi-structured face to face interviews were held with 30 herbalists and collected; socio-demographic characteristics, the names of local species, and traditional remedies being used. The data were analyzed through the use reports (UR) and medicinal use value (MUV).&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;In total, 20 plant species from 20 genera and 14 families had been most frequently used by herbalists from Salé Prefecture for the prevention and treatment of COVID 19. The most mentioned plant was &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus globulus&lt;/i&gt; Labill., followed by &lt;i&gt;Azadirachta indica&lt;/i&gt; A. Juss,. and &lt;i&gt;Ziziphus lotus&lt;/i&gt; (L.) Lam. Moreover, the most commonly used plant parts for herbal preparations were leaves (28.43%) and seeds (17.5%), and the majority of remedies were prepared through infusion.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;The present study is the first contribution to the ethnopharmacological profile of this Prefecture. It is recommended that the constituents of indigenous species be studied to determine the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of action. However, attention must be paid to the conservation of medicinal species, comprehensively documenting traditional medicinal knowledge as well as conducting phytochemical validation of reported plants.">

        <span class="abst" title="Hyptis crenata, commonly known as &quot;salva-do-Marajó&quot;, &quot;hortelã-do-campo&quot;, and &quot;hortelãzinha&quot;, is used in folk medicine in Northeast Brazil as tea or infusion to treat inflammatory diseases. Due to the pharmacological efficacy and the low toxicity of the essential oil of Hyptis crenata (EOHc), we decided to investigate the EOHc antiedematogenic effect in experimental models of inflammation. EOHc was administrated orally at doses of 10-300 mg/kg to male Swiss albino mice. Paw edema was induced by subcutaneous injection in the right hind paw of inflammatory stimuli (carrageenan, dextran, histamine, serotonin, and bradykinin) 60 min after administration of EOHc. EOHc significantly inhibited the induced edema. The inhibitory effect of EOHc on dextran-induced edema extended throughout the experimental time. For the 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg doses of EOHc, the inhibition was of 40.28±1.70, 51.18±2.69, and 59.24±2.13%, respectively. The EOHc inhibitory effect on carrageenan-induced edema started at 10 mg/kg at the second hour (h) and was maintained throughout the observation period. At 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg doses the inhibition started earlier, from 30 min. At the edema peak of 180 min, 56, 76, and 82% inhibition was observed for 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg doses, respectively. Additionally, the effect of EOHc on carrageenan-induced paw edema was influenced by the time of administration. The EOHc also inhibited myeloperoxidase activity. In conclusion, the EOHc showed a potent effect, both preventing and reversing the edema, consistent with its anti-inflammatory use in folk medicine.">

        <span class="abst" title="Scabiosa comosa and S. tschilliensis (SCST) are traditionally used for liver diseases in Mongolian medicine. However, their active ingredients and molecular mechanisms are unknown. The present study employed network pharmacology and experimental verification approaches to decipher the common pharmacological mechanisms of SCST on liver fibrosis, which is the key step in liver diseases. We predicted the targets of all available SCST ingredients with the SWISS and SuperPred servers and clustered the targets related to liver fibrosis from DrugBank, the OMIM database and the literature. We further evaluated the links between the herbal ingredients and pharmacological actions to explore the potential mechanism of action of SCST. We found that the PPARG signalling pathway could be regulated by SCST for liver fibrosis through enrichment analysis. The key targets included 8 co-targets, including HSP90AA1, PPARG, HSP90AB1, STAT1, etc., which play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis. Additionally, the top 15 key compounds included flavonoids and phenylpropanoids. Central to the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis is trans-differentiation or activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Therefore, LX2 cells, an immortalized human HSC line, were studied. Here, a total 37 components were isolated and identified from the inflorescences of SCST, including the new compound tschilliensisin, and the first separated components, β-sitosterol and luteolin, and these compounds were assessed against anti-hepatic fibrosis. An MTT assay and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting analyses demonstrated that the flavonoids of SCST revealed anti-hepatic fibrosis effects via anti-proliferation and increases in the Stat1, Pparg, Hsp90aa1 genes and STAT1 and PPARG proteins in LX-2 cells. In conclusion, these results indicate that SCST has multi-targeted and multi-component synergistic anti-hepatic fibrosis effects.">

Due to the abundant unsaturated fatty acids in its seed, it can also be regarded as a new oilseed plant. However, the process of the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids in it has remained unknown. Therefore, transcriptome analysis is helpful to better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Five main fatty acids were detected, including stearic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid and α-linolenic acid, and their absolute contents first increased and then decreased during seed development. A total of 150,156 unigenes were obtained by transcriptome sequencing. There were 15,005 unigenes annotated in the seven functional databases, including NR, NT, GO, KOG, KEGG, Swiss-Prot and InterPro. Based on the KEGG database, 1766 unigenes were annotated in the lipid metabolism. There were 4635, 12,304, and 18,291 DEGs in Group I (60 vs 30 DAF), Group II (90 vs 60 DAF) and Group III (90 vs 30 DAF), respectively. A total of 1480 DEGs were detected in the intersection of the three groups. In 14 KEGG pathways of lipid metabolism, 503 DEGs were found, belonging to 111 enzymes. We screened out 123 DEGs involved in fatty acid biosynthesis (39 DEGs), fatty acid elongation (33 DEGs), biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acid (24 DEGs), TAG assembly (17 DEGs) and lipid storage (10 DEGs). Furthermore, qRT-PCR was used to analyze the expression patterns of 16 genes, including BBCP, BC, MCAT, KASIII, KASII, FATA, FATB, KCR, SAD, FAD2, FAD3, FAD7, GPAT, DGAT, OLE and CLO, most of which showed the highest expression at 45 DAF, except for DGAT, OLE and CLO, which showed the highest expression at 75 DAF.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;We predicted that MCAT, KASIII, FATA, SAD, FAD2, FAD3, DGAT and OLE were the key genes in the unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and oil accumulation in herbaceous peony seed.

        <span class="abst" title="Fragrance is an integral part of cosmetic products and is often regarded as an overriding factor in the selection of cosmetics among consumers. Fragrances also play a considerable role in masking undesirable smells arising from fatty acids, oils and surfactants that are commonly used in cosmetic formulations. Essential oils are vital assets in the cosmetic industry, as along with imparting pleasant aromas in different products, they are able to act as preservatives and active agents and, simultaneously, offer various benefits to the skin. Moreover, the stimulating demand for natural ingredients has contributed massively to a renewed interest in cosmetic and wellness industries in plant derivatives, especially essential oils. This has led popular cosmetic companies to endorse natural fragrances and opt for minimally processed natural ingredients, given the potentially adverse health risks associated with artificial fragrance chemicals, which are major elements of cosmetics. Among the high-valued essential oils used as fragrances are citrus, lavender, eucalyptus, tea tree and other floral oils, among others, while linalool, geraniol, limonene, citronellol, and citral are much-appreciated fragrance components used in different cosmetics. Thus, this review aimed to highlight the enormous versatility of essential oils as significant sources of natural fragrances in cosmetics and cosmeceuticals. Moreover, a special focus will be laid on the different aspects related to essential oils such as their sources, market demand, chemistry, fragrance classification, aroma profile, authenticity and safety.">

        <span class="abst" title="The emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has urged researchers to explore therapeutic alternatives, one of which includes the use of natural plant products such as essential oils (EO). In fact, EO obtained from clove, oregano, thymus, cinnamon bark, rosemary, eucalyptus, and lavender have been shown to present significant inhibitory effects on bacteria, fungi, and viruses; many studies have been done to measure EO efficacy against microorganisms. The strategy of combinatory effects via conventional and non-conventional methods revealed that the combined effects of EO-EO or EO-antibiotic exhibit enhanced efficacy. This paper aims to review the antimicrobial effects of EO, modes of EO action (membrane disruption, efflux inhibition, increase membrane permeability, and decrease in intracellular ATP), and their compounds' potential as effective agents against bacteria, fungi, and viruses. It is hoped that the integration of EO applications in this work can be used to consider EO for future clinical applications.">

Rats were injected with a single dose of STZ (65 mg/kg) and treated with fennel (200 and 400 mg/kg), TA (80 mg/kg), or metformin (300 mg/kg) for 35 days. Serum lipid profile and liver enzyme activity (aminotransferases), oxidative stress markers, and the degree of fibrosis in the liver tissue were assessed. Both fennel and TA decreased blood glucose levels, reduced liver enzyme activity, food, and water intake, and intensity of weight loss, reduced serum triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c). Additionally, fennel and TA significantly reduced MDA concentration while increased CAT activity and thiol content and reduced the degree of injury and fibrosis in the liver of diabetic rats. Our results suggest that fennel seed extract and its active compound TA are able to protect the liver against diabetes-induced hepatic injury in rats, probably via hypoglycemic and antioxidant effects.">

The use of traditional medicine and plant extracts to treat diabetes is gaining high popularity in many countries. Countries in the Middle East region have a long history of using herbal medicine to treat different diseases, including diabetes. In this review, we compiled and summarized all the in vivo and in vitro studies conducted for plants with potential antidiabetic activity in the Middle East region. Plants of the Asteraceae and Lamiaceae families are the most investigated. It is hoped that this review will contribute scientifically to evidence the ethnobotanical use of medicinal plants as antidiabetic agents. Work has to be done to define tagetes, mechanism of action and the compound responsible for activity. In addition, safety and pharmacokinetic parameters should be investigated.">

        <span class="abst" title="Anopheles stephensi with three different biotypes is a major vector of malaria in Asia. It breeds in a wide range of habitats. Therefore, safer and more sustainable methods are needed to control its immature stages rather than chemical pesticides. The larvicidal and antibacterial properties of the Pelargonium roseum essential oil (PREO) formulations were investigated against mysorensis and intermediate forms of An. stephensi in laboratory conditions. A series of nanoemulsions containing different amounts of PREO, equivalent to the calculated LC50 values for each An. stephensi form, and various quantities of surfactants and co-surfactants were developed. The physical and morphological properties of the most lethal formulations were also determined. PREO and its major components, i.e. citronellol (21.34%), L-menthone (6.41%), linalool (4.214%), and geraniol (2.19%), showed potent larvicidal activity against the studied mosquitoes. The LC50/90 values for mysorensis and intermediate forms were computed as 11.44/42.42 ppm and 12.55/47.69 ppm, respectively. The F48/F44 nanoformulations with 94% and 88% lethality for the mysorensis and intermediate forms were designated as optimized formulations. The droplet size, polydispersity index, and zeta-potential for F48/F44 were determined as 172.8/90.95 nm, 0.123/0.183, and -1.08/-2.08 mV, respectively. These results were also confirmed by TEM analysis. Prepared formulations displayed antibacterial activity against larval gut bacteria in the following order of decreasing inhibitory: LC90, optimized nanoemulsions, and LC50. PREO-based formulations were more effective against mysorensis than intermediate. Compared to the crude PREO, the overall larvicidal activity of all nanoformulations boosted by 20% and the optimized formulations by 50%. The sensitivity of insect gut bacteria may be a crucial factor in determining the outcome of the effect of toxins on target insects. The formulations designed in the present study may be a good option as a potent and selective larvicide for An. stephensi.">

This study was aimed to explore the efficacy of several Egyptian plant extracts against Toxoplasma gondii infection in vitro for future development of a new, safe, and effective compound for T. gondii. Methanol extracts from Matricaria chamomilla (German chamomile), Laurus nobilis, Citrullus colocynthis, Cinnamum camphora, Boswellia scara, and Melissa officionalis plants and oil extracts (either essential or fixed oils) of some plants such as: lemon grass (Cymbopogon citratus), marjoram (Origanum majorana), watercress (Nasturtium officionale), wheat germ (Triticum aestivum), sesame (Sesamum indicum), rosemary (Salvia rosmarinus), citronella (Cymbopogon nardus), clove (Syzygum aromaticum), jojoba (Simmondsia chinesis), and basil (Ocimum basilicum) were investigated for their anti-Toxoplasma activities. The methanol extracts from C. colocynthis and L. nobilis and the oil extracts from lemon grass and marjoram were active against T. gondii with half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) of 22.86 µg/ml, 31.35 µg/ml, 4.6 µg/ml, and 26.24 µg/ml, respectively. Their selectivity index (SI) values were &lt;10. Interestingly, the methanol extract from M. chamomilla and oil from citronella had the lowest IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values for T. gondii (3.56 µg/ml and 2.54 µg/ml, respectively) and the highest SI values (130.33 and 15.02, respectively). In conclusion, methanol extract from M. chamomilla and oil from citronella might be potential sources of novel therapies for treating toxoplasmosis.">

Besides, thyroid disease is one of the common endocrine disorders spreading at high frequency worldwide. The present work is an ethnopharmacological study aiming to identify, document and analyze aromatic and medicinal plants used in Algerian traditional medicines for thyroid disorders management. Semi-structured interviews with 120 herbalists and traditional practitioners and rural dwellers were realized in eleven locations in Algeria throughout field studies achieved from June 2017 to July 2019. Results reveal the use of 63 medicinal plants belonging to 59 genera and 34 families. The most represented botanical families were Lamiaceae, Fabaceae, Apiaceae, Amaranthaceae and Asteraceae. However, the most cited plant species were &lt;i&gt;Atriplex halimus&lt;/i&gt; L., &lt;i&gt;Bunium incrassatum&lt;/i&gt; (Boiss.) Amo, &lt;i&gt;Nigella sativa&lt;/i&gt; L., &lt;i&gt;Aquilaria malaccensis&lt;/i&gt; Lam. and &lt;i&gt;Saussurea costus&lt;/i&gt; (Falc.) Lipsch. These species are taken alone or in mixtures of two or more ingredients from different origins such as honey, olive oil, and goat milk. Our findings revealed new therapeutic uses of 60 medicinal plants that have not been previously reported for the treatment of thyroid in Algeria. This is the first study documenting the traditional uses based on herbal medicine for thyroid management in Algeria. Our findings are relevant in the search for novel drug discovery. Obviously, it is the time to increase effective scientific studies on mechanisms of action of these medicinal plants in order to validate their popular usages.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;The current health concern to the entire world is the chronic respiratory disease caused by coronavirus 2 (COVID-19). A specific treatment or proper therapy is still lacking, and the investigations from across the world for proper drug/vaccine development towards disease control are in progress. The Coronavirus replication takes place by the conversion of the polypeptide into functional protein and this occurs due to the key enzyme Main protease (M&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt;). Therefore, identification of natural and effective M&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt; inhibitors could be a safe and promising approach for COVID-19 control.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;The present in silico study evaluates the effect of bioactive compounds found in Eucalyptus and Corymbia species essential oil on M&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt; by docking. Molecular docking of the major seven compounds of essential oil (citronellol, alpha-terpineol, eucalyptol, d-limonene, 3-carene, o-cymene, and alpha-pinene) with M&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt; was studied by AutoDock 4.2, and the properties were analysed by PreADMET and Biovia Discovery Studio visualizer.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The calculated parameters such as binding energy, hydrophobic interactions, and hydrogen bond interactions of 6LU7 (M&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt;) with Eucalyptus and Corymbia volatile secondary metabolites represented its scope as an effective therapy option against covid-19. Among the docked compounds, eucalyptol shows the least binding energy without toxicity.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;The outcome of this study reported that the essential oil of Eucalyptus and Corymbia species, mainly eucalyptol can be utilized as a potential inhibitor against COVID-19 and also it can be used in its treatment. Hence, further analysis was required to explore its potential application in medicine.">

        <span class="abst" title="Control of hyperglycemia and prevention of glucose reabsorption (glucotoxicity) are important objectives in the management of type 2 diabetes. This study deals with an oral combined dosage form design for two anti-diabetic drugs, sitagliptin and dapagliflozin using self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems (SNEDDS). The SNEDDS were developed using naturally obtained bioactive medium-chain/long-chain triglycerides oil, mixed glycerides and nonionic surfactants, and droplet size was measured followed by the test for antioxidant activities. Equilibrium solubility and dynamic dispersion experiments were conducted to achieve the maximum drug loading. The &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; digestion, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; bioavailability, and anti-diabetic effects were studied to compare the representative SNEDDS with marketed product Dapazin&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;. The representative SNEDDS containing black seed oil showed excellent self-emulsification performance with transparent appearance. Characterization of the SNEDDS showed nanodroplets of around 50-66.57 nm in size (confirmed by TEM analysis), in addition to the high drug loading capacity without causing any precipitation in the gastro-intestinal tract. The SNEDDS provided higher antioxidant activity compared to the pure drugs. The &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; pharmacokinetic parameters of SNEDDS showed significant increase in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt; &lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; (1.99 ± 0.21 µg mL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), AUC (17.94 ± 1.25 µg mL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), and oral absorption (2-fold) of dapagliflozin compared to the commercial product in the rat model. The anti-diabetic studies showed the significant inhibition of glucose level in treated diabetic mice by SNEDDS combined dose compared to the single drug therapy. The combined dose of sitagliptin-dapagliflozin using SNEDDS could be a potential oral pharmaceutical product for the improved treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;i&gt;Atractylodes lancea&lt;/i&gt; (AL) has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of various diseases including digestive disorders. Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a common digestive system disease with a low cure rate and easy recurrence. However, it is still not clear whether AL is suitable for UC treatment. Currently, stir-baking with wheat bran is most commonly used to process AL. Here, we aimed to address the effects of the crude and bran-processed AL on UC in vitro and uncover the underlying mechanism based on regulating the IKK/NF-kappa B signaling pathway.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Human colonic epithelial cells (HCoEpiC) were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mimic the inflammatory injury of UC in vitro. The essential oil from crude and bran-processed AL was used to treat LPS-induced HcoEpiC cells. The cell viability was detected by an MTT assay. The levels of IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-1-&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;, TNF-&lt;i&gt;α,&lt;/i&gt; and NO were determined by ELISA, and the mRNA expressions of IKK-&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;, NF-&lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt;B, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; were determined by RT-PCR. Meanwhile, the expressions of IKK-&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;, p-IKK-&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;, p-IKK-&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;, NF-&lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt;B, IL-6, and IL-8 proteins were determined by Western blot.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The essential oil of AL, whether it was from crude or bran-processed AL, could significantly increase the viability of LPS-induced HCoEpiC cells. The treatment of AL essential oil also notably inhibited the productions of IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-1-&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;, TNF-&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;, NO, p-IKK-&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;, p-IKK-&lt;i&gt;β,&lt;/i&gt; and NF-&lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt;B and downregulated the mRNA expressions of NF-&lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt;B, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;. Meanwhile, IL-4 protein and mRNA expression were significantly stimulated by AL essential oil. Moreover, the essential oil from bran-processed AL was more effective than that from crude AL.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Both kinds of AL essential oil had the anti-inflammatory effect on LPS-induced HCoEpiC, and the essential oil from bran-processed AL was more effective. The mechanism could be through the IKK/NF-&lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt;B signaling pathway in vitro.">

Because the chloroplast genome is rich with information about the species evolution as well as its genetic relationship to other species, the &lt;i&gt;P. caerulea&lt;/i&gt; chloroplast genome was sequenced, assembled, and annotated in this study. The &lt;i&gt;P. caerulea&lt;/i&gt; chloroplast genome is 151,362 bp in total with an overall GC content of 37.03%.

Ecotypic oils were extracted and analyzed with the GC-MS. Their biological properties in terms of antimicrobial, antioxidant, and antigenotoxic activities were evaluated using the minimal inhibitory concentration, minimal bactericidal concentration, and DPPH, &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-carotene, and comet assays. The GC-MS results for &lt;i&gt;Thymus daenensis&lt;/i&gt; Celak oils revealed thymol (73.86%) and carvacrol (51.89%) as the most abundant components. Due to the results, reasonable bactericidal activity values range from 0.14 to 5.00 mg/ml, and fungicidal activity ranges from 0.17 to 0.58 mg/ml. The necessary oil free radical scavenging capacity (0.41-1.79 mg/ml), bleaching inhibitory activity (0.01-1.06 mg/ml), and genoprotective potential (1.04-7.78 mg/ml) indicated the dose-dependent activity. The results suggest that &lt;i&gt;Thymus daenensis&lt;/i&gt; is an important antibacterial and antifungal bioresource. Additionally, the antioxidant and radical scavenging capacity suggests this species has a role as a natural preservative in oxidative diseases and in the prevention of food spoilage.">

The results also indicated that three compounds, namely α-Turmerone (32.41 and 35.16%), ar-Turmerone (25.20 and 25.47%), and Curlone (17.98 and 18.19%) dominated 75% of the essential oil component in Dame and Bonga 51/71 varieties, respectively. In summary, the results of this study revealed that extracts from Dame variety have strong biological potential with desired antioxidant and antibacterial activities.">

In view of this objective, the present study demonstrates the efficacy of lemongrass (LG) and tea tree essential oils (TTEOs) against &lt;i&gt;M. domestica&lt;/i&gt;. The TTEO proved to be more lethal against larvae and adults of &lt;i&gt;M. domestica&lt;/i&gt; depicting an LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; at 14.88 mg/ dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; which was 17.19 mg/ dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for LGEO. In contrast, pupicidal effect of LGEO was much higher (LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, 14.49 µl/0.25L) as compared to TTEO. The LGEO drastically reduced the total body sugar, glycogen and protein contents by 3.29, 2.95 and 7.56 fold, respectively, contrasting with high influence of TTEO on lipid content of the late 3rd instar larvae. A considerable reduction in gut enzymes secretion was observed due to treatment of EOs thereby altering gut physiology of the insect. Moreover, significant inhibition of acetylcholine esterase (AchE) was also observed with LGEO at LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; concentration (5.33 mg/ml) inhibiting insect neurotransmission. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) analysis of the LGEO showed 12 major compounds dominated by Citral whereas TTEO contained only 5 major compounds. Further analysis by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) revealed distortion and shrinkage of larval bodies caused by the treatment of EOs. These overall observations brand LG and TT-EOs as potential organic-insecticides against &lt;i&gt;M. domestica&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;h4&gt;Graphic abstract&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Supplementary information&lt;/h4&gt;The online version of this article (10.1007/s40011-020-01220-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.">

There are several reasons to use plants as TM, which are cheaply and easily available and have a cultural heritage of their uses across generations. &lt;i&gt;Leea,&lt;/i&gt; a genus of the Vitaceae family, possesses a large number of medicinal plants. In this review, the literature data on the traditional uses and pharmacological activities of &lt;i&gt;Leea&lt;/i&gt; species and their phytochemicals are compiled. All the information was collected from the scientific databases.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;i&gt;Leea&lt;/i&gt; species are endemic that have opened a promising research field to identify new leads against different diseases. &lt;i&gt;Leea&lt;/i&gt; contains approximately 70 species, which are widely distributed throughout the Northern and Eastern Australia, South and Southeast Asia and parts of Africa. The &lt;i&gt;Leea&lt;/i&gt; plants are used traditionally in different ailments such as fever, diarrhea, dysentery, joint pain, rheumatism, diabetes, bone fracture, body ache, wound, sexual disorders, and so on. The majority of the &lt;i&gt;Leea&lt;/i&gt; species are the medicinal plants, which have anticancer, cytotoxic, antimicrobial, antidiabetic, hepatoprotective, cardiovascular, and CNS activity. Moreover, phytochemicals such as flavonoids, glycosides, phenols, terpenoids, steroids, volatile oils, alkaloids, proteins, quinine derivatives, tannins, saponins, and many other organic compounds have been reported in the &lt;i&gt;Leea&lt;/i&gt; species (&lt;i&gt;Leea indica&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Leea macrophylla&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Leea asiatica&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Leea aequata, Leea rubra&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Leea guineensis&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; The presence of phytochemicals and the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; biological activities reported of these plants support their use as TM.

No cure exists for HSV-1 or HSV-2 infections, but antiviral medications are commonly used to prevent and treat outbreaks. Resistance to antivirals has begun to emerge, placing an importance on finding new and effective therapies for prophylaxis and treatment of HSV outbreaks. Botanicals may be effective HSV therapies as the constituents they contain act through a variety of mechanisms, potentially making the development of antiviral resistance more challenging. A wide variety of plants from different regions in the world have been studied for antiviral activity against HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 and showed efficacy of varying degrees. The purpose of this review is to summarize research conducted on whole plant extracts against HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 in vitro and in vivo. The majority of the research reviewed was conducted in vitro using animal cell lines, and some studies used an animal model design. Also summarized are a limited number of human trials conducted using botanical therapies on HSV lesions.">

        <span class="abst" title="Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infection of the respiratory system caused by single standard RNA viruses named as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease appeared as a serious problem and the leading cause of death in human beings throughout the world. The main source of different phytochemicals are plants, which helps in the development of new drugs against various ailments. Islam is comprehensive religion and a complete code of life for Muslims. The teaching of Islam, according to the Holy Quran and Hadith are universal for the benefit of humanity. Islam believes that every ailment is from God and who made the disease definitely made its medication. There is a complete guideline with regard to taking measures against infectious diseases such as quarantine and seeking medicinal treatment. The research objective is to gather the knowledge of medicinal plants described in the Holy Quran or utilized by the Prophet (SAW) for the treatment of different ailments or advised to use them to boost immunity and strengthen the body. Scientists across the globe have found these plants beneficial for many diseases and have antiviral potential. In present study, the six plant species including &lt;i&gt;Olea europaea, Nigella sativa, Allium Sativum, Allium cepa, Zingiber officinale&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Cassia senna&lt;/i&gt; were selected which contain phytochemicals like Calcium Elenolate, Thymoquinone, S-Allylcysteine, Dipropyl Disulfide, Sesquiterpene, Monoterpene, Pelargonidin 3-Galactoside ion and Kaempferol. The phytochemicals monoterpene (from &lt;i&gt;Zingiber officinale&lt;/i&gt;) shows best interaction with target proteins RdRP, 3CLPro, ACE2. Calcium Elonate (from olive) bonds with 3CLPro, ACE2 and Kemoferol and Pelargomidine (from Senna Makki) bonds with RdRP, ACE2. The ligands show a unique set of intersections i.e. hydrogen bonding, and alkyl interaction. These medicinal plants can be utilized immediately for the treatment of COVID-19 as their safety is already established. This treatment can enhance recovery when combined with other treatments. Furthermore, the screening of bioactive compounds or phytochemicals found in these plants can be utilized to design new therapeutic drug to treat COVID-19 pandemic.">

        <span class="abst" title="The parasitic diseases represent the most important health risk, especially in underdeveloped countries where they have a deep impact on public health. Trichomoniasis is a prevalent non-viral sexually transmitted disease, and a significant amount of new cases are identified each year globally. Furthermore, the infection is linked with serious concerns such as pregnancy outcomes, infertility, predisposition to cervical and prostate cancer, and increased transmission and acquisition of HIV. The therapy is restricted, adverse effects are often observed, and resistance to the drugs is emerging. Based on this, a new treatment for trichomoniasis is necessary. Natural products represent a rich source of bioactive compounds, and even today, they are used in the search for new drugs. Additionally, natural products provide a wide variety of leadership structures that can be used by the pharmaceutical industry as a template in the development of new drugs that are more effective and have fewer or no undesirable side effects compared to current treatments. This review focuses on the medicinal plants that possess anti-trichomonal activity in vitro or in vivo. An electronic database search was carried out covering the last three decades, i.e., 1990-2020. The literature search revealed that almost a dozen isolated phytoconstituents are being explored globally for their anti-trichomonal activity. Simultaneously, many countries have their own traditional or folk medicine for trichomoniasis that utilizes their native plants, as a whole, or even extracts. This review focuses mainly on the human parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. However, at some points mention is also made to Tritrichomonas foetus that causes trichomoniasis in animals of high veterinary and economical interest. We will focus on the plants and plant-based compounds and their anti-trichomonal activity. The literature search highlighted that there are abundant compounds that possess anti-trichomonal activity; however, in-depth in-vivo evaluation of compounds and their clinical evaluation has not been undertaken. There is a critical need for new anti-trichomonal compounds, and focused research on phytoconstituents can provide the way forward.">

The highest antioxidative ‎activity was observed in &lt;i&gt;Z. multiflora&lt;/i&gt; EO. The tested EOs showed the highest antioxidative ‎activity at a concentration of 2.00 g L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Ferric reducing antioxidant power value of &lt;i&gt;Z. multiflora, O. vulgare&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;S. aromaticum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C. verum&lt;/i&gt; was 2.01 ± 0.03, 1.47 ± 0.04, 1.01 ± 0.03, and 0.66 ± 0.34, respectively. High concentrations of tested EOs showed a decrease in antioxidative ‎ activity.">

In terms of individual effects, antibacterial effect of &lt;i&gt;M. longifolia&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C. cyminum&lt;/i&gt; essential oils were the highest against methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Y. enterocolitica,&lt;/i&gt; respectively. The antibacterial effects of sodium benzoate combined with essential oils showed significant differences with the individual effect of sodium benzoate in most cases. The results indicated that the combined effect of these essential oils with sodium benzoate could reduce the use of sodium benzoate as an antimicrobial agent, which could decrease its possible side effects. Thus, for more significant effects, these essential oils could be combined with other agents for the preservation of drug and food products.">

The LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (lethal concentration to kill 50% of tested insects) values of the oral and fumigant bioassays of &lt;i&gt;A. annua&lt;/i&gt; essential oil were 1.204 % W/V and 3.343 μL/L air, respectively. The &lt;i&gt;A. annua&lt;/i&gt; essential oil&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; rich in camphor, artemisia ketone, β-selinene, pinocarvone, 1,8-cineole, and α-pinene, caused a significant reduction in digestive and detoxifying enzyme activity of &lt;i&gt;G. pyloalis&lt;/i&gt; larvae. The contents of protein, glucose, and triglyceride were also reduced in the treated larvae by oral and fumigant treatments. The immune system in treated larvae was weakened after both oral and fumigation applications compared to the control groups.

The southeastern United States also possesses a warm humid climate with a growing demand for locally sourced herbs and spices. In this study, five different varieties of &lt;i&gt;C. longa&lt;/i&gt; were cultivated in north Alabama, the rhizome essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation, and the essential oils were analyzed by gas chromatographic techniques. The major components in the essential oils were α-phellandrene (3.7-11.8%), 1,8-cineole (2.6-11.7%), α-zingiberene (0.8-12.5%), β-sesquiphellandrene (0.7-8.0%), &lt;i&gt;ar&lt;/i&gt;-turmerone (6.8-32.5%), α-turmerone (13.6-31.5%), and β-turmerone (4.8-18.4%).

Up to today, there was no scientific report on wound healing activity. Thus, this study was initiated to evaluate for the first time the antimicrobial activity and wound healing potential of a new chemotype from &lt;i&gt;Piper cubeba&lt;/i&gt; essential oil (PCEO) from fruits. Thirteen microbial strains have been selected to investigate the antimicrobial potential of PCEO. For the evaluation of the wound healing potential, sixteen rats were excised on the dorsal back and divided into four groups. The effect of PCEO on the malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in the healed wound area of rats and the biochemical parameters and skin histological analysis were also assessed. Results: Data showed that PCEO exhibited a powerful antimicrobial potential especially against &lt;i&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;. In addition, the topical application of PCEO cream appears to increase the SOD level, wound healing and contraction but reduced the MDA amount suggesting an impressive and a rapid cutaneous healing power. Additionally, histopathological analysis of the granulation tissue revealed that the derma is properly restored and arranged after treatment with PCEO. The docking analysis of PCEO constituents against &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase enzyme showed binding energies values in the range of -7.2 to -4.8 kcal/mol. In conclusion, the topic use of PCEO healing cream showed significant effect in accelerating the healing process, which may be attributed to the synergetic effect of antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of PCEO volatile constituents, making it a relevant therapeutic agent for the management of wounds and therefore confirming the popular traditional uses of this plant.">

The plant species of this genus have been widely used in folk medicine for the treatment of several ailments, such as rheumatic pain, bronchial asthma, tumors in the joints, intestinal worms, halitosis, ulcers, and multiple infections, due to their pharmacological activity. This review presents an updated and comprehensive summary of &lt;i&gt;Virola&lt;/i&gt; species, particularly their ethnomedicinal uses, phytochemistry, and biological activity, to support the safe medicinal use of plant extracts and provide guidance for future research. The &lt;i&gt;Virola&lt;/i&gt; spp.'s ethnopharmacology, including in the treatment of stomach pain and gastric ulcers, as well as antimicrobial and tryponosomicidal activities, is attributable to the presence of a myriad of phytoconstituents, such as flavonoids, tannins, phenolic acids, lignans, arylalkanones, and sitosterol. Hence, such species yield potential leads or molecular scaffolds for the development of new pharmaceutical formulations, encouraging the elucidation of not-yet-understood action mechanisms and ascertaining their safety for humans.">

We investigated DM as a natural capping agent for Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions and coloaded it with tryptophan for its penetration and antiobesity behavior. DM zinc oxide nanoparticles (DM-ZnO NPs) were prepared and then entrapped with tryptophan (DM-ZnO-Try nanoemulsion (NE)) for stable formulation using the O/W nanoemulsion method. The hydrodynamic sizes measured by dynamic light scattering for DM-ZnO NPs and DM-ZnO-Try NE are about 146.26 ± 3.31 and 151.16 ± 3.59 nm, respectively. TEM and SEM reveal its morphology. In vitro analysis on both NPs and NE was non-toxic to RAW 264.7 and 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line. It significantly reduced the accumulated lipids through lipolysis performed at 10 ug/mL in 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells. NE suppresses the differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes and lowers triglycerides. Further, the substantial reduction of lipid content is evident with Oil Red O staining and OD measurement. In this present study, the synergetic effect of DM-ZnO NPs and tryptophan is reported, which provides a way for more detailed research on its efficacy for obesity and obesity-associated disorders.">

The present study aimed to evaluate the chemical composition and apoptotic activity of &lt;i&gt;Ferula macrecolea&lt;/i&gt; essential oil (FMEO) as well as its in vitro and ex vivo protoscolicidal effects against hydatid cyst protoscoleces.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis was performed to determine the chemical composition of FMEO. Protoscoleces of hydatid cysts were collected from liver fertile hydatid cysts of infected sheep and were then treated with various concentrations of the essential oil (75, 150, and 300 µL/mL) for 5-60 min in vitro and ex vivo. Then, by using the eosin exclusion test, the viability of the protoscoleces was studied. The caspase-3-like activity of the FMEO-treated protoscoleces was also evaluated through the colorimetric protease assay Sigma Kit based on the manufacturer's instructions.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;According to GC/MS, the main constituents of the essential oil were terpinolene (77.72%), n-nonanal (4.47%), and linalool (4.35%), respectively. In vitro, the maximum protoscolicidal activity of FMEO was observed at the concentrations of 150 and 300 µL/mL, such that 100% of the protoscoleces were killed after 30 and 20 min of exposure, respectively. Based on the obtained findings, the results demonstrate that FMEO required a longer time to kill protoscoleces ex vivo; after 12 min of exposure to FMEO, only 13.4% of the protoscoleces remained alive. After 48 h of the treatment of protoscoleces, FMEO, in a dose-dependent manner and at doses of 75, 150, and 300 µL/mL, induced the activation of the caspase enzyme by 24.3, 35.3, and 48.3%, respectively.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Our findings demonstrate the potent protoscolicidal effects of FMEO in vitro and ex vivo; however, further studies are required to assess the safety and the efficiency of FMEO as a promising scolicidal agent in a preclinical model and clinical setting.">

The entire &lt;i&gt;Moringa oleifera&lt;/i&gt; plant is edible, including its flowers, however, it is not entirely safe, because of compounds that have been found mainly in the root and bark, so the leaf was identified as the safest. &lt;i&gt;Moringa oleifera&lt;/i&gt; is recognised as an excellent source of phytochemicals, with potential applications in functional and medicinal food preparations due to its nutritional and medicinal properties; many authors have experimented with incorporating it mainly in biscuits, cakes, brownies, meats, juices and sandwiches. The results are fascinating, as the products increase their nutritional value; however, the concentrations cannot be high, as this affects the organoleptic characteristics of the supplemented products. The aim of this study is to review the application of &lt;i&gt;Moringa oleifera&lt;/i&gt; in bakery products, which will allow the creation of new products that improve their nutritional and functional value.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Piper carpunya&lt;/i&gt; Ruiz &amp; Pav. is an aromatic shrub native to Ecuador, the leaves of which are used to prepare the traditional beverage Guaviduca. Different health benefits are attributed to the guaviduca beverage, which is consumed as a traditional and folk medicine. In this study, fresh &lt;i&gt;P. carpunya&lt;/i&gt; leaves were collected in the winter and summer and subjected to hydrodistillation for the extraction of the essential oil. The guaviduca beverage was prepared by infusion in water and the volatile compounds were isolated by liquid-liquid extraction. Chemical composition and enantioselective analyses were performed by gas chromatography. The antibacterial activity was assayed against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The scavenging radical properties of the essential oil was evaluated by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydryl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) assays. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity was measured using the spectrophotometric method. The chemical analysis allowed us to identify more than 98% of the compounds in all samples. The main constituent of the essential oil was 1,8-cineole (25.20 ± 1.31%) in &lt;i&gt;P. carpunya&lt;/i&gt; collected in winter and (17.45 ± 2.33%) in &lt;i&gt;P. carpunya&lt;/i&gt; collected in summer, while in the beverage, there was 14 mg/L. Safrole was identified in the essential oil (PCW 21.91 ± 2.79%; PCS 13.18 ± 1.72%) as well as in the beverage (2.43 ± 0.12 mg/L). Enantioselective analysis was used to investigate the enantiomeric ratio and excess of four chiral components. The essential oil presented a strong activity against &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; with a MIC of 500 μg/mL and a very strong anticholinesterase activity with an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 36.42 ± 1.15 µg/mL.">

In this study, we investigated three aromatic plant species with the aim of finding valuable sources of antimicrobial agents against common pathogenic microorganisms. We focused especially on microorganisms, which cause outbreaks of infectious disease during mass gatherings and pilgrimages season in Saudi Arabia. The essential oils of three aromatic plant species were hydrodistilled from flowering aerial parts of &lt;i&gt;Lavandula pubescens&lt;/i&gt; Decne. and &lt;i&gt;Pulicaria incisa&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;candolleana&lt;/i&gt; E.Gamal-Eldin, and from leaves, stems, ripe and unripe fruits of &lt;i&gt;Juniperus procera&lt;/i&gt; Hochst. Ex Endl. They were subsequently analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The main constituents of &lt;i&gt;L. pubescens&lt;/i&gt; were found to be carvacrol (55.7%), methyl carvacrol (13.4%), and β-bisabolene (9.1%). &lt;i&gt;P. incisa&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;Candolleana&lt;/i&gt; essential oil was rich in linalool (33.0%), chrysanthenone (10.3%), eugenol (8.9%), and &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-chrysanthenol (8.0%); the major components of &lt;i&gt;J. procera&lt;/i&gt; essential oil were α-pinene (31.3-62.5%) and δ-3-carene (7.3-30.3%). These essential oils were tested against thirteen American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria using the agar diffusion assay. The only effective essential oil was that of &lt;i&gt;L. pubescens&lt;/i&gt; and the most sensitive strains were &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella sonnei&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus faecalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus epidermidis&lt;/i&gt;. Carvacrol, the major constituent of &lt;i&gt;L. pubescens&lt;/i&gt;, was tested on these strains and was compared with vancomycin, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) assays of &lt;i&gt;L. pubescens&lt;/i&gt; essential oil and carvacrol revealed that Gram-negative strains were more susceptible than the Gram-positive ones.">

As per the current scenario, there is an urgent need for antiviral that could act as a protective and therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2. Previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is much similar to the SARS-CoV bat that occurred in 2002-03. Since it is a zoonotic virus, the exact source is still unknown, but it is believed bats may be the primary reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 through which it has been transferred to humans. In this review, we have tried to summarize some of the approaches that could be effective against SARS-CoV-2. Firstly, plants or plant-based products have been effective against different viral diseases, and secondly, plants or plant-based natural products have the minimum adverse effect. We have also highlighted a few vitamins and minerals that could be beneficial against SARS-CoV-2.">

The chemical composition of essential oils was determined by GC-MS and GC-FID, while extracts (phenolic acids and flavonoids fractions) were analyzed by HPLC-DAD. Based on given volatiles, the investigated subspecies represented two chemotypes: a carvacrol/γ-terpinene/&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-cymene type in the case of Greek oregano and a sabinyl/cymyl type rich in terpinen-4-ol in common oregano. Within non-volatile phenolic compounds, rosmarinic acid appeared to dominate in both subspecies. Lithospermic acid B, chlorogenic acid and isovitexin were present only in Greek oregano extracts. However, the total content of flavonoids was higher in common oregano extracts. The essential oil and extract of Greek oregano revealed visibly stronger antibacterial activity (expressed as MIC and MBC) than common oregano, whereas the antioxidant potential (determined by DPPH, ABTS and FRAP) of these extracts was almost equal for both subspecies. In the case of &lt;i&gt;Origanum&lt;/i&gt; plants, the potential application of essential oils and extracts as antiseptic and antioxidant agents in the food industry should be preceded by subspecies identification followed by recognition of their chemotype concerning both terpene and phenolics composition.">

The purpose of this study was to explore in vitro antioxidant, thrombolytic activities, and in vivo neuropharmacological effects of methanolic extract of &lt;i&gt;Homalomena aromatica&lt;/i&gt; (MEHA) leaves. Antioxidant activity of MEHA was assessed by a DPPH free radical scavenging assay and total phenolics content, total flavonoids content were also measured. The thrombolytic activity was determined by percentage of clot lysis and neuropharmacological activities by hole board, tail suspension, forced swimming and elevated plus maze tests. The results showed that the IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of the extract against DPPH was 199.51 μg/mL. Quantitative analysis displayed higher contents of phenolics and flavonoids (147.71 mg gallic acid equivalent/g &amp; 66.65 mg quercetin equivalent/g dried extract, respectively). The extract also showed a significant clot lysis (33.31%) activity. In case of anxiolytic activity, the elevate plus maze (EPM) test demonstrated an increase in time spent in open arms, and in case of hole board test, the number of head dipping was also significantly increased (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05). All the test compared with control (1% Tween in water) and standard (diazepam 1 mg/kg), significant dose (200 &amp; 400 mg/kg) dependent anxiolytic activity was found. In antidepressant activity, there was a significant decrease in period of immobility in both test models (tail suspension and forced swimming) (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05). Moreover, 13 compounds were identified as bioactive, showed good binding affinities to xanthine oxidoreductase, tissue plasminogen activator receptor, potassium channel receptor, human serotonin receptor targets in molecular docking experiments. Furthermore, ADME/T analysis revealed their drug-likeness, likely pharmacological actions and non-toxic upon consumption. Taken together, our finding support the traditional medicinal use of this plant, which may provide a potential source for future drug discovery.">

India, China, Thailand, Indonesia, Pakistan, Mexico, Brazil, Bangladesh, Nigeria, and the Philippines are among the top mango producer countries. Leaves of the mango plant have been studied for their health benefits, which are attributed to a plethora of phytochemicals such as mangiferin, followed by phenolic acids, benzophenones, and other antioxidants such as flavonoids, ascorbic acid, carotenoids, and tocopherols. The extracts from mango leaves (MLs) have been studied for their biological activities, including anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, anti-oxidant, anti-microbial, anti-obesity, lipid-lowering, hepato-protection, and anti-diarrheal. In the present review, we have elaborated on the nutritional and phytochemical profile of the MLs. Further, various bioactivities of the ML extracts are also critically discussed. Considering the phytochemical profile and beneficial effects of the MLs, they can be used as a potential ingredient for the development of functional foods and pharmaceutical drugs. However, more detailed clinical trials still needed to be conducted for establishing the actual efficacy of the ML extracts.">

Relatively high amounts of oxygenated sesquiterpenes (44.4-70.2%) were detected, mainly consisting of caryophyllene oxide (13.1-26.6%), carotol (9.2-21.2%),14-hydroxy-9-&lt;i&gt;epi&lt;/i&gt;-(&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-caryophyllene (3.2-15.5%) and humulene epoxide II (2.6-7.2%). The cytotoxic activity against human mammary carcinoma cell lines (MDA-MB-231) and colorectal carcinoma cell lines (SW620) of the essential oil and its fractions were assessed. All the samples displayed moderate to weak activity compared to 5-fluorouracil. The colorectal carcinoma cell line was relatively more sensitive to the essential oil and its fractions compared to the breast cancer cell line, showing IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values from 25.7 to 96.5 μg/mL. In addition, the essential oil and its fraction E.2 revealed a cytotoxic activity against colorectal carcinoma cell line, with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values lower than 30 μg/mL.

Results of oregano and thyme EOs combination showed additive effects against all &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; strains in both phases. In several cases, sums of FICs were lower than 0.6, which can be considered a strong additive interaction. The lowest FICs obtained were 0.53 in the liquid phase and 0.59 in the gaseous phase.

The neuroprotective and anti-ageing potentials of essential oils (EOs) are widely evaluated around the globe. The objective of this review is to analyse the effectiveness of EOs as neuroprotective remedies among the four common age-related neurodegenerative diseases. The literature was extracted from three databases (PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar) between the years of 2010 to 2020 using the medical subject heading (MeSH) terms &quot;essential oil&quot;, crossed with &quot;Alzheimer's disease (AD)&quot;, &quot;Huntington's disease (HD)&quot;, &quot;Parkinson's disease (PD)&quot; or &quot;amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)&quot;. Eighty three percent (83%) of the studies were focused on AD, while another 12% focused on PD. No classifiable study was recorded on HD or ALS. EO from &lt;i&gt;Salvia officinalis&lt;/i&gt; has been recorded as one of the most effective acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors. However, only &lt;i&gt;Cinnamomum&lt;/i&gt; sp. has been assessed for its effectiveness in both AD and PD.

HL-60R cell lines are characterized by the overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) and constitutive expression of NF-κB. EO chemical composition was determined by GC/MS analysis; cytotoxic activity of EO by MTS assay alone or in combination with doxorubicin; pro-apoptotic effect and doxorubicin accumulation were analyzed by flow cytometry; P-gp ATPase activity was measured by P-gp-Glo™ assay systems kit. The ability to inhibit NF-κB and its target genes was also assessed. &lt;i&gt;E. intisy&lt;/i&gt; EO exhibited a comparable cytotoxic effect and ability to block P-gp in both the HL-60 and its MDR variant HL-60R. In addition, EO suppressed P-gp protein expression and significantly downregulated MDR1 mRNA level, as well as some IAPs proteins, probably through the inhibition of NF-κB.

Although the plant has been used to enhance memory, the investigational evidence supporting the nootropic effect was unsubstantial. Hence, the rationale for this study was to assess the potential beneficial effect of &lt;i&gt;F. ammoniacum&lt;/i&gt; seed extracts on learning and memory in mice.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;The powdered plant samples (aerial parts) were subjected to extraction ad fractionation. Among the extracts, crude and ethyl acetate extracts were screened for major phytochemicals through HPLC analysis. All the extracts were evaluated for the in vitro anticholinesterase (AChE and BChE) and antioxidant potentials. Among the extracts the active fraction was further assessed for improving learning and memory in mice using behavioural tests like Y-maze and novel object recognition test (NORT) using standard protocols. After behavioural tests, all the animals were sacrificed and brains tissues were assessed for the ex vivo anticholinesterase and antioxidant potentials.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Phytochemicals like chlorogenic acid, quercetin, mandelic acid, phloroglucinol, hydroxy benzoic acid, malic acid, epigallocatechin gallate, ellagic acid, rutin, and pyrogallol were identified in crude methanolic extract (Fa.Met) and ethyl acetate fraction (Fa.EtAc) through HPLC. Fa.EtAc and Fa.Chf extracts more potently inhibited AChE and BChE with IC50 values of 40 and 43 µg/mL, and 41 and 42 µg/mL, respectively. Similarly highest free radical scavenging potential was exhibited by Fa.EtAc fraction against DPPH (IC50 = 100 µg/mL) and ABTS (IC50 = 120 µg/mL). The extract doses, 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight significantly (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.01) improved the short-term memory by increasing the percent spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze test along with increasing discrimination index in the NORT that clearly indicated the enhancement in the recognition memory of mice.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The extracts more potently scavenged the tested free radicals, exhibited anticholinesterase activities, improved the learning abilities and reduced the memory impairment induced by scopolamine in mice model thus suggesting that these extracts could be effectively used for the management of oxidative stress, neurodegenerative diseases and memory loss.">

        <span class="abst" title="The cannabis plant (&lt;i&gt;Cannabis sativa&lt;/i&gt; L.) produces an estimated 545 chemical compounds of different biogenetic classes. In addition to economic value, many of these phytochemicals have medicinal and physiological activity. The plant is most popularly known for its two most-prominent and most-studied secondary metabolites-Δ&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;-THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). Both Δ&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;-THC and CBD have a wide therapeutic window across many ailments and form part of a class of secondary metabolites called cannabinoids-of which approximately over 104 exist. This review will focus on non-cannabinoid metabolites of &lt;i&gt;Cannabis sativa&lt;/i&gt; that also have therapeutic potential, some of which share medicinal properties similar to those of cannabinoids. The most notable of these non-cannabinoid phytochemicals are flavonoids and terpenes. We will also discuss future directions in cannabis research and development of cannabis-based pharmaceuticals. Caflanone, a flavonoid molecule with selective activity against the human viruses including the coronavirus OC43 (HCov-OC43) that is responsible for COVID-19, and certain cancers, is one of the most promising non-cannabinoid molecules that is being advanced into clinical trials. As validated by thousands of years of the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes, vast anecdotal evidence abounds on the medicinal benefits of the plant. These benefits are attributed to the many phytochemicals in this plant, including non-cannabinoids. The most promising non-cannabinoids with potential to alleviate global disease burdens are discussed.">

        <span class="abst" title="Medicinal plants and their derived compounds have drawn the attention of researchers due to their considerable impact on human health. Among medicinal plants, mint (&lt;i&gt;Mentha&lt;/i&gt; species) exhibits multiple health beneficial properties, such as prevention from cancer development and anti-obesity, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, and cardioprotective effects, as a result of its antioxidant potential, combined with low toxicity and high efficacy. &lt;i&gt;Mentha&lt;/i&gt; species are widely used in savory dishes, food, beverages, and confectionary products. Phytochemicals derived from mint also showed anticancer activity against different types of human cancers such as cervix, lung, breast and many others. Mint essential oils show a great cytotoxicity potential, by modulating MAPK and PI3k/Akt pathways; they also induce apoptosis, suppress invasion and migration potential of cancer cells lines along with cell cycle arrest, upregulation of Bax and p53 genes, modulation of TNF, IL-6, IFN-γ, IL-8, and induction of senescence phenotype. Essential oils from mint have also been found to exert antibacterial activities against &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;, and many others. The current review highlights the antimicrobial role of mint-derived compounds and essential oils with a special emphasis on anticancer activities, clinical data and adverse effects displayed by such versatile plants.">

Scientific data supporting the efficacy of EOs as anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and antioxidant molecules accumulates over time; however, the cumulative evidence is not always sufficient. EOs antioxidant properties have been investigated mainly from human perspectives. Still, so far, our review is the first to combine the beneficial supporting properties of EOs in a One Health approach and as an animal product quality enhancer, opening new possibilities for their utilization in the livestock and nutrition sectors. We aim to compile the currently available data on the main anti-inflammatory effects of EOs, whether encapsulated or not, with a focus on mammary gland inflammation. We will also review the EOs' antioxidant activities when given in the diet or as a food preservative to counteract oxidative stress. We emphasize EOs' in vitro and in vivo ruminal microbiota and mechanisms of action to promote animal health and performance. Given the concept of DOHaD (Developmental Origin of Health and Diseases), supplementing animals with EOs in early life opens new perspectives in the nutrition sector. However, effective evaluation of the significant safety components is required before extending their use to livestock and veterinary medicine.">

Thirteen other known compounds involving allantoin (1) were either isolated or identified. GC-MS enabled the identification of six compounds from a fraction containing essential oil. MeOH extract and some isolated compounds were tested in vitro against Pf7G8 CQS and Pf Dd2 CQR strains of Plasmodium falciparum; extract disclosed a moderate antiplasmodial activity (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 50 μg mL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). Meantime, the CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; extract and essential oil fraction were tested on a resistant mycobacterial strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis; a potent antimycobacterial activity with a MIC = 9.52 μg mL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; was deduced from essential oil. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried on batesiin (2). Calculated chemical shifts at B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) and MPW1PW91/6-31G+(d,p) showed much better correlations with the experimental data. Time dependent DFT at B3LYP/6-31G+(d,p) displayed a major absorption band 3.01 nm higher than the experimental value.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Cordia batesii can be considered as promising in search of compounds with antimalarial and antitubercular properties. DFT studies are very helpful when trying to learn more about the spectroscopic insights of a derivative of allantoin (1).">

A total of six hundred 1-day-old male broiler chickens were randomly allocated into 5 treatment groups with 8 replicate pens, and each pen contained 15 birds. The experiment lasted for 42 d. Dietary treatments included corn-soybean meal-based diet supplemented with 0, 250, 500, 750, and 1,000 mg/kg EEO. The results indicated that dietary treatments had no effect on growth performance parameters in the 1 to 10 d period. From day 11 to 24, dietary supplementation of EEO showed a linear decrease in feed conversion ratio (FCR, P &lt; 0.05). From day 25 to 42 and the overall period (1-42 d), broilers fed with different levels of EEO showed a linear increase in body weight gain (BWG) and reduction in feed conversion ratio (linear, P &lt; 0.05). The relative organ weight were unaffected by any of the dietary treatments. With increasing levels of EEO, the cecal Escherichia coli (linear, P = 0.085) count showed a trend in reduction, and the cecal lactic acid bacteria population tended to increase (linear, P = 0.063). The apparent ileal digestibility of ether extract and organic matter were linearly and quadratically increased in response to increasing dietary EEO supplementation (P &lt; 0.05). A trend of linear decrease in total cholesterol in the serum of birds fed with different levels of EEO was recorded (P = 0.074). Eucalyptus essential oil's inclusion increased serum superoxide dismutase linearly but reduced serum malondialdehyde linearly (P &lt; 0.05). Dietary supplementation of EEO affected the fatty acid profile of thigh muscle so that increased the concentrations of total polyunsaturated fatty acids (linear, P &lt; 0.05) and reduced total saturated fatty acid contents (linear, P &lt; 0.05). Taken together, the inclusion of EEO increased BWG and decreased FCR during day 25 to 42 and day 1 to 42, and partially improved cecal microflora balance, nutrient digestibility, antioxidant activity, and thigh muscle fatty acid profile in broiler chickens.">

The present paper reviews advances in research relating to the botany, ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, pharmacology, and toxicology of Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens. In addition, this review also discusses some significant issues and the potential direction of future research on Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens. More than 100 chemical compounds have been isolated from Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens, including gingerols, essential oils, diarylheptanoids, and other compounds. Modern studies have confirmed that Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens has pharmacological effects on the nervous system and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems, as well as antiemetic, antibacterial, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects. However, the modern studies of Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens are still not complete and more bioactive components and potential pharmacological effects need to be explored in the future. There is no unified standard to evaluate the quality and clinical efficacy of Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens. Therefore, we should establish reasonable, accurate, and reliable quality control standards to make better use of Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens.">

        <span class="abst" title="Agarwood is known to have a sedative effect and the less studied volatile aromatic constituents it contains may have contribution to the activity. In this study, two &lt;i&gt;Kyara&lt;/i&gt; grade (highest-grade agarwood in Japan) samples were extracted using headspace-solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and analyzed through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Six low molecular weight aromatic compounds (LACs) and one structurally simple compound (diethylene glycol monoethyl ether) present in the aromas were individually evaluated for inhalational sedative activity in mice through open field test. Doses of 0.0001 g/L to 1 g/L were prepared for each compound and administered to mice (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 6/dose/compound). Results revealed all compounds decreased spontaneous motor activity at almost all doses. Strongest sedative activity of each compound reduced total spontaneous motor activity by more than half against control, demonstrating their contribution to agarwood aroma and potential as independent sedating agents. Mixtures of compounds using their most effective dose were made and evaluated again for inhalational sedative effect. Interestingly, the combination of all compounds showed no significant effect and even caused stimulation in mice movements. This result suggests antagonistic-like interaction between the compounds, which is probably due to structural similarities. Consequently, it implies the other constituents present in agarwood, along with LACs, are also important to the overall sedative activity.">

It was also one of the most economically important and culturally valuable plants. But nowadays, it is not adequately available in the country due to deforestation problem in the years. In addition, its economic importance, current status, and medicinal roles are not well documented and understood. As for research studies, it is concluded that unless a collective effort is taken, the existence of this plant is under severe threat and needs to have some measures.

Hence, this review is an effort to retrieve the traditional usage of Cannabis sativa as a phytomedicine from published ethnomedicinal studies.&lt;h4&gt;Methods and materials&lt;/h4&gt;Information was searched by using the search terms &quot;ethnomedicinal Cannabis sativa and Bangladesh&quot;; &quot;Bangladesh cannabaceae and ethnomedicinal survey&quot;; &quot;ganja, bhang and folk medicine Bangladesh&quot;; &quot;tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabinoid and therapeutic, clinical trial&quot;; and &quot;cannabis and pharmacological/biological&quot; and retrieved from ethnobotanical articles available on PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and Google Scholar databases. A search of the relevant scientific literature also was conducted to assess the efficacy of the ethnomedicinal usage of Cannabis sativa.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;While reviewing over 200 ethnomedicinal plants' survey articles, we found that FMPs of Bangladesh from 12 different districts used Cannabis sativa to treat cited ailments like sleep-associated problems (n=5), neuropsychiatric and CNS problems (n=5), and infections and respiratory problems (n=5) followed by rheumatism, gastrointestinal, gynecological (n=4 each), cancer, sexual, and other ailments including hypertension, headache, itch, increases bile secretion, abortifacient, dandruff, fever, and urinary problems (n=1 each). There are a total of 15 formulations identified from the 11 out of 18 ethnomedicinal plant survey reports. The leaf was the main plant part used (53.8%), followed by root (23%), seed (7.7%) and flower, inflorescence, resin, and all parts 3.8% respectively.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Sales and cultivation of Cannabis are illegal at present in Bangladesh, but the use of Cannabis sativa as a natural phytomedicine has been practiced traditionally by folk medicine practitioners of Bangladesh for many years and validated through relevant pharmacological justification. Although Cannabis sativa possesses ethnomedicinal properties in the folk medicine of Bangladesh, it is, furthermore, needed to conduct biological research to consolidate pharmacological justification about the prospects and challenges of Cannabis and cannabinoids' use in Bangladesh as safer biomedicine in the future.">

Recently, however, the ECS has been extensively implicated in the cardiovascular system with contractility, heart rate, blood pressure, and vasodilation. Emerging data demonstrate modulation of the ECS plays an essential role in cardio metabolic risk, atherosclerosis, and can even limit damage to cardiomyocytes during ischemic events.&lt;h4&gt;Patient concerns&lt;/h4&gt;This case describes a 63-year-old man who presented to a primary care physician for a medical cannabis (MC) consult due to unstable angina (UA) not relieved by morphine or cardiac medications; having failed all first- and second-line polypharmaceutical therapies. The patient reported frequent, unprovoked, angina and exertional dyspnea.&lt;h4&gt;Diagnosis&lt;/h4&gt;Having a complex cardiac history, the patient first presented 22 years ago after a suspected myocardial infarction. He re-presented in 2010 and underwent stent placement at that time for inoperable triple-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) which was identified via percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. UA developed on follow-up and, despite medical management over the past 6 years, became progressively debilitating.&lt;h4&gt;Interventions and outcomes&lt;/h4&gt;In conjunction with his standard cardiac care, patient had a gradual lessening of UA-related pain, including frequency and character, after using an edible form of MC (1:1 cannabidiol:Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol). Following continued treatment, he ceased long-term morphine treatment and described the pain as no longer crippling. As demonstrated by his exercise tolerance tests, the patient experienced an improved functional capacity and reported an increase in his daily functioning, and overall activity.&lt;h4&gt;Lessons&lt;/h4&gt;This case uniquely highlights MC in possibly reducing the character, quality, and frequency of UA, whereas concordantly improving functional cardiac capacity in a patient with CAD.

This condition affects a lot of women worldwide and is accompanied with absenteeism and high economic costs, thus, risk-free, and effective therapeutic approaches are needed. Pharmacological agents such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), which are widely prescribed for these women, demonstrate adequate efficacy in alleviating pain and discomfort. The long natural course of the disease dictates remedies that focus on lifestyle changes and on improvement of Quality-of-Life (QoL) for women suffering with PD.&lt;h4&gt;Materials and methods&lt;/h4&gt;Five major search engines, namely MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched for articles published prior to October 2020 focused in PD.

This study aimed to investigate the variability of the chemical composition and the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; antibacterial activity of five essential oils (Eos) originated from Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Syria, India, and France. These five samples were grown under different edaphic and climatic conditions. The agar diffusion method and microdilution method in 96-well plates were used to test the sensitivity of multidrug-resistant strains clinically isolated from patients (methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/i&gt;), for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration and bactericidal concentration. Among all the investigated Eos, the monoterpenes were highly present in the chemical composition. Moroccan, Saudi Arabian, and Syrian seeds were characterized by the presence &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-phellandrene (20.03-30.54%), &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-cymene (12.31-23.82 %), and 4-caranol (9.77-14.27%).

The minimum inhibitory (MIC) and bactericidal concentration (MBC) obtained for the four Eos (with the exception of France because of the low yield) tested were ranging from 3 to 40 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;l/ml. Gram-positive (+) bacteria were slightly sensitive to the Eos tested than the Gram-negative (-) bacteria. The results of this study showed that the Eos of &lt;i&gt;NS&lt;/i&gt; seeds show interesting antibacterial activity which could be associated to the existence of different bioactive compounds. Indeed, these compounds can be used for preventive or curative purposes in the face of the noncontrolled emergence of resistance to antibiotics.">

Further experiments demonstrate that ONP robustly inhibits thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), which leads to perturbation of cellular redox homeostasis with the favor of oxidative stress. Knockdown of the TrxR sensitizes cells to the ONP treatment while overexpression of the enzyme reduces the potency of ONP, underpinning the correlation of TrxR inhibition to the cytotoxicity of ONP. The discovery of ONP expands the library of the natural TrxR inhibitors, and the disclosure of the action mechanism of ONP provides a foundation for the further development of ONP as an anticancer agent.">

In these tissues, enzyme activity was determined by means of spectrophotometer and gene expression by quantitative real-time PCR. mRNA levels of the enzymes were elevated in almost all diet groups compared to the control (D1). It was determined that enzyme activities were also increased in general by supplementation of royal jelly although some decreases were also observed. However, the significant correlation between gene expression and enzyme activity was not observed in all tissues.

The enrichment analysis of the skin transcriptional profile of fish fed the phytogenic-supplemented diet revealed the regulation of genes associated to cellular components involved in the secretory pathway, suggesting the stimulation, and recruitment of phagocytic cells. Genes recognized by their involvement in non-specific immune response were also identified in the analysis. The promotion of the secretion of non-specific immune molecules into the skin mucus was proposed to be involved in the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; decreased growth capacity of pathogenic bacteria in the mucus of fish fed the phytogenic-supplemented diet. Although the mucus antioxidant capacity was not affected by the phytogenics supplementation, the regulation of genes coding for oxidative stress enzymes suggested the reduction of the skin oxidative stress. Additionally, the decreased levels of cortisol in mucus indicated a reduction in the fish allostatic load due to the properties of the tested additive. Altogether, the dietary garlic, carvacrol, and thymol appear to promote the gilthead seabream skin innate immunity and the mucus protective capacity, decreasing its susceptibility to be colonized by pathogenic bacteria.">

        <span class="abst" title="The current pandemic has caused chaos throughout the world. While there are few vaccines available now, there is the need for better treatment alternatives in line with preventive measures against COVID-19. Along with synthetic chemical compounds, phytochemicals cannot be overlooked as candidates for drugs against severe respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The important role of secondary metabolites or phytochemical compounds against coronaviruses has been confirmed by studies that reported the anti-coronavirus role of glycyrrhizin from the roots of &lt;i&gt;Glycyrrhiza glabra&lt;/i&gt;. The study demonstrated that glycyrrhizin is a very promising phytochemical against SARS-CoV, which caused an outbreak in 2002-2003. Similarly, many phytochemical compounds (apigenin, betulonic acid, reserpine, emodin, etc.) were isolated from different plants such as &lt;i&gt;Isatis indigotica&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Lindera aggregate&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Artemisia annua&lt;/i&gt; and were employed against SARS-CoV. However, owing to the geographical and seasonal variation, the quality of standard medicinal compounds isolated from plants varies. Furthermore, many of the important medicinal plants are either threatened or on the verge of endangerment because of overharvesting for medicinal purposes. Therefore, plant biotechnology provides a better alternative in the form of &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; culture technology, including plant cell cultures, adventitious roots cultures, and organ and tissue cultures. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; cultures can serve as factories of secondary metabolites/phytochemicals that can be produced in bulk and of uniform quality in the fight against COVID-19, once tested. Similarly, environmental and molecular manipulation of these &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; cultures could provide engineered drug candidates for testing against COVID-19. The &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; culture-based phytochemicals have an additional benefit of consistency in terms of yield as well as quality. Nonetheless, as the traditional plant-based compounds might prove toxic in some cases, engineered production of promising phytochemicals can bypass this barrier. Our article focuses on reviewing the potential of the different &lt;i&gt;in vitro plant&lt;/i&gt; cultures to produce medicinally important secondary metabolites that could ultimately be helpful in the fight against COVID-19.">

        <span class="abst" title="Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a gradually growing irreversible illness of the brain that almost affects every fifth person (aged &gt; 80 years) in the world. World Health Organization (WHO) also revealed that the prevalence of this disease will enhance (upto double) significantly upto 2030. The poor cholinergic transmission at the synapse is considered to be one of the main reasons behind the progression and occurrence of this disorder. Natural inhibitors of acetylcholine (ACh) such as galanthamine and rivastigmine are used commercially in the treatmentof AD. The biomolecules such assesquiterpenes, possess a great structural diversity and are responsible for a plethora of pharmacological properties. The potential of various sesquiterpenes as anticholinesterase has been reviewed in this article. For this purpose, the various databases, mainly PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were investigatedwith different keywords such as &quot;sesquiterpenes+acetylcholinesterase&quot; and &quot;sesquiterpenes+cholinesterase+inhibitors&quot; in the surveyed time frame (2010-2020). A vast literature was evident in the last decade, which affirms the potential of various sesquiterpenes in the improvement of cholinergic transmission by inhibiting the AChE. After data analysis, it was found that 12 compounds out of a total of 58 sesquiterpenes were reported to possess IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 9μM and can be considered as potential candidates for the improvement of learning and memory. Sesquiterpene is an important category of terpenoids, found to possess a large spectrum of biological activities. The outcome of the review clearly states that sesquiterpenes (such as amberboin, lipidiol,etc) from herbs could offer fresh, functional compounds for possible prevention and treatment of AD.">

Forty-five hypertensive volunteers of both genders participated in a placebo-controlled clinical trial. The volunteers were submitted to 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, analysis of blood pressure variability (BPV), measurement of serum malondialdehyde (MDA) and nutritional assessment. Results indicate that EVCO consumption had no adverse effects. The supplementation did not increase the caloric intake compared with placebo, and the dietary constituents were similar between groups, except for the saturated fats, especially lauric acid. The analysis of blood pressure indicated absence of antihypertensive effect of EVCO alone or combined with physical training. Furthermore, no effects on blood pressure variability and oxidative stress were observed in the supplemented hypertensive patients. Thus, despite the results observed in pre-clinical studies, the current clinical study did not provide evidence to support the use of coconut oil as an adjuvant in the management of hypertension in humans.">

The plant is used in Chinese and Ayurvedic systems of medicine for its antiviral, antifungal, antimicrobial, insecticidal, hepatoprotective and neuroprotective properties. Research based studies point to Artemisia's role in addressing an entire gamut of physiological imbalances through a unique combination of pharmacological actions. Terpenoids, flavonoids, coumarins, caffeoylquinic acids, sterols and acetylenes are some of the major phytochemicals of the genus. Notable among the phytochemicals is artemisinin and its derivatives (ARTs) that represent a new class of recommended drugs due to the emergence of bacteria and parasites that are resistant to quinoline drugs. This manuscript aims to systematically review recent studies that have investigated artemisinin and its derivatives not only for their potent antiviral actions but also their utility against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). &lt;i&gt;Materials and&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods&lt;/i&gt;: PubMed Central, Scopus and Google scholar databases of published articles were collected and abstracts were reviewed for relevance to the subject matter. &lt;i&gt;Conclusions&lt;/i&gt;: The unprecedented impact that artemisinin had on public health and drug discovery research led the Nobel Committee to award the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2015 to the discoverers of artemisinin. Thus, it is clear that Artemisia's importance in indigenous medicinal systems and drug discovery systems holds great potential for further investigation into its biological activities, especially its role in viral infection and inflammation.">

Nanoencapsulation is a technique based on enclosing a bioactive compound (BAC) in liquid, solid or gaseous states within a matrix or inert material for preserving the coated substance (food or flavor molecules/ingredients). Nanoencapsulation can improve stability of BACs, improving the regulation of their release at physiologically active sites. Regarding materials for food and nutraceutical applications, the most used are carbohydrate-, protein- or lipid-based alternatives such as chitosan, peptide-chitosan and β-lactoglobulin nanoparticles (NPs) or emulsion biopolymer complexes.

The caraway essential oil is incorporated in the polypropylene by a thermoplastic processing method. Analysis of the morphology of the composites was carried out by scanning electron microscopy. The chemical composition of the caraway essential oil in addition to its efficiency of incorporation and release were evaluated by GC/MS and Pyrolysis-GC/MS techniques, respectively. Determination was made as to the influence of such incorporation on thermal and tensile properties of the samples, while antibacterial activity was evaluated through conducting disk diffusion tests and measurement with adherence to the ISO 22196:2011 standard. It was found that incorporating the caraway essential oil in the samples did not affect the homogeneity of the thermoplastic-processed composites at any studied concentration. Stress-strain analysis confirmed the plasticizing effect of the essential oil in the polypropylene matrix, in addition to which, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) analysis revealed that the prepared compositions with essential oil exhibited similar thermal properties to neat polypropylene. Results indicated significant antibacterial activity against &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; at the concentration of essential oil of 4.9 ± 0.2 wt% and higher.">

Considering the positive effects of selenium (Se) and chitosan (Cs) separately against abiotic stress, in these experiments, we synthesized chitosan-selenium nanoparticles (Cs-Se NPs) and investigated their ability to reduce the negative effects of salt stress on growth and some biochemical parameters of bitter melon (&lt;i&gt;Momordica charantia&lt;/i&gt;). Bitter melon plants were grown at three NaCl salinity levels (0, 50, and 100 mM) and a foliar spray of Cs-Se NPs (0, 10, and 20 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) was applied. Some key morphological, biochemical, and physiological parameters in leaf samples and essential oil from fruit were measured at harvest. Salinity decreased growth and yield while foliar application of Cs-Se NPs increased these critical parameters. Furthermore, Cs-Se NPs enhanced bitter melon tolerance to salinity by increasing antioxidant enzyme activity, proline concentration, relative water content, and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and decreasing MDA and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; oxidants and Na aggregation in plant tissues. Yield was also improved, as the highest amount of essential oils was produced by plants treated with Cs-Se NPs. Generally, the greatest improvement in measured parameters under saline conditions was obtained by treating plants with 20 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; Cs-Se NPs, which significantly increased salinity tolerance in bitter melon plants.">

Treatment of the latter consists of the off-label use of harmful atypical antipsychotics, though a significant reduction is afforded by pain control. The use of an essential oil endowed with analgesic properties and devoid of toxicity would represent an important option for the management of agitation in dementia. Therefore, the aim of this study was to engineer a nanotechnology delivery system based on solid lipid nanoparticles loaded with bergamot essential oil (BEO) and devised in the pharmaceutical form of an odorless cream (NanoBEO) to confirm its analgesic efficacy for further development and application to control agitation in dementia. BEO has proven strong antinociceptive and anti-allodynic properties and, in its bergapten-free form, it is completely devoid of phototoxicity. NanoBEO has been studied in vivo confirming the previously reported analgesic activity of BEO to which is now added its anti-itching properties. Due to the nanotechnology delivery system, the stability of titrated BEO components is guaranteed. Finally, the latter invention, currently under patent consideration, is smell-devoid allowing efficacy and safety to be established in double-blind clinical trials; until now the latter studies have been impeded in aromatherapy by the strong odor of essential oils. A clinical trial NCT04321889 has been designed to provide information about the efficacy and safety of NanoBEO on agitation and pain in patients suffering from severe dementia.">

Vascular plants in these habitats display different responses to cope with these environmental fluctuations. This work addressed the morpho-anatomical features and chemical responses of two medicinal vascular plant species &lt;i&gt;Artemisia monosperma&lt;/i&gt; Delile and &lt;i&gt;Limbarda crithmoides&lt;/i&gt; (L.) Dumort., growing naturally along the Mediterranean coast of Egypt. Soil properties (physical and chemical), morpho-anatomical features and chemical constituents (secondary metabolites, antioxidant activity and essential oils) for the two species were performed. Our results displayed that both species are surviving where soils are alkaline, high saline with low moisture and organic carbon. The morphology of both species appeared woody low shrub with fleshy leaves. The most marked anatomical attributes were the thick cuticle of the epidermal layer in leaves and stems, compact palisade cells and abundant idioblasts (secretory ducts, phenolic compounds and calcium oxalate). Also, sclerenchymatous pericycle fibers in stem and glandular trichomes on the leaf had appeared in &lt;i&gt;A. monosperma&lt;/i&gt;. Both plants exhibited a considerable content of phenolics, flavonoids, tannins, alkaloids and antioxidant activity with a higher level in &lt;i&gt;A. monosperma&lt;/i&gt; than &lt;i&gt;L. crithmoides&lt;/i&gt;. The leaf extracts of both plants showed higher values than the stem extracts. The sesquiterpenes group were the major identified compounds of the essential oils (EOs) in &lt;i&gt;A. monosperma&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;L. crithmoides&lt;/i&gt;, and the majority were oxygenated sesquiterpenes with percentages of 42.63% and 51.49%, respectively. The second major group of EOs was monoterpenes, which were represented in &lt;i&gt;A. monosperma&lt;/i&gt; in concentrations (34.04%) much higher than those recorded in &lt;i&gt;L. crithmoides&lt;/i&gt; (4.97%). Exploring the local adaptation mechanism used by the target plants helps us to understand how these plants can acclimatize to harsh conditions, and this provides critical insights into the protection and survival strategy of species under extreme conditions.">

Although several efforts have been devoted to identifying these sesquiterpenes, the phytochemical analyses have been performed by gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) where the high temperature employed can promote degradation of the components. In this work, we report the extraction of &lt;i&gt;C. myrrha&lt;/i&gt; by supercritical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, an extraction method known for the mild extraction conditions that allow avoiding undesired chemical reactions during the process.

Moreover, we evaluated the antiviral activity against influenza A virus of the myrrh extracts, that was possible to appreciate after the addition of vitamin E acetate (α-tocopheryl acetate) to the extract. Further, the single main bioactive components of the oil of &lt;i&gt;C. myrrha&lt;/i&gt; commercially available were tested.

The goal of this study was to assess the antimicrobial activity of essential oils' compounds. The qualitative evaluation was carried out by the Kirby Baüer agar diffusion technique in Gram-positive bacteria (11 strains), Gram-negative bacteria (18 strains), and yeasts (8 strains). For the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), the agar dilution method was used. All the evaluated compounds presented antimicrobial activity. The compounds eugenol and carvacrol showed the largest inhibition zones. Regarding yeasts, the compounds ocimene, cineole, and farnesene did not show any activity. The compounds eugenol, carvacrol, and thymol presented the lowest MIC; bactericidal effect was observed at MIC level for &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; 75MR, &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; 128 MR, and &lt;i&gt;C albicans&lt;/i&gt; CUSI, for different compounds, eugenol, carvacrol, and thymol.

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Mentha&lt;/i&gt; species are widely used as food, medicine, spices, and flavoring agents. Thus, chemical composition is an important parameter for assessing the quality of mints. In general, the contents of menthol, menthone, eucalyptol, and limonene comprise one of the major parameters for assessing the quality of commercially important mints. Building further on the phytochemical characterization of the quality of &lt;i&gt;Mentha&lt;/i&gt; species, this work was focused on the composition of phenolic compounds in methanolic extracts. Thirteen &lt;i&gt;Mentha&lt;/i&gt; species were grown under the same environmental conditions, and their methanolic extracts were subjected to the LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry) profiling of phenolics and the testing their biological activities, i.e., antioxidant and tyrosinase inhibition activities, which are important features for the cosmetic industry. The total phenolic content (TPC) ranged from 14.81 ± 1.09 mg GAE (gallic acid equivalents)/g for &lt;i&gt;Mentha cervina&lt;/i&gt; to 58.93. ± 8.39 mg GAE/g for &lt;i&gt;Mentha suaveolens&lt;/i&gt;. The antioxidant activity of examined &lt;i&gt;Mentha&lt;/i&gt; related with the content of the phenolic compounds and ranged from 22.79 ± 1.85 to 106.04 ± 3.26 mg TE (Trolox equivalents)/g for &lt;i&gt;M. cervina&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mentha x villosa&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. Additionally, &lt;i&gt;Mentha pulegium&lt;/i&gt; (123.89 ± 5.64 mg KAE (kojic acid equivalents)/g) and &lt;i&gt;Mentha x piperita&lt;/i&gt; (102.82 ± 15.16 mg KAE/g) showed a strong inhibition of the enzyme tyrosinase, which is related to skin hyperpigmentation. The most abundant compound in all samples was rosmarinic acid, ranging from 1363.38 ± 8323 to 2557.08 ± 64.21 μg/g. In general, the levels of phenolic acids in all examined mint extracts did not significantly differ. On the contrary, the levels of flavonoids varied within the species, especially in the case of hesperidin (from 0.73 ± 0.02 to 109. 39 ± 2.01 μg/g), luteolin (from 1.84 ± 0.11 to 31.03 ± 0.16 μg/g), and kaempferol (from 1.30 ± 0.17 to 33.68 ± 0.81 μg/g). Overall results indicated that all examined mints possess significant amounts of phenolic compounds that are responsible for antioxidant activity and, to some extent, for tyrosinase inhibition activity. Phenolics also proved to be adequate compounds, together with terpenoids, for the characterization of &lt;i&gt;Mentha&lt;/i&gt; sp. Additionally, citrus-scented &lt;i&gt;Mentha&lt;/i&gt; x &lt;i&gt;villosa&lt;/i&gt; could be selected as a good candidate for the food and pharmaceutical industry, especially due its chemical composition and easy cultivation, even in winter continental conditions.">

Research focused on the endocannabinoid system (eCBS) for anxiety and stress regulation, cognitive and emotional responses modulation and aversive memories extinction, leading to the hypothesis that it could represent a possible alternative treatment target for PTSD. In this systematic review, we summarize evidence about the efficacy and safety of medicinal cannabidiol (CBD), Δ&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;-THC), and nabilone in PTSD treatment. The PRISMA statement guidelines were followed. A systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science by two independent researchers, who also performed data extraction and quality assessment. Among the initial 495 papers, 234 were screened for eligibility and 10 were included. Studies suggested that different medicinal cannabinoids at distinct doses and formulations could represent promising treatment strategies for the improvement of overall PTSD symptomatology as well as specific symptom domains (e.g., sleep disorders, arousal disturbances, suicidal thoughts), also influencing quality of life, pain and social impact. Although there is a robust rationale for treatment with drugs that target the eCBS and the results are promising, further studies are needed to investigate the safety and efficacy profile of their prolonged use.">

Plants in this genus play essential roles in communities around the world as revealed by various studies. Currently, there are eight species of the genus &lt;i&gt;Hydnora&lt;/i&gt;; seven in Africa and one in the Arabian Peninsula. Notably, &lt;i&gt;Hydnora abyssinica&lt;/i&gt; A.Br. and &lt;i&gt;Hydnora africana&lt;/i&gt; Thunb. are widely distributed compared to other species. They are widely used for their medicinal and nutritional values. The information on ethnobotany, chemistry, pharmacology, and distribution of genus &lt;i&gt;Hydnora&lt;/i&gt; was gathered using phytochemical and ethnobotanical books, electronic sources, and published articles. Preliminary phytochemical screening shows that flavonoids, phenolics, proanthocyanidins, and tannins are the main compounds in &lt;i&gt;H. abyssinica&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;H. africana&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, 11 compounds have been isolated from &lt;i&gt;H. abyssinica&lt;/i&gt;. The biological activities of &lt;i&gt;H. abyssinica&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;H. africana&lt;/i&gt; have been reported. They include antibacterial, antiproliferative, antioxidant, antidiarrhea, and antifungal potentials. Despite the &lt;i&gt;Hydnora&lt;/i&gt; species being practiced in ancient folkloric medicine, their traditional uses and pharmacological value are poorly documented. Based on the available information on ethnobotany, phytochemistry, pharmacology, and distribution, we aim to provide research gaps and challenges for a better understanding of this genus. This may be resourceful in the development of effective phytomedicines, and aid in conservation. The available studies on this genus on some aspects such as phytochemistry, pharmacological activities, and distribution are under-reported hence the need for further research.">

        <span class="abst" title="Essential oils are being studied for more than 60 years, but a growing interest has emerged in the recent decades due to a desire for a rediscovery of natural remedies. Essential oils are known for millennia and, already in prehistoric times, they were used for medicinal and ritual purposes due to their therapeutic properties. Using a variety of methods refined over the centuries, essential oils are extracted from plant raw materials: the choice of the extraction method is decisive, since it determines the type, quantity, and stereochemical structure of the essential oil molecules. To these components belong all properties that make essential oils so interesting for pharmaceutical uses; the most investigated ones are antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, wound-healing, and anxiolytic activities. However, the main limitations to their use are their hydrophobicity, instability, high volatility, and risk of toxicity. A successful strategy to overcome these limitations is the encapsulation within delivery systems, which enable the increase of essential oils bioavailability and improve their chemical stability, while reducing their volatility and toxicity. Among all the suitable platforms, our review focused on the lipid-based ones, in particular micro- and nanoemulsions, liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, and nanostructured lipid carriers.">

        <span class="abst" title="Medicinal plants with antibacterial effects have been used by humans for centuries. In the recent decade, due to the development of antibiotic resistant strains, many studies have focused on the use of natural compounds as feed additives in livestock. Ginger, among all, have repetitively shown numerous biological activities, antibacterial, and antibiotic properties. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of ginger root powder (GP) on the performance, egg quality, and blood parameters of Japanese quail. A total of 240 10-weeks old female quails were used in a completely randomized design with 4 treatments, 4 replicates, and 15 birds per replicate. Dietary treatment were basal diet (control) and basal diet containing 0.5, 1, and 1.5 g/kg of ginger root powder. Growth performance and exterior and interior quality of egg were measured biweekly over eight-week period. At the end of experiment blood parameters were evaluated. The results showed that diet supplementation with different levels of GP had no significant effect on egg production, egg mass weight, and egg weight (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &gt; 0.05). However, feed intake and feed conversion ratio were significantly lower in the treatment group than the control in the whole period (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05). Egg Quality traits (shape index, albumen index, the percentage of albumen, yolk and shell, yolk pH, and shell thickness and strength) were not affected by the supplements in the whole trial period. Addition of GP significantly increased the albumen height, Haugh unit, and albumen pH in comparison with the control treatment (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05). GP reduced blood triglyceride level yet was ineffective on blood total antioxidant capacity and malondialdehyde. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with GP, could improve productive performance and the egg quality of Japanese quails. Nonetheless a comprehensive study needs to be performed in order to evaluate the impact of quail dietary ginger supplementation on productive performance and egg quality and their stability during storage time for commercial use.">

DSOB also showed considerable antioxidant capacities (scavenging of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid, nitric oxide, peroxynitrite, and hydroxyl radicals). DSOB was a reservoir of polyphenols, and 25 compounds in DSOB were temporarily identified by liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization-quadrupole time of flight-mass spectrometry analysis. Moreover, the carbohydrate, protein, and mineral content of DSOB were increased compared to that of SOB. DSOB contained large amounts of fiber and low levels of sugars, and was rich in calcium and iron. These results imply that DSOB may be a potential functional food ingredient for diabetes, providing excellent economic and environmental benefits.">

As oxidative stress might cause skin impairments, we aim to evaluate a topical preparation containing bilberry leaves extract and bilberry seeds oil, obtained as a byproduct of the food industry. To obtain the extracts, the conventional maceration technique for leaves, and supercritical carbon dioxide extraction for seeds were employed. The chemical profile of both actives was achieved by HPLC and GC methods, revealing the presence of phenolic acids (chlorogenic being the most abundant), flavonoids (isoquercetin in the highest amount), and resveratrol in leaves extract, while in seeds oil the essential ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids were determined in favorable ratio, almost being 1. Antioxidant potential of the wild bilberry extract and seed oil was evaluated using in vitro DPPH and FRAP assays. Finally, effects of the oil-in-water creams with mentioned wild bilberry isolates on the skin were investigated in an in vivo study conducted on healthy human volunteers, revealing the significant beneficial effects when topically applied.">

In Italy, ethnobotanical surveys have received increasing attention in the past two centuries, with some of these studies focusing on wild edible plants. In this regard, the literature in Italy lacks the coverage of some major issues focusing on plants used as herbs and spices. I searched national journals for articles on the use of wild food plants in Italy, published from 1963 to 2020. Aims of the present review were to document plant lore regarding wild herbs and spices in Italy, identify the wild plants most frequently used as spices, analyze the distribution of wild herbs and spices used at a national scale, and finally, to describe the most common phytochemical compounds present in wild plant species. Based on the 34 studies reviewed, I documented 78 wild taxa as being used in Italy as herbs or spices. The studies I included in this systematic review demonstrate that wild species used as herbs and spices enrich Italian folk cuisine and can represent an important resource for profitable, integrated local small-scale activities.">

Although medicine has incontestably evolved in the last years, there is no common ground regarding the early and accurate diagnosis of this condition, its pathogenic mechanisms, and curative treatment. Even though the spontaneous resolution of endometriosis is sometimes possible, recent reports suggested that it can be a progressive condition. It can associate chronic pelvic pain, vaginal bleeding, infertility, or malignant degenerescence. Conventional treatments could produce many side effects, and despite treatment, the symptoms may reappear. In recent years, experimental evidence suggested that plant-based medicine could exert beneficial effects on endometriosis and endometriosis-related symptoms. This study aims to highlight the pharmaceutical activity of phytochemicals and medicinal plants against endometriosis and to provide a source of information regarding the alternative treatment of this condition.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;For this review, we performed a research using PubMed, GoogleScholar, and CrossRef databases. We selected the articles published between January 2000 and July 2020, written in English.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;We found 17 medicinal plants and 13 phytochemicals, which have demonstrated their beneficial effects against endometriosis. Several of their biological activities consist of antiangiogenic, anti-inflammatory effects, and oxidative-stress reduction.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Medicinal herbs and their bioactive compounds exhibit antiangiogenic, antioxidant, sedative and pain-alleviating properties and the effects recorded until now encourage their use for the conservative management of endometriosis.">

        <span class="abst" title="Suaeda monoica Forssk. ex J.F.Gmel. (Amaranthaceae), a mangrove associate and ethno-medicinal herb of Indian Sundarbans, was investigated as a promising source of bioactive compounds. Various polar and nonpolar solvent extracts of the leaf and root-shoot parts of the plant exhibited antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, allelopathic, mosquitocidal, antihaemolytic and antidiuretic potential. Moreover, to meet pharmacological requirements, the antioxidant ability of the plant was validated by both chemical and biological analyses. Extraction yield and presence of different phytochemicals like phenolics, flavonoids, tannins and saponins were compared in various solvent-extracted fractions. Principle component analysis revealed that the antioxidant property present in different extracts maintained a positive correlation with the occurrence of polyphenols (phenolics, tannins and flavonoids). Biochemical evaluation, HPLC examination and GC-MS analysis showed a differential level of the presence of various phytochemicals in different solvent extracts. In contrast to mosquitocidal, antioxidant, antihaemolytic and phytotoxic properties which were observed to be dominant in polar solvent extracts, maximum antibacterial potency was detected in nonpolar &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-hexane fractions. Overall, the plant extract is nontoxic in nature and a dose amounting to 3,000 mg/kg was well tolerated by Swiss albino mice. A combination of HPLC and GC-MS analyses showed the presence of a large number of structurally diverse phytochemicals, many of which had already been reported as insecticidal, mosquitocidal, antibacterial, herbicidal, antidiuretic, antioxidant and anti-haemolytic compounds. All these findings support that the least explored traditional edible medicinal mangrove associate S.monoica is enriched with multiple bioactive molecules and may be considered as one of the richest sources of various lead molecules of pharmaceutical importance.">

As a great threat to global public health, the development of treatment options has become vital, and a rush to find a cure has mobilized researchers globally from all areas.&lt;h4&gt;Scope and approach&lt;/h4&gt;This review focuses on deciphering the potential of different secondary metabolites from medicinal plants as therapeutic options either as inhibitors of therapeutic targets of SARS-CoV-2 or as blockers of viral particles entry through host cell receptors. The use of medicinal plants containing specific phytomoieties could be seen in providing a safer and long-term solution for the population with lesser side effects. Key Findings and Conclusions: Considering the high cost and time-consuming drug discovery process, therapeutic repositioning of existing drugs was explored as treatment option in COVID-19, however several molecules have been retracted as therapeutics either due to no positive outcomes or the severe side effects. These effects call for exploring the alternate treatment options which are therapeutically effective as well as safe. Keeping this in mind, phytopharmaceuticals derived from medicinal plants could be explored as important resources in the development of COVID-19 treatment, as their role in the past for treatment of viral diseases like HIV, MERS-CoV, and influenza has been well reported. Considering this fact, different phytoconstituents such as flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins and glycosides etc. Possessing antiviral properties against coronaviruses and possessing potential against SARS-CoV-2 have been reviewed in the present work.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Streptococcus agalactiae (S. agalactiae) is a contagious pathogen of bovine mastitis. It has financial implications for the dairy cattle industry in certain areas of the world. Since antimicrobial resistance increases in dairy farms, natural antimicrobials from herbal origins and nanoparticles have been given more attention as an alternative therapy. Hence, this study reported the antimicrobial and antibiofilm potentials of cinnamon oil, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), and their combination against multidrug-resistant (MDR) S. agalactiae recovered from clinical bovine mastitis in Egypt.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Our findings revealed that 73% (146/200) of the examined milk samples collected from dairy cows with clinical mastitis were infected with Streptococci species. Of these, 9.59% (14/146) were identified as S. agalactiae and categorized as MDR. S. agalactiae isolates expressed four virulence genes (Hyl, cylE, scpB, and lmb) and demonstrated an ability to produce biofilms. Cinnamon oil showed high antimicrobial (MICs ≤0.063 μg /mL) and antibiofilm (MBIC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 4 μg/mL) potentials against planktonic and biofilms of S. agalactiae isolates, respectively. However, AgNPs showed reasonable antimicrobial (MICs ≤16 μg/mL) and relatively low antibiofilm (MBIC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 64 μg/mL) activities against screened isolates. Synergistic antimicrobial or additive antibiofilm interactions of cinnamon oil combined with AgNPs were reported for the first time. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis revealed that biofilms of S. agalactiae isolates treated with cinnamon oil were more seriously damaged than observed in AgNPs cinnamon oil combination. Moreover, reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) showed that cinnamon oil exerted a remarkable down-regulation of pili biosynthesis genes (pilA and pilB) and their regulator (rogB) against S. agalactiae biofilms, meanwhile the AgNPs cinnamon oil combination demonstrated a lower efficacy.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;This is an in vitro preliminary approach that documented the antibiofilm potential of cinnamon oil and the inhibitory activity of cinnamon oil and its combination with AgNPs against MDR S. agalactiae recovered from clinical mastitis. Further in vivo studies should be carried out in animal models to provide evidence of concept for implementing these alternative candidates in the treatment of dairy farms infected by streptococcal mastitis in the future.">

At present, the whole world is trying to combat this coronavirus disease and scientific communities are putting rigorous efforts to develop vaccines. However, there are only a few specific medical treatments for SARS-CoV-2. Apart from other public health measures taken to prevent this virus, we can boost our immunity with natural products. In this article, we have highlighted the potential of common spices and herbs as antiviral agents and immunity boosters. A questionnaire-based online survey has been conducted on home remedies during COVID-19 among a wide range of peoples (n-531) of different age groups (13-68 years) from various countries. According to the survey, 71.8% of people are taking kadha for combating infection and boosting immunity. Most people (86.1%) think that there is no side effect of kadha while 13.9% think vice versa. A total of 93.6% of people think that spices are helpful in curing coronavirus or other viral infection as well as boosting immunity. Most people are using tulsi drops, vitamin C, and chyawanprash for boosting their immunity. Therefore, we conclude from the survey and available literature that spices and herbs play a significant role against viral infections.">

The morphology, colony number, and aflatoxin content of &lt;i&gt;A. flavus&lt;/i&gt; in platycladi semen were investigated by stereomicroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, plate counting, and high-performance liquid chromatography. The results indicated that the MIC of EO was 0.8 μL⋅mL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, and the main components were β-phellandrene (7.53%), D-limonene (13.24%), linalool (41.73%), terpinen-4-ol (5.33%), and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-nerolidol (6.30%). After the EO fumigated the platycladi semen, the growth of &lt;i&gt;A. flavus&lt;/i&gt; slowed, and the mycelium shrank considerably. The number of colonies after EO treatment at room temperature and cold storage was significantly reduced, the inhibition effect was better under cold storage, and the aflatoxin B1 content did not exceed the standard within 100 days.

Due to the dispersion of the light amount of essence through the AWs, they have their specific pleasant smell, taste, and medicinal properties. In Iranian traditional medicine, &lt;i&gt;Trachyspermum ammi&lt;/i&gt; AW is used to treat gastrointestinal disorders. The present study was conducted to determine the chemical composition of the essential oil extracted from &lt;i&gt;T. ammi&lt;/i&gt; AW and its antifungal activities against &lt;i&gt;Candida&lt;/i&gt; species.&lt;h4&gt;Materials and methods&lt;/h4&gt;The composition of the essential oil extracted from &lt;i&gt;T. ammi&lt;/i&gt; AW was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.

Moreover, the biofilm formation inhibition, antioxidant properties, and experimental activity of AW were determined in an animal model.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;According to the results, thymol (78.08%) was the major compound of EO, followed by carvacrol (8.20%) and carvotanacetone (6.50%). Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;T. ammi&lt;/i&gt; AW exhibited antifungal activities against the examined fungi and inhibited the biofilm formation of C. albicans at a concentration of up to 0.25 V/V.

Pleasant odor and antioxidant properties are extra bonuses to the antimicrobial effects of this plant. Based on the findings, AW might have the potential to be used in the management of alimentary candidiasis or oral hygienic products.">

Consequently, it is necessary to find ways of reducing methane emissions in ruminants. Studies have reported that feed additives such as nitrogen-containing compounds, probiotics, prebiotics, and plant extracts significantly reduce ruminant methane; however, systematic reviews of such studies are lacking. The present article summarizes research over the past five years on the effects of nitrogen-containing compounds, probiotics, probiotics, and plant extracts on methane emissions in ruminants. The paper could provide theoretical support and guide future research in animal production and global warming mitigation.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;This review uses the Web of Science database to search keywords related to ruminants and methane reduction in the past five years, and uses Sci-Hub, PubMed, etc. as auxiliary searchers.

In this circumstance, essential oils of medicinal plants origin are supreme sources of structural and functionally divergent compounds, which inhibited the growth of common wound colonizing MRSA and ESBL producing &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa.&lt;/i&gt; The aim of this study was to evaluate the combined antibacterial activity of essential oils extracted from &lt;i&gt;Rumex abyssinicus, Cucumis pustulatus,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Discopodium penninervium&lt;/i&gt; against multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates of skin ulcers.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Essential oils (EOs) were extracted from aerial parts of &lt;i&gt;R. abyssinicus, C. pustulatus&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;D. penninervium&lt;/i&gt; with steam distillation. A mixture of each oil (1 : 1) was adsorbed to a disc and placed on Mueller Hinton Agar. Then, minimum zone of inhibition and bactericidal concentration of EOs was measured after incubeted for 18-24 hours at 37 °C. Their combined antibacterial effect was determined by the fractional inhibitory concentration index.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The antibacterial activity of mixed oil varied in their doses and bacteria species, of which a mixture of essential oil of &lt;i&gt;R. abyssinicus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;D. penninervium&lt;/i&gt; had inhibition zone (32 mm); its MIC and MBC values range from 1-2 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;l/ml against MRSA.

Conclusion&lt;/i&gt;. This in vitro study of the combined effect of EOs has significant antibacterial activity on wound colonizing bacteria and reduces delaying wound healing as that of modern drugs tested in parallel. Hence, further structural elucidation of active compounds helps us to properly design or synthesis of topical antibiotics for wound care.">

Female Swiss albino mice were divided into five groups depending on the combination of skin cancer-inducing 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) and extract of &lt;i&gt;Inula viscosa&lt;/i&gt; treatments. Histology of the affected skin and measurement of proteasome activity were performed to demonstrate the effect of &lt;i&gt;Inula viscosa&lt;/i&gt; on mice. The identification of the molecules responsible for this inhibitory activity was carried out through the docking studies. The results showed that &lt;i&gt;Inula viscosa&lt;/i&gt; extracts inhibit the development of papilloma in mice. Therefore, the best chemopreventive action of &lt;i&gt;Inula viscosa&lt;/i&gt; was observed on mice in which extract treatment was performed before and after the induction of skin carcinogenesis. It was revealed that the ingestion of extracts &lt;i&gt;Inula viscosa&lt;/i&gt; delays the formation of skin papillomas in animals and simultaneously decreases the size and number of papillomas, which is also reflected on the skin histology of the mice treated. Structure-activity relationship information obtained from component of &lt;i&gt;Inula viscosa&lt;/i&gt; particularly tomentosin, inuviscolide, and isocosticacid demonstrated that distinct bonding modes in &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; &lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; &lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; subunits determine its selectivity and potent inhibition for &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; &lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; subunit.">

Although there is the continued development of new drugs from synthetic sources as antiviral agents, medicinal plants continue to provide the basic raw materials for some of the most important antiviral drugs. Alkaloids are a class of pharmacologically active plant compounds that are usually alkaline in nature. In this review, we tried to summarize recent progress in herb-based antiviral research, the advantages of using active plant compounds as antiviral agents, and the inflammatory responses initiated by alkaloids, based on the literature from 2009 to 2019, for the treatment of conditions, including influenza, human immunodeficiency virus, herpes simplex virus, hepatitis, and coxsackievirus infections. Articles are retrieved from PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science using relevant keywords. In particular, the alkaloids from medicinal plants responsible for the molecular mechanisms of anti-inflammatory actions are identified and discussed. This review can provide a theoretical basis and approaches for using various alkaloids as antiviral treatments. More research is needed to develop alkaloidal compounds as antiviral therapeutic agents and potential regulators of the anti-inflammatory response.">

In this study, the therapeutic effect of flaxseed oil on the ovariectomized adult rats was investigated. Our results showed that biochemical parameters including calcium, oestrogen and progesterone levels increase 8 weeks after ovariectomy in rats. Also, the amount of alkaline phosphatase decreased significantly after 8 weeks compared with the OVX rat. The healing potential of flaxseed oil was proven by successfully recovering the affected tissue and preventing the unpleasant symptoms of ovariectomized rats. The biological effects of flaxseed oil may be due to high amounts of fatty acids, phytoestrogens and an array of antioxidants. The results suggest that flaxseed oil can mimic the action of oestrogen and can be a potential treatment for hormone replacement therapy (HRT).">

The healthcare systems of many countries are overwhelmed due to limited therapeutic options and the absence of an approved vaccine. Due to its poor healthcare systems, Africa may be the worst hit continent if other therapeutic alternatives are not explored.

Easily available plants formulations safe to human health and environment are presented with easy procedure for their preparations. Data have been collected from literature for dissemination to scientific community and common society. A recent report published on human health hazards linked with the frequent use of alcohol based hand sanitizers provoked the scientific community to prepare safe hand rubs. National Poison Data System, USA revealed 36.7% increase in alcoholic hand sanitizer exposure and toxicity in first three months of 2020 as compared to 2019. Adaptation of alternative preparations of hand sanitizers based on natural and plant resources are the possible solution to get ride off toxicity problem.

Nowadays, there is a turn towards the investigation of natural products (i.e., essential oils, organic acids, and edible coatings) in an effort to lower the usage of chemical synthetic compounds (i.e., chlorine) as postharvest sanitizers. The aim of the present study was to assess the effectiveness of &lt;i&gt;Origanum majorana&lt;/i&gt; essential oil (EO), ascorbic acid (AA), chitosan, and their combinations on quality attributes of fresh-cut lettuce stored for six days at 7 °C. When applied, Chitosan+AA resulted to a less acceptable product (visual quality and aroma), while the application of marjoram EO was able to preserve the visual quality of fresh-cut lettuce and at the same time resulted in a pleasant aroma. The application of EO+AA and Chitosan+AA increased total phenolics and antioxidant levels of fresh-cut lettuce on the fourth and sixth day of storage. The EO and EO+AA increased damage index (hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxidation) of fresh-cut lettuce, while at the same time these treatments decreased the activity of enzymes related with plant tissue browning (i.e., peroxidase activity and polyphenol oxidase). Chitosan decreased total valuable counts and yeasts and molds counts on the sixth day of storage, while EO, AA, EO+Chitosan, and Chitosan+AA decreased yeasts and molds after four days of application. The findings of the present work indicating that the combination of marjoram EO, AA, and chitosan could be considered further as alternative means for fresh-cut produce preservation.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Eleutherococcus senticosus&lt;/i&gt; (Rupr. et Maxim.) Maxim. is a medicinal plant used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for thousands of years. However, due to the overexploitation, this species is considered to be endangered and is included in the Red List, e.g., in the Republic of Korea. Therefore, a new source of this important plant in Europe is needed. The aim of this study was to develop pharmacognostic and phytochemical parameters of the fruits. The content of polyphenols (eleutherosides B, E, E1) and phenolic acids in the different parts of the fruits, as well as tocopherols, fatty acids in the oil, and volatile constituents were studied by the means of chromatographic techniques [HPLC with Photodiode-Array Detection (PDA), headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME/GC-MS)]. To the best of our knowledge, no information is available on the content of eleutherosides and phenolic acids in the pericarp and seeds. The highest sum of eleutheroside B and E was detected in the whole fruits (1.4 mg/g), next in the pericarp (1.23 mg/g) and the seeds (0.85 mg/g). Amongst chlorogenic acid derivatives (3-CQA, 4-CQA, 5-CQA), 3-CQA was predominant in the whole fruits (1.08 mg/g), next in the pericarp (0.66 mg/g), and the seeds (0.076 mg/g). The oil was rich in linoleic acid (C18:3 (n-3), 18.24%), ursolic acid (35.72 mg/g), and α-tocopherol (8.36 mg/g). The presence of druses and yellow oil droplets in the inner zone of the mesocarp and chromoplasts in the outer zone can be used as anatomical markers. These studies provide a phytochemical proof for accumulation of polyphenols mainly in the pericarp, and these structures may be taken into consideration as their source subjected to extraction to obtain polyphenol-rich extracts.">

Structural analysis comprehended elemental analysis and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H/&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C/&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F NMR spectra. The analysis of structure-activity relationships within this molecular library of 38 structurally-related compounds reported that some chemical modifications of the OH group of thymol led to broad-spectrum growth inhibition on all isolates. Preferred substitutions were benzyl groups compared to alkyl chains, and the specific presence of functional groups at &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt; position of the benzyl moiety such as 4-CN and 4-Ph endowed the most anti-&lt;i&gt;H. pylori&lt;/i&gt; activity toward all the strains with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values up to 4 µg/mL. Poly-substitution on the benzyl ring was not essential. Moreover, several compounds characterized by the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration/minimum bactericidal concentration (MIC/MBC) values against &lt;i&gt;H. pylori&lt;/i&gt; were also tested in order to verify a cytotoxic effect against AGS cells with respect to 5-fluorouracil and carvacrol. Three derivatives can be considered as new lead compounds alternative to current therapy to manage &lt;i&gt;H. pylori&lt;/i&gt; infection, preventing the occurrence of severe gastric diseases. The present work confirms the possibility to use natural compounds as templates for the medicinal semi-synthesis.">

However, there are no reports on the effects of andrographolide on the human suprapatellar fat pad of osteoarthritis patients. In the present study, our goal was to evaluate the innovative effects of andrographolide on viability and Tri-lineage differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells from suprapatellar fat pad tissues. The results revealed that andrographolide had no cytotoxic effects when the concentration was less than 12.5 µM. Interestingly, andrographolide had significantly enhanced, dose dependent, osteogenesis and chondrogenesis as evidenced by a significantly intensified stain for Alizarin Red S, Toluidine Blue and Alcian Blue. Moreover, andrographolide can upregulate the expression of genes related to osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation, including &lt;i&gt;Runx2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;OPN&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Sox9&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Aggrecan&lt;/i&gt; in mesenchymal stem cells from human suprapatellar fat pad tissues. In contrast, andrographolide suppressed adipogenic differentiation as evidenced by significantly diminished Oil Red O staining and expression levels for adipogenic-specific genes for &lt;i&gt;PPAR-γ2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;LPL&lt;/i&gt;. These findings confirm that andrographolide can specifically enhance osteogenesis and chondrogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells from human suprapatellar fat pad tissues. It has potential as a therapeutic agent derived from natural sources for regenerative medicine.">

It has been found that plant-derived mucilage can be used as a natural thickener or emulsifier and an alternative to synthetic polymers and additives. Because it is an invisible barrier that separates the surface from the surrounding atmosphere, it is used as edible coatings to extend the shelf life of fresh vegetables and fruits as well as many food products. In addition to its functional properties, mucilage can also be used for the production of nanocarriers. In this review, we focus on mucus extraction methods and its use as a natural preservative for fresh produce. We detailed the key properties related to the extraction and preservation of food, the mechanism of the effect of mucus on the sensory properties of products, coating methods when using mucus and its recipe for preserving fruit and vegetables. Understanding the ecological, economic and scientific factors of production and the efficiency of mucus as a multi-directional agent will open up its practical application in many industries.">

High-performance liquid chromatography was performed to determine the main phenols. Rosmarinic acid was identified as the predominant phenolic compound in this species (76.01 mg/100 g DW), followed by protocatechuic acid, which to our knowledge, no previous study reported similar concentrations in &lt;i&gt;O. vulgare&lt;/i&gt;.

In this scenario, we report herein, as far as we know, for the first time the use of the zein protein as a gating moiety and its application for the controlled release of essential oil components (EOCs). The design of microdevices consist of mesoporous silica particles loaded with essential oils components (thymol, carvacrol and cinnamaldehyde) and functionalized with the zein (prolamin) protein found in corn as a molecular gate. The zein protein grafted on the synthesized microdevices is degraded by the proteolytic action of bacterial enzymatic secretions with the consequent release of the loaded essential oil components efficiently inhibiting bacterial growth. The results allow us to conclude that the new microdevice presented here loaded with the essential oil component cinnamaldehyde improved the antimicrobial properties of the free compound by decreasing volatility and increasing local concentration.">

To determine β-caryophyllene accumulation, we have isolated the essential oil from FDP-treated calli and HRs and quantified β-caryophyllene using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The highest production of β-caryophyllene was noticed in HR cultures induced using A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;1000&lt;/sub&gt; strains on half-strength MS medium containing 3 μM FDP, which produced 2.92 and 2.80 mg/ml β-caryophyllene, respectively. The optimized protocol can be used commercially by scaling up the production of a β-caryophyllene compound in a short span of time.">

Based on the current reality of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, this study aimed to make a review literature about potential anti-coronavirus natural compounds guided by an in silico study. In the first step, essential oils from native species found in the Brazilian herbal medicine market and Brazilian species that have already shown antiviral potential were used as source for the literature search and compounds selection. Among these compounds, 184 showed high antiviral potential against rhinovirus or picornavirus by quantitative structure-activity relationship analysis. (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-α-atlantone; 14-hydroxy-α-muurolene; allo-aromadendrene epoxide; amorpha-4,9-dien-2-ol; aristochene; azulenol; germacrene A; guaia-6,9-diene; hedycaryol; humulene epoxide II; α-amorphene; α-cadinene; α-calacorene and α-muurolene showed by a molecular docking study the best result for four target proteins that are essential for SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle. In addition, other parameters obtained for the selected compounds indicated low toxicity and showed good probability to achieve cell permeability and be used as a drug. These results guided the second literature search which included other species in addition to native Brazilian plants. The majority presence of any of these compounds was reported for essential oils from 45 species. In view of the few studies relating essential oils and antiviral activity, this review is important for future assays against the new coronavirus.&lt;h4&gt;Supplementary information&lt;/h4&gt;The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11101-021-09754-4.">

The widespread and imprudent use of antibacterial agents in poultry flocks have increased resistant to many antibacterial agents which has become a major public health concern. Some medicinal plants may be alternative to antibacterial agents. The purpose of this study was to investigate the antibacterial and anti-biofilm activity of summer savory essential oil against &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; isolated from poultry.&lt;h4&gt;Materials and methods&lt;/h4&gt;The essential oil was extracted using a Clevenger apparatus and subsequently its compounds were determined using GC-MS. Antibacterial properties of essential oil were determined by disc diffusion method, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). To evaluate the anti-biofilm properties the Microtiter plate test was used. Herbal essential oil was extracted and its compounds were identified correctly.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The major components of &lt;i&gt;Satureja hortensis&lt;/i&gt; essential oil were thymol (41.28%), γ-terpinene (37.63%), p-cymene (12.2%) and α-terpinene (3.52%). The inhibition zone diameter in the disc diffusion test for &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; were 32 ± 3 and 38 ± 4 mm, respectively, which was confirmed by MIC and MBC values. Regarding anti-biofilm activity, the MIC/2 concentration of &lt;i&gt;S. hortensis&lt;/i&gt; significantly inhibited biofilm formation of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;. However, inhibition of biofilm formation of &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; was shown at concentration of MIC/2 and MIC/4.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Based on our results, &lt;i&gt;S. hortensis&lt;/i&gt; essential oil showed the growth inhibition and bactericidal activity against &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt;.

Rosa damascena Mill. is one of the most important aromatic species of the Rosaceae family from which essential oil and economically valuable products can be obtained. The present study was designed to investigate the major compositions of the essential oil of this plant in Isfahan region of Iran and to identify its antibacterial and antifungal effects against 11 microorganisms causing human diseases and food spoilage. The essential oil was extracted by using the Clevenger apparatus and was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technique. Its antimicrobial activity was evaluated by well diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericide concentration (MBC). The results showed that the most important compounds of the essential oil were nonadecane (24.72%), heneicosane (19.325%), oleic acid (17.63%), and citronellol (12.61%). The results also showed that the highest inhibition zone of rose essential oil was against Aspergillus brasiliensis (15.00 ± 0.00 mm) and had a significant effect on Klebsiella pneumoniae (~ 8.00 mm). Also the rose oil had a significant inhibition and lethal effect against Candida albicans (MIC and MBC ~ 125 μg/mL), which is equivalent to the nystatin antibiotic (~ 125 μg/mL). Therefore, the essential oil of Damask rose can be considered as an alternative natural product for the prevention and treatment of fungal diseases in humans and against food spoilage as well.">

In this study, a novel growing media with various perlite particle size and its mixture with peat moss was tested for hydroponic-based production of Echinacea purpurea medicinal plant under greenhouse conditions. The plant growth parameters such as plant height, total fresh leave weight, fresh root weight, total biomass, total chlorophyll, leaf area, and essential oil compositions were assessed. Perlite particle size in the growing media was varied from very coarse (more than 2 mm) to very fine (less than 0.5 mm), and the ratio between perlite and peat moss varied from 50:50 v/v to 30:70 v/v. In addition, two nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) to ammonium (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) ratios (90:10 and 70:30) were tested for each growing media. The medium containing very fine-grade perlite and 50:50 v/v perlite to peat moss ratio was found to be most optimal and beneficial for E. purpurea performance, resulting in maximal plant height, fresh and dry weight, leaf surface area, and chlorophyll content. It was also found that an increase in NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;/NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ratio caused a significant increase in plant growth parameters and increase the plant essential oil content. The major terpene hydrocarbons found in extract of E. purpurea with the best growth parameters were germacrene D (51%), myrcene (15%), α-pinene (12%), β-caryophyllene (11%), and 1-Pentadecene (4.4%), respectively. The percentages of these terpene hydrocarbons were increased by increasing of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;/NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ratio.

Inside the infected tissue, the causative agents are found in grains. The most common causative agents form black grains and are sterile upon isolation. In vitro susceptibility assays were developed for eumycetoma causative agents. They were based on the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute M38A protocol and modified to enable the use of hyphae as a starting inoculum. To ease endpoint reading, viability dyes such as resazurin or XTT have been used. So far the in vitro susceptibility assays developed have mainly been used to establish if causative agents are inhibited in growth by various antifungal agents, but not for clinical decision making. For drug discovery, the assay proved useful in determining which compounds were able to prevent hyphal growth. However, a clear correlation between in vitro inhibition in terms of the half maximal inhibitory concentration or 50% minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC50) and therapeutic efficacy assayed in a novel model system in terms of Galleria mellonella larval survival was not found. For clinical decision making, a range of MICs were found for each antifungal agent. However, no clinical breakpoints have been established for any of the causative agents. For itraconazole, the MIC50 of most causative agents was below the attainable serum levels, which might indicate that they are susceptible. However, before in vitro susceptibility can be used in clinical decision making for mycetoma, a correlation between MIC and clinical outcome needs to be made.">

Many research investigations documented the usefulness of US in a wide range of applications in food science, nanotechnology, and complementary medicine, where effective extraction of natural products is important. However, as with all novel technologies, US has advantages and limitations that require clarification for full adaptation at an industrial scale. The present review discusses recent applications of US in herbal phytochemistry with the emphasis on US effects on chemical structures of bioactive compounds extracted from herbs and their bioactivities. The impact of different US processing conditions such as frequency, intensity, duration, temperature, and pressure on the effectiveness of the extraction process and the properties of the extracted materials are also discussed. Different frequencies and intensities of US have demonstrated its potential applications in modifying, determining, and predicting the physicochemical properties of herbs and their extracts. US has important applications in nanotechnology where it supports the fabrication of inexpensive and eco-friendly herbal nanostructures, as well as acoustic-based biosensors for chemical imaging of the herbal tissues. The application of US enhances the rates of chemical processes such as hydrolysis of herbal fibers, which reduces the time and energy consumed without affecting the quality of the final products. Overall, the use of US in herbal science has great potential to create novel chemical constructions and to be used as an innovative diagnostic system in various biomedical, food, and analytical applications.">

        <span class="abst" title="Damask rose (Rosa damascena Mill.) is an aromatic medicinal plant rich in bioactive compounds with high value in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. Knowledge of the factors affecting the quantitative and qualitative properties of the compounds in its essential oil (EO) and the bioactivity of this EO is important in optimizing Damask rose cultivation and production. This research studied, for the first time, the effects of irrigation water and soil chemical and physical characteristics on the EO yield of this important commercial species and on it chemical composition and antimicrobial activity. The results showed the significant effect of crop cultivation site on yield, chemical composition and inhibition zone diameter (IZD) at the 1% significance level. The highest EO yield (~0.0266%), which belonged to the Noushabad site (EON), resulted from the increased soil electrical conductivity (EC) and the higher sand, gypsum and lime contents and irrigation water salinity. Analysis of the chemical composition of the EOs showed that their main compounds at all three crop sites were citronellol, nonadecane, heneicosane and geraniol. The EO obtained from the Yazdel site (EOY) had the highest contents of citronellol and geraniol (~29.05% and ~6.85%) that were directly correlated with soil potassium and phosphorus contents and inversely correlated with soil acidity and EC and its lime, nitrogen, and organic carbon contents. Antimicrobial assays indicated that the EO extracted from the Sefidshahr site (EOS), which had the largest inhibition zone diameter (~14.67 mm) for Aspergillus brasiliensis (IZD~14.67 mm) and the lowest MIC (~31.25 μg/mL) for Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, exhibited efficacy similar to that of rifampin, probably due to the dominance of the alkanes in it. The EOY and EOS also exhibited the strongest inhibitory and lethal activity against Candida albicans (MIC and MBC &lt;15.63 μg/mL for EOY and MIC and MBC = 62.5 μg/mL for EOS), which were six and four times stronger than those of nystatin, respectively. Therefore, the selected EOs can act as a potentially promising strategy for fighting microbial strains.">

        <span class="abst" title="Dementia is a term that encompasses a group of clinical symptoms affecting memory, thinking and social abilities, characterized by progressive impairment of memory performance and cognitive functions. There are several factors involved in the pathogenesis and progression of dementia, such as old age, brain ischemia, toxin exposure, and oxidative stress. There are extensive similarities between dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) either in clinical manifestations or experimental animal models. AD is the most dominant form of dementia, characterized by the accumulation of beta-amyloid protein and cholinergic neurotransmission deficits in the brain. Currently available medications for the treatment of dementia, such as choline esterase inhibitors, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists (memantine), have short-term efficacy and only relieve symptoms rather than targeting the main underlying pathogenesis. Several animal studies and clinical trials are being conducted to provide a rational approach to these medicinal plants in the prevention or treatment of memory deficits. This review highlights the potential effects of medicinal plants and their derived lead molecules, and explains the related mechanisms and effects reviewed from published literature as major thrust aspects and hopeful strategies in the prevention or treatment of dementia.">

        <span class="abst" title="The genus Thymus is traditionally used for the treatment of hyperactive airways complaints. The purpose of the current study is to investigate the potential tracheal relaxant effect and possible mechanism(s) of the essential oil of &lt;i&gt;Thymus serrulatus&lt;/i&gt; (TS Oil) in isolated guinea pig tracheal tissues. The essential oil was obtained from the fresh erial parts of &lt;i&gt;Thymus serrulatus&lt;/i&gt;, and its phyto-components were identified by GC-MS analysis. Guinea pig tracheal preparations were used for testing the tracheal relaxant effect of TS Oil with the determination of the mechanism(s) involved in this relaxation. GC-MS findings reveal that terpenes, fragrance constituents, saponins, and higher fatty acids are present in TS Oil. In isolated guinea pig trachea, TS Oil inhibited carbachol (CCh, 1 µM) and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (80 mM)-induced contractions in a pattern similar to that of dicyclomine. TS Oil, at 0.3 mg/ml, shifted parallel CCh-curves towards the right, followed by a non-parallel shift at higher concentration (1 mg/ml), thus suppressing maximum response in the same manner as produced by dicyclomine. Pretreatment of tissues with TS Oil (1 and 3 mg/ml) also produced a rightward shift of Ca&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; concentration-response curves (CRCs) in the same manner as caused by verapamil. Further, TS Oil at low concentrations (0.3 and 1 mg/ml) shifted isoprenaline-induced inhibitory CRCs towards the left and increased cAMP levels in isolated tracheal homogenates similar to papaverine, a phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor. In the antimicrobial assay performed by the agar well diffusion method, TS Oil was found most active against &lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; where the zone of inhibition measured was 28 mm. Additionally, there was little difference between standard strains of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. However, methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MRSA) showed a small zone of inhibition as compared to standard strains (22 mm). From these results, it can be concluded that the essential oil of &lt;i&gt;T. serrulatus&lt;/i&gt; has the potential to produce antimicrobial effects while causing tracheal relaxation mediated possibly by anticholinergic effects, Ca&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; channel blockade, and PDE inhibition whereas additional mechanism(s) cannot be ruled out.">

The &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; antidiarrheal activity of the stem extracts were evaluated by using castor oil-induced diarrhea, castor oil-induced enteropooling and charcoal induced intestinal transit in mice model. Besides, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; antimicrobial potentiality of MECD was investigated by the disc diffusion method. &lt;i&gt;In silico&lt;/i&gt; activity of the isolated compounds were performed by Schrödinger-Maestro (Version 11.1) software. In addition, The ADME/T analysis and PASS prediction were implemented by using pass online tools. In the antidiarrheal investigation, the MECD exhibited a notable inhibition rate in all test approaches which were statistically significant (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.1, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.01).

        <span class="abst" title="Lipid-based drug delivery systems are widely used for enhancing the bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs. However, following oral intake, lipid excipients often undergo gastrointestinal lipolysis, which drastically affects drugs solubility and bioavailability. That's why developing new lipid excipients which are resistant to digestion would be of great interest. We studied here the potential role of the unconventional Chinese star anise whole seedpod oil (CSAO) as an alternative multifunctional lipid excipient. Pancreatic lipase-mediated digestion of the extracted crude oil emulsion was assessed &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Pancreatic lipase, being a strict &lt;i&gt;sn&lt;/i&gt;-1,3-regioselective lipase, showed a high (16-fold) olive oil to CSAO activity ratio, which could be attributed to fatty acids composition and triglycerides intramolecular structure. For the sake of comparison, the non-regioselective lipase Novozyme® 435 exhibited higher activity than pancreatic lipase on CSAO emulsion, perhaps due to its ability to release fatty acids from the internal &lt;i&gt;sn&lt;/i&gt;-2 position of TAGs. Apart counteracting lipolysis, CSAO oil also showed additional biopharmaceutical benefits including moderate antioxidant and antihypertensive activities. Altogether, these findings highlight for the first time the potential use of star anise unconventional whole seedpod oil as a multifunctional lipid excipient for the development of new lipid formulations.">

Thus, in our current study, we intended to explore the potential ability of Himalayan medicinal plant (HMP) bioactives against COVID-19 using computational investigations.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Molecular docking was performed against six crucial targets involved in the replication and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. About forty-two HMP bioactives were analyzed against these targets for their binding energy, molecular interactions, inhibition constant, and biological pathway enrichment analysis. Pharmacological properties and potential biological functions of HMP bioactives were predicted using the ADMETlab and PASS webserver respectively.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Our current investigation has demonstrated that the bioactives of HMPs potentially act against COVID-19. Docking results showed that several HMP bioactives had a superior binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 essential targets like 3CL&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt;, PLpro, RdRp, helicase, spike protein, and human ACE2. Based on the binding energies, several bioactives were selected and analyzed for pathway enrichment studies. We have found that selected HMP bioactives may have a role in regulating immune and apoptotic pathways. Furthermore, these selected HMP bioactives have shown lower toxicity with pleiotropic biological activities, including anti-viral activities in predicting activity spectra for substances.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Current study results can explore the possibility of HMPs as therapeutic agents against COVID-19.">

        <span class="abst" title="Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a fatal systemic disease of felids caused by a Coronavirus (CoV) (FIPV). In spite of its clinical relevance and impact on feline health, currently the therapeutic possibilities for treatment of FIP in cats are limited. The emergence of the pandemic Severe Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), etiological agent of the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), able to infect a broad spectrum of animal species including cats, triggered the interest for the development of novel molecules with antiviral activity for treatment of CoV infections in humans and animals. Essential oils (EOs) have raised significant attention for their antiviral properties integrating and, in some cases, replacing conventional drugs. Thymus vulgaris EO (TEO) has been previously shown to be effective against several RNA viruses including CoVs. In the present study the antiviral efficacy of TEO against FIPV was evaluated in vitro. TEO at 27 μg/ml was able to inhibit virus replication with a significant reduction of 2 log10 TCID&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;/50 μl. Moreover, virucidal activity was tested using TEO at 27 and 270 μg/ml, over the cytotoxic threshold, determining a reduction of viral titre as high as 3.25 log10 TCID&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;/50 μl up to 1 h of time contact. These results open several perspectives in terms of future applications and therapeutic possibilities for coronaviruses considering that FIPV infection in cats could be a potential model for the study of antivirals against CoVs.">

        <span class="abst" title="One of the most frequent forms of dementia in neurological disorders is Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is a chronic neurodegenerative disease characterized by impaired learning and memory. Pathological symptoms as extracellular amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and intracellular accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles occur in AD. Due to the aging of the population and increased prevalence of AD, discovery of new therapeutic agents with the highest effectiveness and fewer side effect seems to be necessary. Numerous synthetic medicines such as tacrine, donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, memantine, glutathione, ascorbic acid, ubiquinone, ibuprofen, and ladostigil are routinely used for reduction of the symptoms and prevention of disease progression. Nowadays, herbal medicines have attracted popular attention for numerous beneficial effects with little side effects. &lt;i&gt;Lavandula angustifolia, Ginkgo biloba, Melissa officinalis, Crocus sativus, Ginseng, Salvia miltiorrhiza&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Magnolia officinalis&lt;/i&gt; have been widely used for relief of symptoms of some neurological disorders. This paper reviews the therapeutic effects of phytomedicines with prominent effects against various factors implicated in the emergence and progression of AD.">

The combination of OEO and SNE reduced 29% of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), while BHT reduced 31% of TBARS generated during refrigeration storage in salmon burgers in relation to the control sample without antioxidants. Additionally, the microbial counts after 14 days of refrigeration were the lowest in burgers when the combination of OEO and SNE was used. This study concludes that OEO and SNE can be used as inhibitors of lipid oxidation in salmon products and as natural candidates to replace commonly used synthetic antioxidants and antimicrobials in these food products.">

The essential oils (EOs) obtained from the aerial parts of the samples were characterized with the object to define their phytochemical and pharmaceutical biology profile. They highlight three different chemotypes, including one never seen in previous literature (CIV17-EO, distilled from sample harvested in 2017 at Civitaretenga), that showed a fingerprinting with the predominance of (-)-limonen-10-yl-acetate (67.9%). In 2017 European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reported the genotoxicity of similar compounds, therefore, to dismiss any safety concern for the CIV17-EO use as flavouring substance, the Ames test was performed with no evidence of mutagenic activity. Safety of use coupled with chemical characterization of this new chemotype set the stage for a better standardization of &lt;i&gt;H. officinalis&lt;/i&gt; EOs. The ethanolic extracts, on the other hand, with qualitatively similar chemical profiles in which caftaric, chlorogenic and rosmarinic acid were the main molecules, showed interesting antioxidant activity and a slight cytotoxicity towards the A549 cell line that could indicate a starting point for the evaluation of an additional preventive tool for maintaining health status.">

        <span class="abst" title="The present research studied the influence of blanching and microwave pretreatment of seeds on the quality of pomegranate seed oil (PSO) extracted by cold pressing. Pomegranate seeds (cv. Acco) were independently blanched (95 ± 2 °C/3 min) and microwave heated (261 W/102 s) before cold pressing. The quality of the extracted oil was evaluated with respect to oxidation indices, refractive index, yellowness index, total carotenoids content, total phenolic content, flavor compounds, fatty acid composition, and 2.2-diphenyl-1-picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) and 2.2-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging capacity. Blanching and microwave pretreatments of seeds before pressing enhanced oil yield, total phenolic content, flavor compounds, and DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging capacity. Although the levels of oxidation indices, including the peroxide value, free fatty acids, acid value, ρ-anisidine value, and total oxidation value, also increased, and the oil quality conformed to the requirements of the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CODEX STAN 19-1981) standard for cold-pressed vegetable oils. On the other hand, blanching and microwave heating of seeds decreased the pomegranate seed oil's yellowness index, whilst the refractive index was not significantly (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &gt; 0.05) affected. Even though both blanching and microwave pretreatment of seeds added value to the cold-pressed PSO, the oil extracted from blanched seeds exhibited lower oxidation indices. Regarding fatty acids, microwave pretreatment of seeds before cold pressing significantly increased palmitic acid, oleic acid, and linoleic acid, whilst it decreased the level of punicic acid. On the contrary, blanching of seeds did not significantly affect the fatty acid composition of PSO, indicating that the nutritional quality of the oil was not significantly affected. Therefore, blanching of seeds is an appropriate and valuable step that could be incorporated into the mechanical processing of PSO.">

With the aim to individuate the constituent of the &lt;i&gt;Salvia officinalis&lt;/i&gt; responsible for the biological activity, we tested the major components of the oil: camphene, β-pinene, limonene, 1,8-cineole, cis-thujone, camphor, (E)-caryophyllene, and α-humulene. Here, we describe α-humulene as an active component that is non-cytotoxic and active against BVDV (EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 36 µM). Its antiviral effects were evaluated using virucidal cytopathic effect inhibition and viral yield reduction assays. This is the first scientific report showing the anti BVDV effects of &lt;i&gt;Salvia officinalis&lt;/i&gt; essential oil and α-humulene as the main active component.">

        <span class="abst" title="A feeding trial for 150 days was carried out to evaluate the cross-effects between oregano essential oil (EO) dietary supplementation and dynamic temperature change in sea bass. Under exposure to rising temperature (13-25 °C), fish were fed with a control diet (CD) and two experimental diets supplemented with 100 (D100) and 200 ppm (D200) of EO. Feed inclusion of EO promoted the activity of antioxidant enzymes in sea bass exposed to increasing temperature. Consistently with the temperature rise, TBARS concentrations increased in CD and D200 groups, whereas were almost stable in D100. Trend of blood glucose in fish fed on CD was likely affected by glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Similarly, the depletion of triglycerides and cholesterol in fish fed on CD likely supported the energy cost of gluconeogenesis. On the other hand, the reduction of glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol in D100 and D200 was mainly attributable to the hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects of EO. The higher levels of serum protein observed in D100 and D200 groups were also associated to a reduced thermal stress compared to CD. EO dietary supplementation may be a promising strategy to alleviate the negative effects of temperature shift on sea bass physiological and oxidative state.">

Agar diffusion method and vapor phase test showed the EOs activity with the biggest halo inhibition diameters against &lt;i&gt;A. bohemicus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B. cereus&lt;/i&gt;. A remarkably high antioxidant activity was determined for &lt;i&gt;L. nobilis&lt;/i&gt; showing low EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values and also for &lt;i&gt;S. sclarea;&lt;/i&gt; good EO results were obtained in both of the used assays. &lt;i&gt;S. officinalis&lt;/i&gt; EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values were slightly higher to which corresponds to a lower antioxidant activity.

The aim of this study is to assess the antioxidant, genotoxic, antigenotoxic and cytotoxic properties of characterized hyssop essential oils and methanol extracts. Chemical composition was analyzed by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography with diode array detection and mass spectrometry (LC-DAD-MS), respectively. Antioxidant activity was examined by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP) tests; genotoxic and antigenotoxic activity were examined by the comet assay, while cytotoxicity was evaluated by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide dye (MTT) test against tumor cell lines (SW480, MDA-MB 231, HeLa) and non-transformed human lung fibroblast cell lines (MRC-5). The essential oils were rich in monoterpene hydrocarbons (e.g., limonene; 7.99-23.81%), oxygenated monoterpenes (1,8-cineole; 38.19-67.1%) and phenylpropanoids (methyl eugenol; 0.00-28.33%). In methanol extracts, the most abundant phenolics were chlorogenic and rosmarinic acid (23.35-33.46 and 3.53-17.98 mg/g, respectively). Methanol extracts expressed moderate to weak antioxidant activity (DPPH IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 56.04-199.89 µg/mL, FRAP = 0.667-0.959 mmol Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/g). Hyssop preparations significantly reduced DNA damage in human whole blood cells, induced by pretreatment with hydrogen peroxide. Methanol extracts exhibited selective and potent dose- and time-dependent activity against the HeLa cell line. Results of the current study demonstrated notable &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;officinalis&lt;/i&gt; medicinal potential, which calls for further investigation.">

Sea buckthorn and its derived products (oil; alcoholic extracts), rich in flavonoids and essential fatty acids, are among these healthcare products. Specifically, sea buckthorn and its derivatives are reported to have antioxidant and antitumor activity in dysplastic skin cells. On the other hand, evidence suggests that the alteration of lipid metabolism is related to increased malignant behavior. Given the paradoxical involvement of lipids in health and disease, we investigated how sea-buckthorn seed oil, rich in long-chain fatty acids, modifies the proliferation of normal and dysplastic skin cells in basal conditions, as well as under ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation. Using real-time analysis of normal and dysplastic human keratinocytes, we showed that sea-buckthorn seed oil stimulated the proliferation of dysplastic cells, while it also impaired the ability of both normal and dysplastic cells to migrate over a denuded area. Furthermore, UVA exposure increased the expression of CD36/SR-B2, a long-chain fatty acid translocator that is related to the metastatic behavior of tumor cells.">

The EOs were analyzed by GC-MS and their chemical contents are presented herein. Different nanovesicles were formulated with small average sizes, high homogeneity, and optimal ζ-potential. Microscopic observation confirmed their small and spherical shape. Antibacterial and antifungal activities of the formulated EOs were evaluated against food-borne pathogens and spoilage microorganisms compared to pure EOs. Propylene glycol-nanovesicles loaded with &lt;i&gt;O. onites&lt;/i&gt; EO were found to be the most active formulation against all tested strains. Additionally, in vitro studies on the HaCaT cell line showed that nanovesicles encapsulated with EOs had no toxic effect. The present study revealed that both EOs can be used as alternative sanitizers and preservatives in the food industry, and that their formulation in nanovesicles can provide a suitable approach as food-grade delivery system.">

This is a significant threat to health, the environment, and food safety. Plant extracts in the form of essential oils are good enough to destroy pests and fight bacterial infections in animals and humans. In this review article, different essential oils containing polymeric nanofibers fabricated by electrospinning are reviewed. These nanofibers containing essential oils have shown applications in biomedical applications and as food-packaging materials. This approach of delivering essential oils in nanoformulations has attracted considerable attention in the scientific community due to its low price, a considerable ratio of surface area to volume, versatility, and high yield. It is observed that the resulting nanofibers possess antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. Therefore, they can reduce the use of toxic synthetic drugs that are utilized in the cosmetics, medicine, and food industries. These nanofibers increase barrier properties against light, oxygen, and heat, thereby protecting and preserving the food from oxidative damage. Moreover, the nanofibers discussed are introduced with naturally derived chemical compounds in a controlled manner, which simultaneously prevents their degradation. The nanofibers loaded with different essential oils demonstrate an ability to increase the shelf-life of various food products while using them as active packaging materials.">

In the last few decades, natural compounds extracted from plants have garnered the attention of scientists and the &lt;i&gt;Camellia&lt;/i&gt; species are no exception. Several species and cultivars are widespread in Asia, namely in China, Japan, Vietnam and India, being also identified in western countries like Portugal. Tea and oil are the most valuable and appreciated &lt;i&gt;Camellia&lt;/i&gt; subproducts extracted from &lt;i&gt;Camellia sinensis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Camellia oleifera&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. The economic impact of these species has boosted the search for additional information about the &lt;i&gt;Camellia&lt;/i&gt; genus. Many studies can be found in the literature reporting the health benefits of several Camellia species, namely &lt;i&gt;C. sinensis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;C. oleifera&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Camellia japonica&lt;/i&gt;. These species have been highlighted as possessing antimicrobial (antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral) and antitumoral activity and as being a huge source of polyphenols such as the catechins. Particularly, epicatechin (EC), epigallocatechin (EGC), epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG), and specially epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major polyphenols of green tea. This paper presents a detailed review of &lt;i&gt;Camellia&lt;/i&gt; species' antioxidant properties and biological activity.">

Light microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) highlighted that &lt;i&gt;M. pulegium&lt;/i&gt; indumentum consists of non-glandular and glandular trichomes of different types. Peltate trichomes of plants from the different sites showed few significant differences in dimension and abundance, but they were characterized by a surprisingly high number of secretory cells both in leaves and flowers. Phytochemical analyses showed that oxygenated monoterpenes were the most abundant class in all the EOs investigated (92.2-97.7%), but two different chemotypes, pulegone/isomenthone and piperitone/isomenthone, were found. The complex of morphological and phytochemical data indicates that soil salinity strongly affects the expression of the toxic metabolite pulegone, rather than the EO yield. Phytotoxicity tests showed a moderate activity of EOs against the selected species as confirmed by α-amylase assay. Moreover, the low toxicity on brine shrimp provided a rationale for the possible use of investigated EOs as eco-friendly herbicides.">

The plant extracts were prepared using a &quot;green&quot; method based on aqueous extraction. A total of 45 lactating ewes were allocated into three equal groups in a randomized block design. The three groups were fed the same feed allowance, roughage based on Lucerne hay and wheat straw and a concentrate based on cereals and oil cakes (the control diet). The diet of two groups was fortified with cornus extract, with or without oregano and thyme essential oils, at a level 0.515 g of plant extract/essential oils per kg of concentrate. Individual milk yield was recorded weekly and feed refusals were recorded on a pen basis daily, during a six-week period of lactation. Milk samples were analyzed for the chemical composition of protein, fat, lactose and solids-not-fat constituents, somatic cell counts and total viable bacteria counts. Moreover, the milk of each group was used for yoghurt and Feta cheese production. The lipid oxidative stability, protein carbonyl content and fatty acid composition of milk, yoghurt and cheese samples were also evaluated. The results showed that the incorporation of novel plant extracts and essential oils increased the milk production per ewe. Dietary supplementation with cornus extracts and essential oils lowered lipid and protein oxidation in milk, yoghurt and cheese samples, compared to the control. However, diet supplementation with herbal extracts did not affect the fatty acid profile in milk, cheese and yoghurt or the serum biochemical parameters. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with cornus in combination with oregano and thyme has the potential to improve feed utilization and the performance of high-yield dairy Chios cross-bred ewes reared under heat stress.">

The aim of this review was to give an overview of the ethnopharmacological uses of &lt;i&gt;Pistacia lentiscus&lt;/i&gt; L. (PlL) leaves and fruits, expanding the search for the scientific discovery of their chemistry, anti-inflammatory, antioxidative and antimicrobial activities. PlL is a wild-growing shrub rich in terpenoids and polyphenols, the oil and extracts of which have been widely used against inflammation and infections, and as wound healing agents. The more recurrent components in PlL essential oil (EO) are represented by α-pinene, terpinene, caryophyllene, limonene and myrcene, with high variability in concentration depending on the Mediterranean country. The anti-inflammatory activity of the oil mainly occurs due to the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the arachidonic acid cascade. Interestingly, the capacity against COX-2 and LOX indicates PlL EO as a dual inhibitory compound. The high content of polyphenols enriching the extracts provide explanations for the known biological properties of the plant. The protective effect against reactive oxygen species is of wide interest. In particular, their anthocyanins content greatly clarifies their antioxidative capacity. Further, the antimicrobial activity of PlL oil and extracts includes the inhibition of &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, periodontal bacteria and &lt;i&gt;Candida&lt;/i&gt; spp. In conclusion, the relevant scientific properties indicate PlL as a nutraceutical and also as a therapeutic agent against a wide range of diseases based on inflammation and infections.">

Bacterial biopolymers find applications in pathogenicity, and their diverse materialistic and chemical properties make them suitable to be used in medicinal industries. When these biopolymer compounds are obtained from pathogenic bacteria, they serve as important virulence factors, but when they are produced by non-pathogenic bacteria, they act as food components or biomaterials. There have been interdisciplinary studies going on to focus on the molecular mechanism of synthesis of bacterial biopolymers and identification of new targets for antimicrobial drugs, utilizing synthetic biology for designing and production of innovative biomaterials. This review sheds light on the mechanism of synthesis of bacterial biopolymers and its necessary modifications to be used as cell based micro-factories for the production of tailor-made biomaterials for high-end applications and their role in pathogenesis.">

The major constituents of MCEO were identified as linalool 19%, geranial 16%, citronellal 14%, neral 14%, and sabinene 12%. MCEO showed 100% mortality at 1 μg/μL against 1st instar larvae of &lt;i&gt;Ae. aegypti&lt;/i&gt; (Orlando strain, ORL), and the oil exhibited 54% (ORL) and 68% (Puerto Rico strain) mortality at 5 μg/mosquito against &lt;i&gt;Ae. aegypti&lt;/i&gt; adult females. Initial screens showed that MCEO had weak insecticidal activity compared to the positive control permethrin. In bioassays with sterile male &lt;i&gt;C. capitata&lt;/i&gt;, MCEO exhibited moderately strong attraction, comparable to that observed with a positive control, &lt;i&gt;Tetradenia riparia&lt;/i&gt; essential oil (TREO).

Essential oils (EOs) were collected in different periods (before, during, and after flowering stage) from the El-Guetfa region, M'sila, Algeria. The EOs extraction was achieved using three distinguishing techniques: hydro (Clevenger trap), steam, and microwave distillations, targeting different aerial parts of the plant (stems, flowers, and leaves). The EOs chemical components were estimated using GC-FID and GC-MS apparatuses. The resulting yield of the extracted oil was moderate and ranged between 0.84 and 1.53% (&lt;i&gt;wt&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;vol&lt;/i&gt;). In total, eighty-five components were identified, in which the oxygenated monoterpenes family formed the main portion, starting from 40.56 up to 70.66%. The obtained essential oil was dominated by five major components that varied from low to quite moderate percentages: camphor (17.45-32.56%), borneol (11.16-22.2%), camphene (7.53-12.86%), 1.8-cineole (5.16-11.21%), and bornyl acetate (3.86-7.92%). The biological results of this oil pointed out that the EOs extracted from the leaves part exposed a weak radical scavenging activity afterward using two well-known antioxidant assays DPPH (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 8.37 mg/mL) and ABTS (10.84 mg/mL). Meanwhile, this oil presented strong inhibition activity against colon cancer cell line HCT116 (LC50 = 39.8 µg/mL) and a moderate inhibitory against hepatocellular cancer cells HePG2 (LC50 &gt; 100 µg/mL). In addition, this oil antimicrobial activity was quite important against &lt;i&gt;Micrococcus luteus (M. luteus&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;i&gt;, Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; CIP 7625, &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 10536, &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; ATCC &lt;i&gt;4226&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt; IPA200, &lt;i&gt;Candida tropicalis (Ct),&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Candida glabrata (Cg)&lt;/i&gt; after using Amoxicillin and Itraconazole as references.">

HJ was taxonomically confirmed as &lt;i&gt;Z. armatum&lt;/i&gt; while MKO and MK were identified as &lt;i&gt;Z. rhetsa&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Z. myriacanthum&lt;/i&gt;. Genetic sequencing distributed these species into three groups accordingly to their confirmed species. Essential oil of the dried fruits from these samples was extracted and analyzed for their chemical and physical properties. Cluster analysis of their volatile compositions separated MKO and MK apart from HJ with L-limonene, terpinen-4-ol, &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-phellandrene, and &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-philandrene. By using odor attributes, the essential oil of MKO and MK were closely related possessing fruity, woody, and citrus aromas, while the HJ was distinctive. Overall, the phenotypic characteristic can be used to elucidate the species among makhwaen fruits of different sources. The volatile profiling was nonetheless dependent on the genotypes but makwoung and makhwaen showed similar profiles.">

In this study, the essential oils chemical characterization of eight new &lt;i&gt;L. alba&lt;/i&gt; genotypes was performed. The selected materials were collected from the Active Germplasm Bank of the Agronomic Institute and the essential oils were extracted by hydrodistillation. Flow-modulated comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC×GC-MS) was employed for chemical characterization and evaluation of possible co-eluted compounds. In addition, the chemical analyses were submitted to multivariate statistical analyses. From this investigation, 73 metabolites were identified in the essential oils of the genotypes, from which α-pinene, β-myrcene, 1,8-cineole, linalool, neral, geranial, and caryophyllene oxide were the most abundant compounds among the accessions. This is the first report disclosing α-pinene in higher amounts in &lt;i&gt;L. alba&lt;/i&gt; (19.69%). In addition, sabinene, &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-verbenol, myrtenol, (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-caryophyllene, α-guaiene, germacrene D, and α-bulnesene were also found in relevant quantities in some of the genotypes, and myrtenal and myrtenol could be well separated through the second dimension. Such results contributed to the understanding of the chemical composition of those new genotypes, being important to drive a future industrial applicability and studies in genetic breeding.">

The effects of the EOs on aphid population parameters and levels of biochemical markers of oxidative stress within insect tissues were analyzed. In laboratory bioassays, application of the studied EOs at sublethal concentrations reduced daily fecundity and led to a decrease in the intrinsic rate of natural increase in both aphid species. Treatment with EOs also induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within aphid tissues. The highest levels of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide were noted after 24 and 48 h of exposure. Moreover, a significant increase in lipid peroxidation was shown in treated aphids, especially between 48 and 72 h after exposure. The increase was more pronounced after treatment with the essential oil of &lt;i&gt;S. chamaecyparissus&lt;/i&gt;, which also exhibited higher aphicidal activity in toxicity tests. The activities of antioxidant enzymes-superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT)-were significantly elevated in both aphid species in response to the tested EOs. The obtained results suggest that oxidative stress evoked by treatment with the studied EOs may be an important factor determining their toxicity towards aphids.">

Pearson correlation and partial least square regression analyses of the EO antioxidant activity values vs. % composition of individual volatiles indicated the positive contribution of both compounds to the radical scavenging activity of bay laurel EOs.

Articles published from 2010 to 2020 were reviewed in detail to show recent updates on the antibacterial and antifungal properties of betel leaves. This current review showed that betel leaves extract, essential oil, preparations, and isolates could inhibit microbial growth and kill various Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria as well as fungal species, including those that are multidrug-resistant and cause serious infectious diseases. &lt;i&gt;P. betle&lt;/i&gt; leaves displayed high efficiency on Gram-negative bacteria such as &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;, Gram-positive bacteria such as &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt;. The ratio of MBC/MIC indicated bactericidal and bacteriostatic effects of &lt;i&gt;P. betle&lt;/i&gt; leaves, while MFC/MIC values showed fungicidal and fungistatic effects. This review also provides a list of phytochemical compounds in betel leaves extracts and essential oils, safety profiles, and value-added products of betel leaves. Some studies also showed that the combination of betel leaves extract and essential oil with antibiotics (streptomycin, chloramphenicol and gentamicin) could provide potentiating antibacterial properties. Moreover, this review delivers a scientific resume for researchers in respected areas and manufacturers who want to develop betel leaves-based products.">

Traditionally, this plant has been used to treat inflammation, pain, and respiratory problems. The rhizomes are the primary part of the plant that has been used for medicinal purposes due to their constituents with therapeutic properties, including phenylbutenoids, curcuminoids, and essential oils. Since the 1970s, many studies have been conducted on the phytochemicals and bioactivities of &lt;i&gt;Z. cassumunar&lt;/i&gt; to establish fundamental scientific evidence that supports its use in traditional medicine. The accumulated biological studies on the extracts, solvent fractions, and constituents of &lt;i&gt;Z. cassumunar&lt;/i&gt; have described their diverse medicinal properties, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, neuroprotective/neurotrophic, cosmeceutical, and antifungal/antimicrobial bioactivities.

The interactions between the goldenrod extract and antibiotics used in UTIs were established. The influence of the extract on the duration of the post-antibiotic effects (PAE) and post-antibiotic sub-MIC effects (PASME) of amikacin and ciprofloxacin were determined. Extract composition was analyzed using coupled UHPLC/MS and the spectrophotometric method. The survival of bacteria was established using the serial dilution assay. The crystal violet assay for biofilm quantification was also used. PAE and PASME were investigated using the viable count method. The obtained results indicate that &lt;i&gt;S. virgaurea&lt;/i&gt; extract limits the survival of planktonic forms of bacteria and reduces 24-h biofilm. However, the combination of &lt;i&gt;S. virgaurea&lt;/i&gt; extract with antibiotics weakens their antibacterial activity and shortens the duration of PAE and PASME. Therefore, when deciding to use a combination of &lt;i&gt;S. virgaurea&lt;/i&gt; extract and amikacin/ciprofloxacin, it is necessary to take into account their antagonistic activity.">

Incidence of &lt;i&gt;S. cucurbitacearum&lt;/i&gt; was reduced, representing a range between 67.0% in &lt;i&gt;L. nobilis&lt;/i&gt; to 84.4% in &lt;i&gt;O. majorana&lt;/i&gt; #2.

        <span class="abst" title="To date, the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide include viral infections, such as Ebola, influenza virus, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and recently COVID-19 disease, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Currently, we can count on a narrow range of antiviral drugs, especially older generation ones like ribavirin and interferon which are effective against viruses in vitro but can often be ineffective in patients. In addition to these, we have antiviral agents for the treatment of herpes virus, influenza virus, HIV and hepatitis virus. Recently, drugs used in the past especially against ebolavirus, such as remdesivir and favipiravir, have been considered for the treatment of COVID-19 disease. However, even if these drugs represent important tools against viral diseases, they are certainly not sufficient to defend us from the multitude of viruses present in the environment. This represents a huge problem, especially considering the unprecedented global threat due to the advancement of COVID-19, which represents a potential risk to the health and life of millions of people. The demand, therefore, for new and effective antiviral drugs is very high. This review focuses on three fundamental points: (1) presents the main threats to human health, reviewing the most widespread viral diseases in the world, thus describing the scenario caused by the disease in question each time and evaluating the specific therapeutic remedies currently available. (2) It comprehensively describes main phytochemical classes, in particular from plant foods, with proven antiviral activities, the viruses potentially treated with the described phytochemicals. (3) Consideration of the various applications of drug delivery systems in order to improve the bioavailability of these compounds or extracts. A PRISMA flow diagram was used for the inclusion of the works. Taking into consideration the recent dramatic events caused by COVID-19 pandemic, the cry of alarm that denounces critical need for new antiviral drugs is extremely strong. For these reasons, a continuous systematic exploration of plant foods and their phytochemicals is necessary for the development of new antiviral agents capable of saving lives and improving their well-being.">

        <span class="abst" title="Natural products have long been used as drugs to treat a wide array of human diseases. The lead compounds discovered from natural sources are used as novel templates for developing more potent and safer drugs. Natural products produce biological activity by binding with biological macromolecules, since natural products complement the protein-binding sites and natural product-protein interactions are already optimized in nature. Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) is an NAD+ dependent histone deacetylase enzyme and a unique Sirtuin family member. It plays a crucial role in different molecular pathways linked to DNA repair, tumorigenesis, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, neurodegeneration, cardiac hypertrophic responses, etc. Thus, it has emerged as an exciting target of several diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, aging, diabetes, metabolic disorder, and heart disease. Recent studies have shown that natural compounds can act as modulators of SIRT6. In the current review, a list of natural products, their sources, and their mechanisms of SIRT6 activity modulation has been compiled. The potential application of these naturally occurring SIRT6 modulators in the amelioration of major human diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, aging, diabetes, inflammation, and cancer has also been delineated. Natural products such as isoquercetin, luteolin, and cyanidin act as SIRT6 activators, whereas vitexin, catechin, scutellarin, fucoidan, etc. work as SIRT6 inhibitors. It is noteworthy to mention that quercetin acts as both SIRT6 activator and inhibitor depending on its concentration used. Although none of them were found as highly selective and potent modulators of SIRT6, they could serve as the starting point for developing selective and highly potent scaffolds for SIRT6.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Artemisia dracunculus&lt;/i&gt; L. (tarragon), Asteraceae, is a species that has long been used in traditional Asian medicine, mainly in Iran, Pakistan, Azerbaijan and India. It is known as a spice species in Asia, Europe and the Americas. The raw materials obtained from this species are herb and leaf. The presence of essential oil with a highly variable composition, as well as flavonoids, phenolic acids, coumarins and alkamides, determines the medicinal and/or spice properties of the plant. In traditional Asian medicine, this species is used, for example, in the treatment of digestive system diseases, as an analgesic, hypnotic, antiepileptic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic agent, and as an effective remedy in the treatment of helminthiasis. Nowadays, &lt;i&gt;A. dracunculus&lt;/i&gt; is the subject of professional phytochemical and pharmacological researches. Pharmacological studies have confirmed its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects known from traditional uses; they have also proved very important new findings regarding its biological activity, such as antioxidant, immunomodulating and anti-tumour activities, as well as hepatoprotective and hypoglycaemic effects. &lt;i&gt;A. dracunculus&lt;/i&gt; has long-held an established position in the food industry as a spice. And its use is growing in the cosmetics industry. Moreover, it is the subject of biotechnological research focused mainly on the development of micro-propagation protocols.">

        <span class="abst" title="Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a common inflammatory condition of the nasal mucosa and it is an immunoglobulin E-mediated disease. The incidence and prevalence of AR globally have been escalating over recent years. Antihistamines, intranasal corticosteroids, decongestants, intranasal anticholinergics, intranasal cromolyn, leukotriene receptor antagonists and immunotherapy have been used in the treatment of AR. However, there is a need to search for more effective and safer remedies as many of the current treatments have reported side effects. Medicinal plants have been used traditionally to relief symptoms of AR but their efficacy and safety have not been scientifically proven. In this review, up-to-date reports of studies on the anti-allergic rhinitis of several medicinal plants and their bioactive metabolites through suppression of the immune system are compiled and critically analyzed. The plant samples were reported to suppress the productions of immunoglobulin E, cytokines and eosinophils and inhibit histamine release. The suppression of cytokines production was found to be the main mechanistic effect of the plants to give symptomatic relief. The prospect of these medicinal plants as sources of lead molecules for development of therapeutic agents to treat AR is highlighted. Several bioactive metabolites of the plants including shikonin, okicamelliaside, warifteine, methylwarifteine, luteolin-7-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-rutinoside, tussilagone, petasin, and mangiferin have been identified as potential candidates for development into anti-allergic rhinitis agents. The data collection was mainly from English language articles published in journals, or studies from EBSCOHOST, Medline and Ovid, Scopus, Springer, and Google Scholar databases from the year 1985-2020. The terms or keywords used to find relevant studies were allergic rhinitis OR pollinosis OR hay fever, AND medicinal plant OR single plant OR single herb OR phytotherapy. This comprehensive review serves as a useful resource for medicinal plants with anti-allergic rhinitis potential, understanding the underlying mechanisms of action and for future exploration to find natural product candidates in the development of novel anti-allergic rhinitis agents.">

We hypothesize that the separation of the compounds from &lt;i&gt;Nigella sativa&lt;/i&gt; L has either a positive or negative effect on antioxidants. To study this, we explored different methods to simultaneously extract and separate compounds from &lt;i&gt;Nigella sativa&lt;/i&gt; L and performed antioxidant tests (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-carotene and DPPH) for all collected fractions.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nigella sativa&lt;/i&gt; L was hot-extracted by Soxhlet and mother extracts and was separated using silica column chromatography with adequate eluents. Qualitative phytochemical tests to determine the chemical families in &lt;i&gt;Nigella sativa&lt;/i&gt; L seeds were performed on the fractions. They were also identified and characterized by GC-MS and HPLC-DAD. Then, antioxidant activity was examined by &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-carotene bleaching and DPPH radical scavenger tests. &lt;i&gt;Results and Conclusion&lt;/i&gt;. The mother extract hexane &lt;b&gt;FH&lt;/b&gt; generated eight different fractions (&lt;b&gt;SH1-8&lt;/b&gt;) and the acetone extract &lt;b&gt;FA&lt;/b&gt; generated 11 fractions (&lt;b&gt;SA1-11&lt;/b&gt;). The &lt;b&gt;FH&lt;/b&gt; fractions had a high percentage of fatty acids, and the &lt;b&gt;FA&lt;/b&gt; fractions had some interesting polyphenols derivative compounds. Phytochemical screening revealed secondary metabolites such as polyphenols flavonoids, alkaloids, steroids, terpenes coumarins, tannins, and saponins. We found that only two solvents (hexane, acetone) of different polarities could easily extract and simultaneously separate the components of &lt;i&gt;Nigella sativa&lt;/i&gt; L. The antioxidant fractions that we collected had close activity to reference compounds but were more active than the corresponding mother extracts. Moreover, several IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of fractions from acetone extract were better than those from hexane. Therefore, the antioxidant activity of &lt;i&gt;Nigella sativa&lt;/i&gt; L is more attributed to flavonoids and polyphenols than fatty acids. In summary, the separation of hexane extract presents a more pronounced positive effect for antioxidant tests than acetone extract.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Traditional medicine is a major component in the primary healthcare system in the southeast of Iran, which has a rich floral diversity. However, there is no comprehensive report on the use of medicinal herbs in this specific region. This traditional usage of medicinal plants by local communities could serve as a source for pharmacological and phytochemical studies. The main objective of this study was to identify ethnopharmacological knowledge on medicinal plant species and their local healing applications by the folk communities of Kerman province in the southeast of Iran.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;In this cross-sectional study, data were collected from 217 herbal healers using semi-structured questionnaires, open interviews, and field surveys. Factors including use reports (UR) for each species, frequency of citation (FC), and informant consensus factor (ICF) were used to analyze the data. Plant species were identified by botanists through standard taxonomic methods.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;A total of 402 medicinal plants were used in healing practices by the local communities of Kerman province. These species belong to 273 genera of 73 families, among which 367 species are dicotyledons, 27 are monocotyledons, 7 species are cryptogam, and one species is gymnosperm. An important implication from the current study is the identification of the traditional medicinal use of 292 plant species in this region for the first time. Asteraceae, Apiaceae, Lamiaceae, and Fabaceae were the dominant medicinally utilized plant families, respectively. Leaf, flower, fruit, and seed were the most common plant parts used. Generally, crude drugs were used in the form of decoction, followed by poultice and infusion forms. Moreover, oral route is considered as the most common administration route followed by topical route. Endocrine (diabetes), dermatological, gastrointestinal, and respiratory problems were ranked as the most frequent ailment categories for which medicinal plants in this region were applied, respectively. Our findings suggested dominant use of Asteraceae and Apiaceae plants for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders, Lamiaceae plants for respiratory and gastrointestinal ailments, and Apocynaceae plants for dermatological problems.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Our findings suggested that Asteraceae and Apiaceae plants were used for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders, Lamiaceae plants for respiratory and gastrointestinal ailments, and Apocynaceae and Euphorbiaceae plants for dermatological problems. Among the medicinal plants with high UR and new ethnobotanical uses, Rhazya stricta was used for wound healing, Calotropis procera, Clematis ispahanica and Euphorbia spp. for eczema, Cionura erecta for the treatment of cough, Launaea acanthodes for the treatment of gastrointestinal parasites, Berberis integrrima as an antidiabetic medicinal herb, Dracocephalum polychaetum and Rydingia persica for various types of chronic diseases, Citrus limon and Citrus aurantium for the treatment of ocular diseases and making the traditional kohl, Calendula officinalis for the treatment of pterygium and Prosopis farcta for preventing nasal bleeding. The identified medicinal plants can be further evaluated for their pharmacological activity and underlying mechanisms of action.">

        <span class="abst" title="Zootherapy is a traditional secular practice among the Guarani-Kaiowá indigenous ethnic group living in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. My people use the oil extracted from larvae of the snout beetle Rhynchophorus palmarum (Linnaeus, 1758) to treat and heal skin wounds and respiratory diseases. Based on this ethnopharmacological knowledge, the chemical composition and antioxidant, antimicrobial, and healing properties of R. palmarum larvae oil (RPLO) were investigated, as well as possible toxic effects, through in vitro and in vivo assays. The chemical composition of the RPLO was determined using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. The antioxidant activity of RPLO was investigated through the direct 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay, and the antimicrobial activity was evaluated against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria that are pathogenic to humans. The healing properties of RPLO were investigated by performing a cell migration assay using human lung fibroblasts (MRC-5), and the toxicity was analyzed, in vivo, using a Caenorhabditis elegans model and MRC-5 cells, in vitro. RPLO contains 52.2% saturated fatty acids and 47.4% unsaturated fatty acids, with palmitic acid (42.7%) and oleic acid (40%) representing its major components, respectively. RPLO possesses direct antioxidant activity, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 46.15 mg.ml-1. The antimicrobial activity of RPLO was not observed at a concentration of 1% (v/v). RPLO did not alter the viability of MRC-5 cells and did not exert toxic effects on C. elegans. Furthermore, MRC-5 cells incubated with 0.5% RPLO showed a higher rate of cell migration than that of the control group, supporting its healing properties. Taken together, RPLO possesses direct antioxidant activity and the potential to aid in the healing process and is not toxic toward in vitro and in vivo models, corroborating the safe use of the oil in traditional Guarani-Kaiowá medicine.">

However, the antiulcer activity of essential oil derived from the seeds has not been systematically studied. This study aims to evaluate the gastroprotective activities of essential oil derived from the seed of MC induced by hydrochloride acid/ethanol (HCl/EtOH) and indomethacin and pylorus-ligation model. Gastric ulceration was induced by oral administration of HCl/EtOH solution or indomethacin on day 7 after animals have been pretreated with testing compounds. The first group received just distilled water and the second group received ranitidine (100 mg/kg). Groups 3, 4, and 5 received 10, 50, and 100 mg/kg of essential oil based on their body weight (10 mL/kg), respectively. Macroscopically, pretreatment of essential oil extracted from MC significantly decreased ulceration induced by HCl/EtOH and indomethacin &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Microscopically, essential oil also significantly suppressed the formation of edema, epithelial disruption, and mucosa erosions. Moreover, essential oil significantly elevated the pH without decreasing the total acidity of the gastric juice and was able to increase the amount of adherent mucus compared to control. Current results provide scientific basis to the ethno-pharmacological usage of the MC in preventing ulcer formation induced by HCl/EtOH and indomethacin.">

Osbeck and lime oil from &lt;i&gt;Citrus aurantiifolia&lt;/i&gt; (Christm.) Swingle, when used as sensory additives in feed for all animal species. The use of the expressed lemon oil and its residual fraction and the use of lime oil in feed is not expected to increase the exposure to furocoumarins and methoxycoumarins and perillaldehyde of those target species that are already fed citrus by-products a relevant extent (&lt; 10%). For companion animals and ornamental fish not normally exposed to citrus by-products, no conclusion can be drawn. For the other species and for the distilled fraction of expressed lemon oil, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that the additives under assessment are safe at the maximum proposed or at reduced use levels in complete feed. The Panel considers that the use in water for drinking is safe provided that the total daily intake of the additive does not exceed the daily amount that is considered safe when consumed via feed. No concerns for consumer safety were identified following the use of the additives at the maximum proposed use level in feed. The additives under assessment should be considered as irritants to skin and eyes and the respiratory tract and as skin sensitisers. Since expressed lemon oil and its fractions contain furocoumarins, they may cause phototoxicity. The use of the additives under the proposed conditions of use in animal feed is not expected to pose a risk for the environment. Since &lt;i&gt;C. limon and C. aurantiifolia&lt;/i&gt; and their preparations are recognised to flavour food and its function in feed would be essentially the same as that in food, no further demonstration of efficacy is considered necessary.">

        <span class="abst" title="Since the olden times, infectious diseases have largely affected human existence. The newly emerged infections are excessively caused by viruses that are largely associated with mammal reservoirs. The casualties of these emergencies are significantly influenced by the way human beings interact with the reservoirs, especially the animal ones. In our review we will consider the evolutionary and the ecological scales of such infections and their consequences on the public health, with a focus on the pathogenic influenza A virus. The nutraceutical properties of fungal and plant terpene-like molecules will be linked to their ability to lessen the symptoms of viral infections and shed light on their potential use in the development of new drugs. New challenging methods in antiviral discovery will also be discussed in this review. The authors believe that pharmacognosy is the &quot;wave of future pharmaceuticals&quot;, as it can be continually produced and scaled up under eco-friendly requirements. Further diagnostic methods and strategies however are required to standardise those naturally occurring resources.">

Its ethnomedicinal use in skin and mucosal lesions is commonly accepted across countries. Other utilizations reported locally include fever reduction, cardiac diseases, hypertension, urinary diseases, cough, asthma, hemorrhoids, diabetes, numbness of arm, liver disease, and cancer. Departing from the smoketree's traditional uses, this review summarizes investigations on the phytochemistry and bioactivity of the plant. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; experiments supporting wound-healing, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, cytotoxic, antioxidative, hepatoprotective, and antidiabetic effects are presented. Metabolites from smoketree that are responsible for the main pharmacological effects of smoketree are pointed out. Furthermore, the review performs a comparison between &lt;i&gt;C. coggygria&lt;/i&gt; and the lacquer tree (&lt;i&gt;Toxicodendron vernicifluum&lt;/i&gt;). The latter is a comprehensively studied species used in Asian phytotherapy, with whom the European smoketree shares a consistent pool of secondary metabolites. The comparative approach aims to open new perspectives in the research of smoketree and anticipates an optimized use of C. coggygria in therapy. It also points out the relevance of a chemosystematic approach in the field of medicinal plants research.">

        <span class="abst" title="Several studies have assessed the potential of essential oils as substitutes for synthetic pesticides, in order to counter insect resistance to commercial pesticides. Piper aduncum L. is a very common shrub in the Amazon Rainforest and in other subtropical areas. The objective of this review was to analyse the existing information on P. aduncum essential oil as a raw material for new bioproducts for sustainable pest disease management. With this review, we collected and critically analysed 59 papers, representing all the studies that aimed to evaluate the essential oil properties of this species as an insecticide, acaricide and antiparasitic. The chemical composition differs depending on the origin, although phenylpropanoid dillapiole is the most cited component, followed by myristicin, 1,8-cineole and β-ocimene. Between the acaricidal, antiparasitic and synergistic activities, the insecticidal effects are highly promising, with optimal results against the malaria vector Aedes aegypti, with an LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; that ranges between 57 and 200μg/mL. Acaricidal activity has mainly been reported against Tetranychus urticae, showing an LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; that ranges between 5.83 and 7.17μg/mL. Antiparasitic activity has predominately been found on Leishmania amazonensis, and antipromastigote activity has been found to be between 23.8 and 25.9μg/mL. Concerning the synergistic effect between dillapiole and synthetic insecticides, four studies on Spodoptera frugiperda found promising results with cypermethrin. In this review, we highlighted the potential of P. aduncum essential oil as a biopesticide, also focusing on the lack of information about applied research. We also provide suggestions for future investigations.">

(M. communis L.) leaves were conducted to investigate their effects on the levels of phenolic compounds, antioxidant capacity of ethanolic extracts (EEs) as well as the soybean oil oxidative stability. Drying methodology significantly influenced the extractability of phenolic compounds. Microwave drying led to an increase in the amounts of total phenols, flavonoids and proanthocyanidins followed by oven drying at 70 °C. Higher temperature of drying (100 and 120 °C) led to a significant reduction of their amounts (p &lt; 0.05). An ultra-performance liquid chromatography method combined with high resolution mass spectroscopic detection was used to analyze the phenolic fraction of extracts. Higher amounts of the identified compounds were observed when leaves were heat treated. Furthermore, the evaluation of the antioxidant activity showed that the studied extracts possess in general high antioxidant capacities, significantly dependent on the employed drying methodology. The incorporation of the different extracts at 200 ppm in soybean oil showed that its oxidative stability was significantly improved. Extracts from leaves treated with microwave (EE_MW) and at 70 °C (EE_70) have better effect than BHT. The results of the present study suggest that microwave drying could be useful to enhance the extractability of phenolic compounds and the antioxidant capacity of M. communis L. leaf extract.">

Presently, under the concept of integrated pest management, all possible plant pest and disease control methods are integrated to minimize the excessive use of synthetic chemicals and also the incidence of disease. The potential of various essential oils against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi is being actively investigated in various laboratories across the world. Rice the most important crop, suffers from huge yield losses due to blast and blight diseases. Most of the labs have focussed to use transgenic approaches, the use of environmentally friendly natural products, as disease control strategies. In this context, we propose to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of essential oils and their ability to control diseases of rice. Seven Essential oils from seven different plants were selected for the study. The antimicrobial activity was assessed in terms of their antibacterial activity towards non-pathogenic bacteria and pathogenic drug resistant bacteria by means of their ability to sensitize the drug resistant bacteria in plasmid curing and, ß-lactamase inhibition and as antifungal agents. In conclusion, out of the seven essential oils used, lemongrass, palm rosa and eucalyptus were found to be good antimicrobial agents.">

MO is a perennial aromatic herb commonly known as lemon balm, honey balm, or bee balm, which belongs to &lt;i&gt;Lamiaceae&lt;/i&gt; family. Active components are mainly located in the leaves or essential oil and include volatile compounds, terpenoid (monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, triterpenes), and polyphenolic compounds [rosmarinic acid (RA), caffeic acid, protocatechuic acid, quercitrin, rhamnocitrin, luteolin]. For centuries, MO has been traditionally used as a remedy for memory, cognition, anxiety, depression, and heart palpitations. Up until now, several beneficial cardiovascular effects of MO, in the form of extracts (aqueous, alcoholic, and hydroalcoholic), essential oil, and isolated compounds, have been confirmed in preclinical animal studies, such as antiarrhythmogenic, negative chronotropic and dromotropic, hypotensive, vasorelaxant, and infarct size-reducing effects. Nonetheless, MO effects on heart palpitations are the only ones confirmed in human subjects. The main mechanisms proposed for the cardiovascular effects of this plant are antioxidant free radical-scavenging properties of MO polyphenols, amelioration of oxidative stress, anti-inflammatory effects, activation of M2 and antagonism of β1 receptors in the heart, blockage of voltage-dependent Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels, stimulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthesis, prevention of fibrotic changes, etc. Additionally, the main active ingredient of MO-RA, &lt;i&gt;per se&lt;/i&gt;, has shown substantial cardiovascular effects. Because of the vastness of encouraging data from animal studies, this plant, as well as the main ingredient RA, should be considered and investigated further as a tool for cardioprotection and adjuvant therapy in patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases.">

UC treatment is lifelong, therefore; the potential side effects and cost of the therapy are significant. Yarrow is a promising medicinal plant with the ability to treat many disorders, owing to its bioactive compounds especially the essential oil. The main aim of this research was to investigate the therapeutic effect of the yarrow oil on colitis including the involved mechanism of action.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;In 21-female C57BL/6 mice were divided into 3 groups; control group, colitis model group, and oil-treated group. Groups 2 and 3 received 5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for 9 days, and concomitantly, only group 3 was given 100 mg/kg yarrow oil. Mice were examined for their body weight, stool consistency and bleeding, and the disease activity indexes were calculated.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Oral administration of yarrow oil markedly repressed the severity of UC via the reduction of the inflammatory signs and restoring colon length. The oil was able to down-regulate nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), up-regulate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), and enhance transforming growth factor-β expression. The oil normalized the tumor necrosis factor-α expression, restored the normal serum level of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and reduced the serum level of IL-6.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Yarrow oil mitigated UC symptoms and regulated the inflammatory cytokines secretion via regulation of NF-κB and PPAR-γ pathways in the mice model, however, this recommendation requires further investigations using clinical studies to confirm the use of the oil on humans.">

Besides, the F-EO, L-EO, and S-EO significantly inhibited the production of proinflammatory mediator nitric oxide (NO) (93.15-94.72%) and cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) (23.99-77.81%) and tumor necrosis factor-&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; (TNF-&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;) (17.69-24.93%) in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells at the dose of 128 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL in the absence of cytotoxicity. Hence, the essential oils of &lt;i&gt;R. beesianus&lt;/i&gt; flower, leaf, and stem could be used as natural antibacterial and anti-inflammatory agents with a high application potential in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic fields.">

        <span class="abst" title="Multipurpose herbal teas with numerous ingredients, in which flowers are the main component, are common in the traditional medicine and pharmacy of Greece and the Eastern Mediterranean countries. In this study, we combine ethnobotany and ethnopharmacology field work techniques and botany and pharmacognosy laboratory methods for the study of traditional herbal mixtures with flowers, we identify their botanical ingredients and record the local medicinal uses of these mixtures, in Greece, Lebanon, Syria, Iran and Turkey. These, and their industrial versions, are analyzed, using morphological and multivariate analysis techniques in order to determine marker species, relevant patterns of combination and local styles. The medicinal properties attributed to the different flowers are discussed in relation with their role in the mixtures. These blends are consumed for their relaxing, digestive, and anti-infective properties. These mixtures are not consumed as a treatment when one is sick but rather to avoid getting sick, as a preventive measure. The formulations can reach forty ingredients (&lt;i&gt;sarantha&lt;/i&gt; in Greek, &lt;i&gt;arbain&lt;/i&gt; in Arabic language of Palestine), usually entire or coarsely chopped in the more traditional formulations, leading to extreme variability of individual doses. We ask what biological signification this randomness can have. To give an answer requires new and more comprehensive pharmacological approaches. The flowers of Rosaceae, Asteraceae, Lamiaceae, Malvaceae and Fabaceae species characterize these mixtures in which other materials (roots, leaves, and fruits) and other species are present as well. Flowers of some species, particularly of Fabaceae, are exclusively used in mixtures, and their use in monospecific herbal teas is not yet recorded. We draw attention on the urgent need in exhaustively recording in Greece and the Near East, the formulation and use of traditional herbal mixtures and their numerous local variants. To consider these mixtures and the contribution of flowers (most mixtures receive the general name of tea of flowers) merits further extensive study.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Globally, the application of medicinal plants in the management of acute and chronic wounds can be considered a common occurrence in most traditional medicine practices. In view of this, many plants in the tropical and subtropical regions have been screened for their wound-healing activities. Consequently, plants having antimicrobial activity against multidrug-resistant (MD-R) pathogens can be considered great assets. Therefore, this study evaluated ethanolic and aqueous extracts of five medicinal plants (&lt;i&gt;Psidium guajava&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Myrianthus arboreus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Alchornea cordifolia&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Momordica charantia&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Justicia flava&lt;/i&gt;) for their antimicrobial activities against MD-R bacterial pathogens isolated from post-operative wounds; Methods: This involved the aqueous and ethanolic extraction of the selected medicinal plants. Preliminary phytochemical constituents of the plants were examined. The agar well diffusion method was then used to determine the antibacterial activity of the leaves against reference strains (&lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 25922, &lt;i&gt;Salmonella typhi&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 19430, &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 27853 and &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 25923, and a Methicillin-Resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; strain) as well as the MDR clinical isolates (&lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;CoNS&lt;/i&gt;) from the wounds; Results: The preliminary phytochemical analysis of the leaves showed the presence of saponins, phenolics, and reducing sugars in almost all the plants tested. All plant extracts were observed to have some antimicrobial activity against at least one reference strain. For the clinical MDR isolates, &lt;i&gt;A. cordifolia&lt;/i&gt; from this study showed highest inhibition to growth of all bacteria used. Activity of &lt;i&gt;J. flava&lt;/i&gt; against &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; was highest as compared to that of &lt;i&gt;E.coli&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;. Similar observation was made for &lt;i&gt;M. arboreus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;P. guajava&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;M. charantia&lt;/i&gt; where the highest activity was observed against &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt;; Conclusion: This study has mainly shown that &lt;i&gt;P. guajava&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;M. arboreus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;A. cordifolia&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;M. charantia&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;J. flava&lt;/i&gt; exhibits antimicrobial activities against MD-R bacterial pathogens isolated from post-operative wounds. Also, these plants has bioactive phytochemical compounds with potential medicinal values for the treatment of numerous infections. Therefore, these plants may be helpful in the management of acute and chronic wounds, especially in traditional medicine practices.">

One of the main strength of the use of &lt;i&gt;Nigella&lt;/i&gt; is that the seeds are rich in the omega-6 fatty acid linoleic acid and provide an extra-source of dietary phytochemicals, including the bioactive thymoquinone, and characteristics saponins, alkaloids, and flavonoids. Among &lt;i&gt;Nigella&lt;/i&gt; species, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;sativa&lt;/i&gt; L. is the most studied plant from the genus. Due to the phytochemical composition and pharmacological properties, the seed and seed oil from this plant can be considered as good candidates to formulate functional ingredients on the basis of folklore and scientific knowledge. Nonetheless, the main limations are that more studies, especially, clinical trials are required to standardize the results, e.g. to establish active molecules, dosage, chemical profile, long-term effects and impact of cooking/incorporation into foods.">

The respiratory disease is the most consequential global public health crisis of the 21st century whose level of negative impact increasingly experienced globally has not been recorded since World War II. Up till now, there has been no specific globally authorized antiviral drug, vaccines, supplement or herbal remedy available for the treatment of this lethal disease except preventive measures, supportive care and non-specific treatment options adopted in different countries via divergent approaches to halt the pandemic. However, many of these interventions have been documented to show some level of success particularly the Traditional Chinese Medicine while there is paucity of well reported studies on the impact of the widely embraced Traditional African Medicines (TAM) adopted so far for the prevention, management and treatment of COVID-19. We carried out a detailed review of publicly available data, information and claims on the potentials of indigenous plants used in Sub-Saharan Africa as antiviral remedies with potentials for the prevention and management of COVID-19. In this review, we have provided a holistic report on evidence-based antiviral and promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 properties of African medicinal plants based on &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; evidence, &lt;i&gt;in vitro assays&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; experiments alongside the available data on their mechanistic pharmacology. In addition, we have unveiled knowledge gaps, provided an update on the effort of African Scientific community toward demystifying the dreadful SARS-CoV-2 micro-enemy of man and have documented popular anti-COVID-19 herbal claims emanating from the continent for the management of COVID-19 while the risk potentials of herb-drug interaction of antiviral phytomedicines when used in combination with orthodox drugs have also been highlighted. This review exercise may lend enough credence to the potential value of African medicinal plants as possible leads in anti-COVID-19 drug discovery through research and development.">

        <span class="abst" title="COVID-19 (coronavirus disease) is a global pandemic that started in China in 2019 and has negatively affected all economic sectors of the world, including agriculture. However, according to estimates in different countries, agriculture has suffered less than other sectors such as construction, industry and tourism, so agricultural development can be a good option to compensate for the economic damage caused to other sectors. The quality of available water and soil resources for agricultural development is not only limited, but is also decreasing incrementally, so the use of saline and unconventional soil and water resources is inevitable. Biosaline agriculture or haloculture is a system in which highly saline water and soil resources are used sustainably for the economic production of agricultural crops. It seems that in the current situation of the world (with COVID-19's impact on agriculture on the one hand and the quantitative and qualitative decline of freshwater and soil on the other), haloculture with a re-reading of territorial capabilities has good potential to provide a part of human food supply. In this review article, the potential of haloculture to offset the adverse impacts of the pandemic is analyzed from five perspectives: increasing the area under cultivation, using unconventional water, stabilizing dust centers, increasing the body's immune resistance, and reducing losses in agribusiness due to the coronavirus. Overall, haloculture is an essential system, which COVID-19 has accelerated in the agricultural sector.">

An in vitro batch fermentation experiment (Exp. 1) tested the addition of all of the substances (2 essential oils and 3 compounds) in fermentation bottles (120 mL) at 48 h of incubation, whereas a subsequent in vitro continuous culture experiment (Exp. 2) evaluated the pure compounds added to the fermenters (2 L) for a longer incubation period (9 d).

Each treatment was tested in duplicate and was repeated in 3 and 2 fermentation runs in Exp. 1 and 2, respectively. Gas production (GP) in Exp. 1 was similar for all of the treatments, and short chain volatile fatty acid (SCFA) production was similar in both experiments except for a decrease of SCFA produced (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.029) due to EUCA addition in Exp. 2.

In Exp. 1, methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) as a proportion of the GP was lowered (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.004) by the addition of CAM and EUCA compared to CTR, whereas in Exp. 2, EUCA reduced the amount of stoichiometrically calculated CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; compared to CTR. Overall, essential oils extracted from &lt;i&gt;A. moschata&lt;/i&gt; and the pure compounds did not depress in vitro rumen fermentation, except for EUCA in Exp. 2. In both experiments, an increase of the protozoal population occurred for all the additives.">

A total of 200 Japanese quails at 1-week-old were haphazardly allotted to 5 groups of 40 chicks in five replicates (8 per replicate). The first group was the control group, while LGEO was added at levels of 150, 300, 450, and 600 mg/kg diet in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th groups, respectively. Dietary supplementation of LGEO (150, 300 and 450 mg/ kg diet) increased body weight at 3 and 5 wk of age, and increased body weight gain during all periods compared with the control group (P &lt; 0.05). All levels of LGEO improved feed conversion ratio during the periods from 1 to 3 and 1 to 5 wk of age. During 3 to 5 wk, feed conversion ratio was improved in quails fed LGEO (300 and 450 mg/kg diet) compared with the control and other treatments. Carcass traits, plasma globulin, alanine aminotransferase, and urea values did not differ among the treatments (P &gt; 0.05), but the activity of aspartate aminotransferase in the plasma was significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.05) in LGEO-treated groups. The total protein and albumin values were significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05) in quails fed levels of LGEO (except 600 mg/kg diet) compared with the control. The inclusion of LGEO in quail diets improved (P &lt; 0.05) plasma lipid profile. The dietary supplementation of LGEO increased (linear and quadratic, P &lt; 0.05) plasma immunoglobulins (IgM, IgG, and IgA) levels, lysozyme values and activities of superoxide dismutase, total antioxidant capacity, reduced glutathione and catalase compared with the control group. The caecal Coliform, E. coli and Salmonella were lowered (P &lt; 0.0001) in the quails treated with all LGEO levels, but the total bacterial count and Lactobacillus count were increased with dietary supplementation of LGEO levels (300 and 450 mg/kg) compared with those in the control group. The activities of digestive enzymes were significantly higher in birds fed the diet supplemented with LGEO levels than those fed the control diet. In conclusion, dietary supplementation of LGEO can improve the performance, lipid profile, immunity and antioxidant indices and decline intestinal pathogens and thus boost the health status of growing quail.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Anethum graveolens&lt;/i&gt;, belonging to the family Apiaceae, has been extensively used for medicinal and therapeutic purposes since long. Plants encompass rich number of effective constituents with less toxicity. Thus, nowadays, the attempts are being made to search plant constituents that can prevent and reverse the chronic diseases, such as cancer. In this study, an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; antioxidant and anticancer efficacies of &lt;i&gt;Anethum graveolens&lt;/i&gt; (AG-ME) were studied on human breast (MCF-7), lung (A-549), and cervical (HeLa) carcinoma cell lines. The antioxidant efficacies of AG-ME were evaluated by total antioxidant, DPPH radical scavenging, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; scavenging, and ferrous reducing antioxidant assays. Further, the anticancer potential of AG-ME was also determined against different cancer cell lines. The AG-ME exhibited strong antioxidant activities as observed by antioxidant assays. AG-ME also showed a dose-dependent anticancer/cytotoxic potential against MCF-7, A-549, and HeLa cell lines. The AG-ME-induced reduction in GSH and increase in SOD activities indicates the role of oxidative stress in AG-ME-induced MCF-7 cell death. The results also exhibited that AG-ME triggered ROS production and significantly reduced MMP level. Moreover, a dose-dependent increase in caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities suggests that the AG-ME-induced MCF-7 cell death is caspase-dependent. Together, the present study provides reasoning and reassurance for the uses of &lt;i&gt;A. graveleons&lt;/i&gt; for medical purposes as an antioxidant and anticancer agent. Additional investigations are required to examine biological and anticancer activities under an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; system to discover a possible beneficial use of AG-ME against diseases.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Trachyspermum ammi is one of the key medicinal plant species with many beneficial properties. Thymol is the most important substance in the essential oil of this plant. Thymol is a natural monoterpene phenol with high anti-microbial, anti-bacterial, and anti-oxidant properties. Thymol in the latest research has a significant impact on slowing the progression of cancer cells in human. In this research, embryos were employed as convenient explants for the fast and effectual regeneration and transformation of T. ammi. To regenerate this plant, Murashige and Skoog (MS) and Gamborg's B5 (B5) media were supplemented with diverse concentrations of plant growth regulators, such as 6-benzyladenine (BA), 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), and kinetin (kin). Transgenic Trachyspermum ammi plants were also obtained using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and zygotic embryos explants. Moreover, two Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains (EHA101 and LBA4404) harboring pBI121-TPS2 were utilized for genetic transformation to Trachyspermum ammi.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;According to the obtained results, the highest plant-regeneration frequency was obtained with B5 medium supplemented with 0.5 mg/l BA and 1 mg/l NAA. The integrated gene was also approved using the PCR reaction and the Southern blot method. Results also showed that the EHA101 strain outperformed another strain in inoculation time (30 s) and co-cultivation period (1 day) (transformation efficiency 19.29%). Furthermore, HPLC method demonstrated that the transformed plants contained a higher thymol level than non-transformed plants.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;In this research, a fast protocol was introduced for the regeneration and transformation of Trachyspermum ammi, using zygotic embryo explants in 25-35 days. Our findings confirmed the increase in the thymol in the aerial part of Trachyspermum ammi. We further presented an efficacious technique for enhancing thymol content in Trachyspermum ammi using Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation system that can be beneficial in genetic transformation and other plant biotechnology techniques.">

        <span class="abst" title="Plants with medicinal properties play an increasingly important role in food and pharmaceutical industries for their functions on disease prevention and treatment. This study characterizes the phenolic composition and antioxidant activity of seven medicinal and food plants, including the leaves of Salvia officinalis L., Rosmarinus officinalis L., Olea europaea L., and Punica granatum L., as well as the leaves and young stems of Ruta graveolens L., Mentha piperita L., and Petroselinum crispum, Mill., by using colorimetric, chromatographic, and spectrophotometric assays. Results revealed that the hydro-methanolic leaf extracts of P. granatum (pomegranate) displayed the highest content of total phenols (199.26 mg gallic acid per gram of plant dry weight), ortho-diphenols (391.76 mg gallic acid per gram of plant dry weight), and tannins (99.20 mg epicatechin per gram of plant dry weight), besides a higher content of flavonoids (24 mg catechin per gram of plant dry weight). The highest antioxidant capacity measured by ABTS, DPPH, and FRAP (2.14, 2.27, and 2.33 mM Trolox per gram of plant dry weight, respectively) methods was also obtained in pomegranate leaf extracts, being 4-200 times higher than the other species. Such potent antioxidant activity of pomegranate leaves can be ascribed to the presence of different types of phenolic compounds and the high content in tannins, whilst phenolic acids and flavonoids were found to be the dominant phenolic classes of the other six plants. Consequently, despite the well-known antioxidant properties of these plant species, our study suggests pomegranate leaf can stand out as a relatively more valuable plant source of natural bioactive molecules for developing novel functional food-pharma ingredients, with potential for not only promoting human health but also improving bio-valorization and environment.">

The extracts of the leaves and roots of O. cufodontii after silica gel column chromatography furnished compounds 1-5, compounds 3 and 4 are new natural products. The oil from the hydro-distillation of the leaves, after analyzed with GC-MS, has led to the identification of β-caryophyllene as a principal component, suggesting the essential oil as medicine and spices to enhance the taste of food. The constituents of O. cufodontii were assessed for their antibacterial activity against E. coli, K. pneumonia, S. typhymurium and S. aureus. The best activity was displayed against S. aureus by the hexane extract of the roots, compound 4, and the essential oil with an inhibition zone of 17, 15, and 19 mm, respectively. Molecular docking analysis revealed that compound 1 has better docking efficiency and forms hydrophobic interactions with five amino acids (ARG192, PHE196, GLU185, GLU193, and LYS189). This suggests that the compounds may act as potential inhibitors of DNA gyrase. The constituents were also assessed for their antioxidant activities using DPPH, ferric thicyanate and ferric reducing power assay. The hexane extracts of the roots inhibited the DPPH radical and peroxide formation by 90.5 and 83%, respectively, suggesting the potential of the extract as an antioxidant. Furthermore, the hexane extract of the roots of O. cufodontii exhibited the maximum reducing power compared with the EtOAc and methanol extracts. Hence, the activity displayed herein indicated as the plant has great potential as a remedy for diseases caused by bacteria and radicals.">

Therefore, it has become a focus area for further research. The studies on postprandial lipemia mainly include TG, TRL, VLDL, CM, and remnant cholesterol. Diurnal triglyceride patterns and postprandial hyperlipidemia are very relevant and are now insufficiently covered. The possible mechanisms between postprandial lipemia and cardiovascular disease have been reviewed in this article by referring to relevant literature in recent years. The research progress on the effects of postprandial lipemia on endothelial function, oxidative stress, and inflammation is highlighted. The intervention of postprandial lipemia is discussed. Non-medicinal intervention such as diet and exercise improves postprandial lipemia. As medicinal intervention, statin, fibrate, ezetimibe, omega-3 fatty acids, and niacin have been found to improve postprandial lipid levels. Novel medications such as pemafibrate, PCSK9, and apoCIII inhibitors have been the focus of research in recent years. Gut microbiota is closely related to lipid metabolism, and some studies have indicated that intestinal microorganisms may affect lipid metabolism as environmental factors. Whether intervention of gut microbiota can reduce postprandial lipemia, and therefore against AS, may be worthy of further study.">

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the antioxidant and antihyperglycemic effects of the aqueous extract and of the essential oil of &lt;i&gt;Thymus serrulatus&lt;/i&gt;. The chemical composition of the aqueous extract was determined by LC-MS and the essential oil was characterized by GC-MS analysis. Radical scavenging assays, namely scavenging of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;), hydroxyl (&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH), and nitric oxide (&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;NO), were used as a first approach to screen the potential antioxidant abilities of the samples. Alpha-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitory studies were also employed to evaluate the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; antihyperglycemic potential of the plant. The &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; blood glucose lowering effect of the extracts was assessed using hypoglycemic activity and the oral glucose tolerance test in normal and in streptozotocin induced diabetic mice. When compared to the aqueous extract, the essential oil showed superior radical scavenging activity, particularly for &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;NO, as well as greater inhibitory potency against α-amylase and α-glucosidase (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.01 mg/ml and 0.11 mg/ml, respectively). Both tested samples showed a statistically significant antihyperglycemic effect. The aqueous extract at 600 mg/kg exerted maximum antihyperglycemic activity (44.14%), followed by the essential oil (30.82%). Body weight and glucose tolerance parameters were also improved by the samples both in normal and diabetic mice. The findings of this study support the hypothesis that aqueous extract and essential oil of &lt;i&gt;T. serrulatus&lt;/i&gt; are promising therapeutic agents.">

For this reason, PE films were coated with MC-HPMC solution containing different concentrations of menthol and carvacrol (0, 1, 1.5, and 2%), and mechanical, electromagnetic, barrier, and antimicrobial properties of all prepared films were examined. The obtained results demonstrated that by increasing the concentration of menthol and carvacrol in film coatings, tensile strength (from 36 to 23 MPa), water vapor permeability (from 12 to 11 g.m&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;Pa&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), and L* and b* indexes were decreased, while the oxygen permeability (OP) and elongation at break significantly were increased (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; .05). Increment of menthol and carvacrol concentration in PE film coating leads to an increase in the antimicrobial activity of films against &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Listeria innocua,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cervicea&lt;/i&gt;.

The results revealed that beef slice coated with CEO-loaded LPSM edible coating had a significant inhibitory effect on its lipid oxidation and microbial growth. The CEO-LPSM coating also inhibited the weight and texture losses of beef slices during display more efficiently compared with the control and CEO-free LPSM coating. Besides, the beef slices coated with CEO-LPSM were the preferred samples in terms of sensory scores throughout the storage. Thus, using CEO-rich LPSM edible coating might inhibit decay and significantly improve the shelf life of fresh beef.">

These are important medicinal plants which grow all over the world and are known for their flavoring and therapeutic effects and &lt;i&gt;Stachys lavandulifolia&lt;/i&gt; is an endemic species of Iran. To acquire high-quality essential oil (EO), drying technique was implemented which is an essential part of this process. The present study designed to evaluate the influences of different drying techniques (fresh sample, shade, sunlight, freeze-drying, microwave, and oven-drying (40, 60, and 80°C) on EO yield and composition of &lt;i&gt;S. lavandulifolia&lt;/i&gt;. The results indicated that the maximum EO yield was obtained by the shade-drying method. The main compounds found in the fresh samples were spathulenol, myrcene, β-pinene, δ-cadinene, and α-muurolol, while spathulenol, cyrene, δ-cadinene, p-cymene, decane, α-terpinene, β-pinene, and intermedeol were found to be the dominant compounds in the dry samples. Drying techniques were found to have a significant impact on the values of the main compositions, for example, monoterpene hydrocarbons such as α-pinene, β-pinene, myrcene, and β-phellandrene were significantly reduced by microwave drying, oven-drying (40, 60, and 80°C), and sunlight-drying methods. Drying techniques increased the antioxidant activity of &lt;i&gt;S. lavandulifolia&lt;/i&gt; EOs especially those acquired by freeze-drying with the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) values 101.8 ± 0.8 mg/ml in DPPH assay and 315.2 ± 2.1 mg/ml in decreasing power assay. As a result, shade-, sun-, and oven-drying (40°C) were found to be the most important techniques for attaining maximum yields of EO.">

Thus, here the outcome of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas fluorescence&lt;/i&gt; (ATCC-17400) inoculation was studied in the pot culture experiment. Primarily, there seems to be a promising opportunity of AMF in sesame under pot and field trials because of enhanced morphological parameters, especially root weight, and disparities in nutrients and metabolites. The AMF appears to be an option to boost plant growth, mineral content, and sesame yield. The AMF treatment with &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas fluorescence&lt;/i&gt; strain (ATCC-17400) determined the maximum values for the morphological traits and mineral content.

The total phenolic content (TPC) in the MFDE was 120.64 mg GAE/g. The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed the presence of a plethora of phenolic compounds, including hydroxycinnamic acids and flavone derivatives in the MFDE, with rosmarinic acid and luteolin-7-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glucoside being the main components. With an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 0.285 mg/mL, it was found to be a strong DPPH radical scavenger. The acute toxicity study results indicate that the oral administration of MFDE to rats at the doses of 500-5,000 mg/kg did not produce any side effects or death in animals which indicates its safety. The results of the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; assay showed that the MFDE dose-dependently inhibited paw oedema and significantly reduced the number of writings in mice induced by the acetic acid injection suggesting its potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities, respectively.

The objective was to have healthy tasty snacks with ≥24% protein content. Gluten-free, whole grain, high protein, Sorghum-Peanut meal-Okra (SPO) and SPO-Jalapeno, SPO-Turmeric root and SPO-Ginger root snacks were sensory evaluated by 73 volunteers. Physical testing of the snacks included water activity, true and bulk density, texture and proximate analyses. Taste and Odor of the SPO and SPO-Jalapeno snacks were similar and significantly (p ≤ 0.05) higher than SPO-Turmeric root and SPO-Ginger root. Acceptability of SPO and SPO-Jalapeno snacks were both 88%; this value is quite desirable. Acceptability of SPO-Turmeric and SPO-Ginger were only 56 and 51% respectively. Turmeric and ginger have been reported with many health benefits; however these snacks were not preferred by the tasters. Water activity (Aw) of the snacks tested was SPO (0.42) &lt; SPO-Turmeric (0.52) &lt; SPO-Jalapeno (0.54) &lt; SPO-Ginger (0.62). Water activity indicates that all the snacks were crispy and had longer shelf life. Expansion of these snacks was SPO-Ginger root 84%, SPO-Turmeric root 76%, SPO-Jalapeno 42% and SPO only 14%. Data suggest snacks containing spices were fluffy and would give good presentation in packaging. The objective of attaining protein level was clearly attained, as values ranged 24-26%.

Biofilms are made by the sessile microorganisms attached to the abiotic or biotic surfaces, enclosed in a matrix of exopolymeric substances. This results in new phenotypic characteristics and intrinsic resistance from both host immune response and antimicrobial drugs. &lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt; biofilm is a complex association of hyphal cells that are associated with both abiotic and animal tissues. It is an invasive fungal infection and acts as an important virulent factor. The challenges linked with biofilm-associated diseases have urged scientists to uncover the factors responsible for the formation and maturation of biofilm. Several strategies have been developed that could be adopted to eradicate biofilm-associated infections. This article presents an overview of the role of &lt;i&gt;C. albicans&lt;/i&gt; biofilm in its pathogenicity, challenges it poses and threats associated with its formation. Further, it discusses strategies that are currently available or under development targeting prostaglandins, quorum-sensing, changing surface properties of biomedical devices, natural scaffolds, and small molecule-based chemical approaches to combat the threat of &lt;i&gt;C. albicans&lt;/i&gt; biofilm.

Since antiquity many extractive techniques have been developed to obtain essential oils. Some of them are still applied, but new ones, like microwave or ultrasound-assisted extractions, are more and more popular and they save time and cost. Independently of the procedure, the resulting essential oils are the source of many so-called isolates. These can be applied as food additives, medicines, or can be used as starting materials for organic synthesis. Some substances exist in very small amounts in plant material so the extraction is not economically profitable but, after their chemical structures were established and synthetic procedures were developed, in some cases they are prepared on an industrial scale. The substances described below are only a small fraction of the 2000-3000 fragrant molecules used to make our life more enjoyable, either in food or perfumes.

        <span class="abst" title="Natural compounds such as essential oils and tea have been used successfully in naturopathy and folk medicine for hundreds of years. Current research is unveiling the molecular role of their antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. Nevertheless, the effect of these compounds on bacteriophages is still poorly understood. The application of bacteriophages against bacteria has gained a particular interest in recent years due to, e.g., the constant rise of antimicrobial resistance to antibiotics, or an increasing awareness of different types of microbiota and their potential contribution to gastrointestinal diseases, including inflammatory and malignant conditions. Thus, a better knowledge of how dietary products can affect bacteriophages and, in turn, the whole gut microbiome can help maintain healthy homeostasis, reducing the risk of developing diseases such as diverse types of gastroenteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, or even cancer. The present review summarizes the effect of dietary compounds on the physiology of bacteriophages. In a majority of works, the substance class of polyphenols showed a particular activity against bacteriophages, and the primary mechanism of action involved structural damage of the capsid, inhibiting bacteriophage activity and infectivity. Some further dietary compounds such as caffeine, salt or oregano have been shown to induce or suppress prophages, whereas others, such as the natural sweeter stevia, promoted species-specific phage responses. A better understanding of how dietary compounds could selectively, and specifically, modulate the activity of individual phages opens the possibility to reorganize the microbial network as an additional strategy to support in the combat, or in prevention, of gastrointestinal diseases, including inflammation and cancer.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Lavandula angustifolia&lt;/i&gt;, one of the most popular medicinal plants, is the source of a bioactive essential oil characterized by a wide spectrum of biological activity, e.g., antiseptic, analgesic, and anticancer effects. In dermatology, the oil helps to relieve skin inflammation and exhibit wound healing potential. However, the mechanism of action of the lavender oil depends on its composition, which in turn is dependent on the origin and growing conditions. Our study aimed to compare the composition and proregenerative properties of the commercially-available narrow-leaved lavender oil produced in Provence, France, with the oil obtained from the narrow-leaved lavender cultivated locally in Poland. GC/MS analysis showed that self-manufactured essential oil had lower linalool content than commercial oil (23.2 vs. 40.2%), comparable linalyl acetate content (40.6 vs. 44%), while the proportion of lavandulyl acetate was significantly higher (23.2 vs. 5.5%). To determine the influence of lavender oil on the production of proinflammatory cytokines and proregenerative growth factors, gene expression of the selected signaling molecules by HaCaT cells was investigated using real-time PCR. Results showed a concentration-dependent effect of lavender oils on the production of IL-6, IL-8, and VEGF by the keratinocyte cell line. Finally, the potential of the lavender oil to increase the production of VEGF, the most important angiogenic factor, with the in-house preparation performing significantly better in the in vitro cell models was identified.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Artemisia abrotanum&lt;/i&gt; L. (southern wormwood) is a plant species with an important position in the history of European and Asian medicine. It is a species famous as a medicinal plant in Central Asia, Asia Minor, and in South-East and Central Europe. The raw materials obtained from this species are &lt;i&gt;Abrotani herba&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Abrotani folium&lt;/i&gt;. In the traditional European medicine, they have been used successfully most of all in liver and biliary tract diseases, in parasitic diseases in children and as antipyretic medication. In the official European medicine, this plant species is recommended by the French Pharmacopoeia for use in homeopathy. In many European countries, it is used traditionally in allopathy. The latest studies on the biological activity of extracts from the aboveground parts of the plant and/or the leaves, and/or the essential oil have provided evidence of other possible applications related to their antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant, anticancer, and antiallergic properties. The latest studies have also focused on the repellent activity of the essential oil of this species and the possibility to use it in the prevention of diseases in which insects are the vectors. The main substances obtained from the plant that are responsible for this activity are: the essential oil, coumarins, phenolic acids, and flavonoids. Some of the latest investigations emphasize the large differences in the composition of the essential oil, determined by the geographical (climatic) origin of the plant. &lt;i&gt;A. abrotanum&lt;/i&gt; is recommended by the European Cosmetic Ingredients Database (CosIng) as a source of valuable cosmetic ingredients. Additionally, the leaves of this species possess a well-established position in the food industry. This plant species is also the object of biotechnological studies.">

Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 0.5 and 0.25 mg/mL were demonstrated against &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; in EC-G and EC-I, respectively, whereas MICs of 1 and 0.5 mg/mL were demonstrated against &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; in EC-G and EC-I, respectively. The treatment with control had the highest kill-time potential, whereas the treatment with oils had shorter kill-time. EC-I was observed to be more potent in the castor oil-induced diarrhea model than EC-G. At 100 and 200 mg/kg, P.O., EC-I exhibited 40% and 80% protection, respectively, and EC-G exhibited 20% and 60% protection, respectively, in mice, whereas loperamide (10 mg/kg, i.p., positive control) exhibited 100% protection.

Currently, viable therapeutic options that are cost effective, safe and readily available are desired, but lacking. Nevertheless, the pandemic is noticeably of lesser burden in African and Asian regions, where the use of traditional herbs predominates, with such relationship warranting a closer look at ethnomedicine. From a molecular viewpoint, the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the crucial first phase of COVID-19 pathogenesis. Here, we review plants with medicinal properties which may be implicated in mitigation of viral invasion either via direct or indirect modulation of ACE2 activity to ameliorate COVID-19. Selected ethnomedicinal plants containing bioactive compounds which may prevent and mitigate the fusion and entry of the SARS-CoV-2 by modulating ACE2-associated up and downstream events are highlighted. Through further experimentation, these plants could be supported for ethnobotanical use and the phytomedicinal ligands could be potentially developed into single or combined preventive therapeutics for COVID-19. This will benefit researchers actively looking for solutions from plant bioresources and help lessen the burden of COVID-19 across the globe.">

Of the 22 extracts, 9 and 4 extracts showed anti-&lt;i&gt;Acanthamoeba&lt;/i&gt; activity against trophozoites and cysts of &lt;i&gt;A. triangularis&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentration of &lt;i&gt;A. muricata&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C. trifoliatum&lt;/i&gt; extracts against trophozoites and cysts was 500 and 1,000 μg/mL, respectively.

        <span class="abst" title="SARS-CoV-2 infection across the world has led to immense turbulence in the treatment modality, thus demanding a swift drug discovery process. Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptor of human to initiate host invasion. Plethora of studies demonstrate the inhibition of Spike-ACE2 interactions to impair infection. The ancient Indian traditional medicine has been of great interest of Virologists worldwide to decipher potential antivirals. Hence, in this study, phytochemicals (1,952 compounds) from eight potential medicinal plants used in Indian traditional medicine were meticulously collated, based on their usage in respiratory disorders, along with immunomodulatory and anti-viral potential from contemporary literature. Further, these compounds were virtually screened against Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of Spike protein. The potential compounds from each plant were prioritized based on the binding affinity, key hotspot interactions at ACE2 binding region and glycosylation sites. Finally, the potential hits in complex with spike protein were subjected to Molecular Dynamics simulation (450 ns), to infer the stability of complex formation. Among the compounds screened, Tellimagrandin-II (binding energy of -8.2 kcal/mol and binding free energy of -32.08 kcal/mol) from &lt;i&gt;Syzygium aromaticum&lt;/i&gt; L. and O-Demethyl-demethoxy-curcumin (binding energy of -8.0 kcal/mol and binding free energy of -12.48 kcal/mol) from &lt;i&gt;Curcuma longa&lt;/i&gt; L. were found to be highly potential due to their higher binding affinity and significant binding free energy (MM-PBSA), along with favorable ADMET properties and stable intermolecular interactions with hotspots (including the ASN343 glycosylation site). The proposed hits are highly promising, as these are resultant of stringent &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; checkpoints, traditionally used, and are documented through contemporary literature. Hence, could serve as promising leads for subsequent experimental validations.">

        <span class="abst" title="The genus &lt;i&gt;Eriosema&lt;/i&gt; (Fabaceae) includes approximately 150 species widely distributed across tropical and subtropical regions of the world (Africa, Neotropics, Asia and Australia). Throughout these regions, several species are used since centuries in different traditional medicinal systems, while others are used as food or food supplement. The present review attempts to critically summarize current information concerning the uses, phytochemistry and pharmacology of the &lt;i&gt;Eriosema&lt;/i&gt; genus and to evaluate the therapeutic potential. The information published in English and French (up to September 2020) on ethnopharmacology or traditional uses, chemistry, pharmacology and toxicology of &lt;i&gt;Eriosema&lt;/i&gt; genus was collected from electronic databases [SciFinder, PubMed, Google, Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, Prelude Medicinal Plants-http://www.ethnopharmacologia.org/recherche-dans-prelude/?plant, The Plant List (http://www.theplantlist.org/), POWO (http://powo.science.kew.org/) and IUCN Red List Categories (https://www.iucnredlist.org/)], conference proceedings, books, M.Sc. and Ph.D. dissertations. The information retrieved on the ethnomedicinal indications of &lt;i&gt;Eriosema&lt;/i&gt; genus allowed to list 25 species (∼16.6% of the genus). The majority of uses is recorded from Africa. Phytochemical analyses of 8 species led to the identification and/or isolation of 107 compounds, with flavonoids (69.2%), chromones (7.5%) and benzoic acid derivatives (3.7%) as the main chemical classes. Pharmacological investigations with crude extracts and isolated compounds showed a broad range of activities including aphrodisiac, estrogenic, anti-osteoporosis, hypolipidemic, anti-diabetic, anti-diarrheal, anti-microbial, anti-oxidant, anthelmintic, anti-cancer, and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities. Despite the low number of &lt;i&gt;Eriosema&lt;/i&gt; species tested, there is convincing evidence in &lt;i&gt;vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies validating some traditional and ethnobotanical uses. However, the utility of several of the described uses has not yet been confirmed in pharmacological studies. Reviewed data could serve as a reference tool and preliminary information for advanced research on &lt;i&gt;Eriosema&lt;/i&gt; species.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;The essential oils possess both antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects, therefore they can provide an effective treatment against infections. Essential oils are widely used as supportive ingredients in many diseases, especially in the acute and chronic diseases of the respiratory tract. Neuroinflammation is responsible for several diseases of the central nervous system. Some plant-derived bioactive molecules have been shown to have role in attenuating neuroinflammation by regulating microglia, the immune cells of the CNS.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;In this study, the anti-inflammatory effect of three chemotypes of thyme essential oil and their main compounds (geraniol, thujanol and linalool) were examined on lipopolysaccharide-induced BV-2 microglia. Three different experimental setups were used, LPS pretreatment, essential oil pretreatment and co-treatments of LPS and essential oils in order to determine whether essential oils are able to prevent inflammation and can decrease it. The concentrations of the secreted tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) proinflammatory cytokines were measured and we analysed by Western blot the activity of the cell signalling pathways, NF-κB and CCAAT-enhancer binding protein β (C/EBPβ) regulating TNFα and IL-6 proinflammatory cytokine expressions in BV-2 cells.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Our results showed definite alterations in the effects of essential oil chemotypes and their main compounds at the different experimental setups. Considering the changes of IL-6 and TNFα secretions the best reduction of inflammatory cytokines could be reached by the pretreatment with the essential oils. In addition, the main compounds exerted better effects than essential oil chemotypes in case of LPS pretreatment. At the essential oil pretreatment experiment, the effect of linalool and geraniol was outstanding but there was no major difference between the actions of chemotypes and standards. Main compounds could be seen to have large inhibitory effects on certain cell signalling components related to the activation of the expression of proinflammatory cytokines.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Thyme essential oils are good candidates to use in prevention of neuroinflammation and related neurodegeneration, but the exact ratio of the components has to be selected carefully.">

Leaves of custard apple plants have been studied for their health benefits, which are attributed to a considerable diversity of phytochemicals. These compounds include phenol-based compounds, e.g., proanthocyanidins, comprising 18 different phenolic compounds, mainly alkaloids and flavonoids. Extracts from &lt;i&gt;Annona squamosa&lt;/i&gt; leaves (ASLs) have been studied for their biological activities, including anticancer, antidiabetic, antioxidant, antimicrobial, antiobesity, lipid-lowering, and hepatoprotective functions. In the current article, we discussed the nutritional and phytochemical diversity of ASLs. Additionally, ASL extracts were discussed with respect to their biological activities, which were established by in vivo and in vitro experiments. A survey of the literature based on the phytochemical profile and health-promoting effects of ASLs showed that they can be used as potential ingredients for the development of pharmaceutical drugs and functional foods. Although there are sufficient findings available from in vitro and in vivo investigations, clinical trials are still needed to determine the exact effects of ASL extracts on human health.">

        <span class="abst" title="Synucleinopathies are a group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the accumulation of α-synuclein aggregates in neurons, nerve fibers or glial cells. Three main types of diseases belong to the synucleinopathies: Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy. All of them develop as a result of an interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Emerging evidence suggests that epigenetic mechanisms play an essential role in the development of synucleinopathies. Since there is no disease-modifying treatment for these disorders at this time, interest is growing in plant-derived chemicals as a potential treatment option. Phytochemicals are substances of plant origin that possess biological activity, which might have effects on human health. Phytochemicals with neuroprotective activity target different elements in pathogenic pathways due to their antioxidants, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic properties, and ability to reduce cellular stress. Multiple recent studies demonstrate that the beneficial effects of phytochemicals may be explained by their ability to modulate the expression of genes implicated in synucleinopathies and other diseases. These substances may regulate transcription directly via transcription factors (TFs) or play the role of epigenetic regulators through their effect on histone modification, DNA methylation, and RNA-based mechanisms. Here, we summarize new data about the impact of phytochemicals on the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies through regulation of gene expression.">

The objective of this review was to document the scientific evidence about Mexican medicinal plants and their derivatives used for inflammatory and neuropathic pain treatment, as well as the mechanisms of action implicated in their antinociceptive effects, their possible adverse effects, and the main pharmacological aspects of each plant or compound. Our data review suggested that most studies on Mexican medicinal plants have used inflammatory experimental models for testing. The anti-pain properties exerted by medicinal plants lack adverse effects, and their toxicological assays report that they are safe to consume; therefore, more studies should be performed on preclinical neuropathic pain models. Moreover, there is no convincing evidence about the possible mechanisms of action involved in the anti-pain properties exerted by Mexican plants. Therefore, the isolation and pharmacological characterization of these plant derivatives' compounds will be important in the design of future preclinical studies.">

        <span class="abst" title="Three pathogenic fungi of blueberry (&lt;i&gt;Vaccinium&lt;/i&gt; spp.) responsible for dieback disease, identified as &lt;i&gt;Pestalotiopsis clavispora&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Colletotrichum gloeosporioides&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae&lt;/i&gt;, were isolated in the northwestern region of the state of Michoacán, Mexico. The mycelial growth in vitro of these fungi was inhibited by extracts from &lt;i&gt;Lantana hirta&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Argemone ochroleuca&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Adenophyllum porophyllum&lt;/i&gt;, medicinal plants collected in Sahuayo, Michoacán, Mexico. The extracts showed different degrees of inhibition; the most effective were: M5L extract from &lt;i&gt;L. hirta&lt;/i&gt; and M6LFr extract from &lt;i&gt;A. ochroleuca&lt;/i&gt;, both of which inhibited 100% of the mycelial growth of &lt;i&gt;P. clavispora&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C. gloeosporioides&lt;/i&gt;; and M4LS extract from &lt;i&gt;A. porophyllum&lt;/i&gt;, which inhibited 100% of the mycelial growth of the three pathogens. The extracts were fractionated by thin layer and column chromatography, and the most active fractions were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The major compounds identified in &lt;i&gt;L. hirta&lt;/i&gt; extract were Phytol and α-Sitosterol. The compounds identified in &lt;i&gt;A. ochroleuca&lt;/i&gt; were Toluene and Benzene, 1,3-bis(3-phenoxyphenoxy)-. In &lt;i&gt;A. porophyllum&lt;/i&gt;, the compound identified was Hexanedioic acid, bis(2-ethylhexyl) ester. These results show the potential of &lt;i&gt;L. hirta&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;A. ochroleuca&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A. porophyllum&lt;/i&gt; as a source of antifungal compounds.">

        <span class="abst" title="Agricultural landscapes are increasingly characterized by intensification and habitat losses. Landscape composition and configuration are known to mediate insect abundance and richness. In the context of global insect decline, and despite 75% of crops being dependent on insects, there is still a gap of knowledge about the link between pollinators and aromatic crops. Fennel (&lt;i&gt;Foeniculum vulgare&lt;/i&gt;) is an aromatic plant cultivated in the South of France for its essential oil, which is of great economic interest. Using pan-traps, we investigated the influence of the surrounding habitats at landscape scale (semi-natural habitat proportion and vicinity, landscape configuration) and local scale agricultural practices (insecticides and patch size) on fennel-flower-visitor abundance and richness, and their subsequent impact on fennel essential oil yield. We found that fennel may to be a generalist plant species. We did not find any effect of intense local management practices on insect abundance and richness. Landscape configuration and proximity to semi-natural habitat were the main drivers of flying insect family richness. This richness positively influenced fennel essential oil yield. Maintaining a complex configuration of patches at the landscape scale is important to sustain insect diversity and crop yield.">

Thus, we present the natural polymers and the synthetic macromolecular chains that are commonly used as networks for embedding EOs, owing to their biodegradability and biocompatibility, interdependent encapsulation methods, and potential applicability of bioactive blend structures. The possibilities of using artificial intelligence to evaluate the bioactivity of EOs-in direct correlation with their chemical constitutions and structures, in order to avoid complex laboratory analyses, to save money and time, and to enhance the final consistency of the products-are also presented.">
