	<entry name="abacavir drug pathway" description="The pathway of abacavir-target interaction and of the biochemical or physiological responses to them. Abacavir is a drug used for the treatment of HIV infection. Abacavir inhibits HIV-1 reverse transcriptase activity by competing with the natural substrate dGTP and by its incorporation into viral DNA whose growth is then terminated. Genetic variations can cause differences in the response of the organism to the drug. A small percentage of individuals receiving the drug develop immune-mediated hypersensitivity reactions (HSR), those carrying a variant in the human leukocyte antigen B (HLA-B) gene.">
