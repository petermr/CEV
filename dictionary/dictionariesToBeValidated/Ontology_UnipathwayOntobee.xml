	<entry term="(R)-mevalonate metabolism" description="Biosynthesis of mevalonic acid, a six-carbon metabolic intermediate. In eukaryotes, it arises from linkage of two acetyl-CoAs in the mitochondrion to form acetaoacetyl-CoA (4 carbons), followed by addition of another acetyl group from a third acetyl-CoA to give 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA). This latter compound is reduced by HMG-CoA reductase in the endoplasmic reticulum, using two NADPHs, with coincident loss of CoASH. HMG-CoA reductase is the most important regulatory enzyme for the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway and other isoprenoids/terpenoids. HMG-CoA reductase is a target for drugs that attempt to lower cholesterol levels in the body. One such drug is lovastatin, which inhibits the enzyme and stops endogenous synthesis of cholesterol.">

There are two alternative pathways of methionine synthesis in microorganisms. The enterobacterial type trans-sulfuration pathway involves cystathionine as an intermediate and utilizes cysteine as the sulfur source. In contrast, the direct sulfhydrylation pathway found in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), spirochete (Leptospira meyeri) and actinomycetes (Corynebacterium glutamicum) bypasses cystathionine and uses inorganic sulfur instead. Although yeast, fungi and higher plants have both transsulfuration and direct sulfhydrylation pathways, only the bacteria C. glutamicum, B. subtilis, P. aeruginosa, P. putida and L. meyeri have been shown to have both pathways. Methionine biosynthesis is a central pathway, as it controls a large number of cellular processes such as translation of mRNA into proteins (not only as a substrate for protein elongation but also as the initiator of protein synthesis) and transmethylation reactions via the formation of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) (cf activated methyl cycle pathway).">

The methyl group of the methionine unit is activated by the positive charge on the adjacent sulfur atom, which makes the molecule much more reactive than N5-methyltetrahydrofolate. The synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine is unusual in that the triphosphate group of ATP is split into pyrophosphate and orthophosphate; the pyrophosphate is subsequently hydrolyzed to two molecules of Pi. S-Adenosylhomocysteine is formed when the methyl group of S-adenosylmethionine is transferred to an acceptor. S-Adenosylhomocysteine is then hydrolyzed to homocysteine and adenosine. Methionine can be regenerated by the transfer of a methyl group to homocysteine. [Stryer, Biochemistry, 2002].">

Assembly takes place on the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane, involving separate transport of heme and the apocytochrome across the membrane [PMID:2172694]; the latter occurs via the general protein secretory (Sec) pathway of the cell [PMID:9219541]. Following translocation, assembly proceeds via a pathway involving a number of specific proteins. Two distinct systems have been identified in bacteria. System I is found in alpha - and gamma -proteobacteria, including E. coli, R. capsulatus, B. japonicum, and P. denitrificans. System II seems more widespread than system I, occurring in a range of bacteria including cyanobacteria, Gram-positive bacteria such as Mycobacterium species, beta -, gamma -, and delta -proteobacteria such as B. pertussis, T. ferrooxidans, and H. pylori, respectively, and some extremophiles such as A. aeoliticus. Common to both systems is that the apocytochrome cysteine thiols and the heme iron must be in their reduced states for thioether bond formation to occur. Thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases are required for this, and specific proteins have been identified in a number of system I organisms, including E. coli (CcmG), R. capsulatus (HelX), B. japonicum (CycY), and P. denitrificans (CcmG), and one system II organism, B. pertussis (CcsX) [PMID:12637552]. .">

	<entry term="small protein conjugation" description="Ubiquitin is a small protein that occurs in all eukaryotic cells. Its main known function is to mark other proteins for destruction, known as proteolysis. The process of marking a protein with ubiquitin (ubiquitinylation, ubiquitylation or ubiquitination) consists of a series of steps [source: wikipedia]: 1. Activation of ubiquitin - ubiquitin is activated in a two-step reaction by an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme in a process requiring ATP as an energy source. The initial step involves production of a ubiquitin-adenylate intermediate. The second step transfers ubiquitin to the E1 active site cysteine residue, with release of AMP. This step results in a thioester linkage between the C-terminal carboxyl group of ubiquitin and the E1 cysteine sulfhydryl group. 2. Transfer of ubiquitin from E1 to the active site cysteine of a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 via a trans(thio)esterification reaction. 3. The final step of the ubiquitinylation cascade generally requires the activity of one of the hundreds of E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases (often termed simply ubiquitin ligase). E3 enzymes function as the substrate recognition modules of the system and are capable of interaction with both E2 and substrate. E3 enzymes possess one of two domains: * The HECT (Homologous to the E6-AP Carboxyl Terminus) domain * The RING domain (or the closely related U-box domain).">

Folic acid is an essential vitamin (B9), which plays a key role in the methylation cycle and in DNA biosynthesis. The folic acid derivatives are made up of a pterdine ring attached to a p-aminobenzoate and a polyglutamyl chain. Tetrahydrofolic acid have C1 units enzymically attached. These C1 units (as a formyl group) are passed on to enzymes in the purine pathway that insert the C-2 and C-8 into the purine ring. A methylene group (-CH2-) attached to tetrahydrofolate is used to convert the uracil-type pyrimidine base found in RNA into the thymine base found in DNA. A further folate cofactor, i.e. 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, is involved in the remethylation of the homocysteine produced in the methylation cycle back to methionine. After activation to S-adenosylmethionine this acts as a methyl donor for the dozens of different methyltransferases present in all cells. Folate deficiency results in reduction of purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis and consequently DNA biosynthesis and cell division. Folate deficiency receives increasing attention due to its relation to cardiovascular disease and different forms of dementia.
