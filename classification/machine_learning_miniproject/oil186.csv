In general, the roots contain the highest level of elements followed by stems, leaves, flowers, buds and fruits of the different maturity stages. Nevertheless, uptake of elements by a plant is influenced by various factors, including the type of plant, nature of the soil, climate and agricultural practices [  36 ]. In the current study, the different elemental concentrations were varied due to the above factors.   A. sowa  L. root accumulated a significant amount of minerals in Bangladeshi geo-environmental condition. The results are also compared with the reported [  8 ] data of   Anethum graveolens  L. root where K (38,500 ppm) had the highest value, Ca (12,200 ppm) and Mg (6700 ppm) had the lowest values than our current study. The elements, especially Ca, Mg, K, Na, Fe and Al play a significant role in human metabolism and the life processes. The rich amount of Ca is important because of its role in bones, teeth, muscle system and heart functions [  37 ]. Mg has been particularly shown to play a significant role as a regulatory cation in direct and indirect traumatic brain injury [  38 ]. Another report on Mg, it also helps in preventing some heart disorders and high blood pressure [  39 ]. Recently, it has been reported that trace amounts of Rb and Cs help in the breakdown of starch to glucose [  36 ]. Cs was present in the trace amount (21.53 ppb) in the present study. Se has anti-oxidising function and it is essential for providing the organism with triiodothyroxine produced from thyroxine [  40 ]. It contributes to the maintenance of cellular antioxidative balance when taken up at the recommended dietary allowance of 50–100 μg/day and tolerable upper intake limit is 400 μg/day [  41 ]. The high dosage of selenate has been shown to normalize hyperglycemia [  36 ]. Li is another element with beneficial pharmacological properties which effectively used in the treatment of manic depressive disorders [  42 ]. The result also showed that many of these elements have vital importance in human metabolism for growth, developments and also prevention and healing of diseases. The non-essential or toxic elemental contents in spice and medicinal plants are attracting attention to the scientist and also the food chemist due to its adverse effect on the human body in respect of medicinal and food preparation. The permissible limits of Hg and As are 1 and 10 mg/kg in foodstuff respectively [  43 ]. The maximum prescribed limit of Cd is 0.3 mg/kg for herbal medicines and its product while the dietary intake limit is 10.3 mg/kg as per who recommendation [  44 ]. Moreover, the toxic elements were found below the prescribed limits in the present experiment. Nonetheless, excessive intake can cause poisoning in the human body. Hg poisoning can result in damage to the brain, kidney, lungs including acrodynia (pink disease), Hunter-Russell syndrome and Minamata disease [  45 ]. The acute sign of As poisoning includes fever, anorexia, hepatomegaly, cardiac arrhythmia, transient encephalopathy and irritation of the gastrointestinal tract [  46 ]. Cd intoxication can lead to kidney, bone and pulmonary damages [  47 ]. Pb and Cd cause both acute and chronic poisoning, adverse effects on the kidney, liver, heart, vascular and immune system [  48 ]. Furthermore, root parts of   Anethum sowa  L. herb is not usually consumed, it is wasted mostly. The present investigation will be helpful for Ayurvedic and pharmaceutical industries to assess the essential and toxic elemental level for medicinal preparation.",['for providing'],1,['Se has anti-oxidising function and it is essential for providing the organism with triiodothyroxine produced from thyroxine [  40 ].'],[[]],[[]],[[]],[[]],[['for providing']]

Sucrose was the main sugar in   Bouskri  unlike other varieties which contain fructose and glucose in high amount.   Bouskri  contains the highest amount of pyridoxine and   Majhoul  possesses the highest amount niacin and riboflavin. Among analyzed cultivars,   Bousthammi  contains the highest amount of magnesium and manganese and has iron seven times more than   Jihl  cultivars, which contains a high amount of calcium and copper. The highest amount of zinc was found in   Najda  while the highest amount of potassium was detected in   Bouskri . Significant difference in antioxidant activity was observed between analyzed varieties. The highest antioxidant activity was observed in both   Bousrdoun  and   Jihl  which contained the highest amount of phenolic and flavonoids content. Gallic, Ferulic, Caffeic acids and Rutin were the most dominant among analysed polyphenolic compounds and the highest amount of these compounds were observed in   Jihl  and   Bousrdoun.  Regarding the anti-inflammatory activity and based on the results of three in vitro assays and two in vivo assays,   Bousrdoun  and   Jihl  exhibited the highest anti-inflammatory effect. Moderate antibacterial activity was observed in all studied varieties except Bouskri and Majhoul which didn’t show no antibacterial effect against the six bacterial strains.   Bousrdon  and   Jihl  were found to be more potent against these bacterial strains. These differences in chemical composition and biological activity suggest that date fruit is an extensive domain hence the size should not be the only character that should be used to choose the variety but also its composition and their biological activities.

This enhances the lipid peroxidation associated with aging and increases the formation of certain oxidized cholesterol derivatives, called oxysterols, especially those formed by auto-oxidation such as 7-ketocholesterol (7KC). This lipid peroxidation is also accompanied by a degradation of the unsaturated fatty acids which generate highly reactive aldehydes which can lead to the formation of carbonylated proteins whose activities are modified compared to those of the native proteins from which they are derived. This results in perturbations of cell signaling leading to several cellular dysfunctions. Furthermore, the ability of molecules derived from lipid peroxidation to stimulate oxidative stress and/or inflammation, alter cell metabolism and induce changes in DNA may result in cell death. 7KC is the oxysterol preferentially formed by auto-oxidation of cholesterol. Since 7KC is weakly metabolized (at the exception of its degradation in bile acids by liver cells), it accumulates progressively, mainly in brain cells, and may induce cytotoxic effects: oxidative stress, inflammation and cell death. Its contribution to age-related diseases is therefore widely suspected. In order to prevent the cytotoxic effects of 7KC on the nerve cells of the central nervous system, one of the possibilities is to identify cytoprotective agents in order to reduce or inhibit its harmful activities. The cytoprotective agents may be either natural or synthetic molecules or mixtures of molecules such as oils. In this context, the cytoprotective properties of argan oils (Agadir, Berkane) and some of their major compounds (especially α-tocopherol) have been studied. To this end, complementary techniques of microscopy, flow cytometry and biochemistry were used. The composition of Argan oils has also been determined by different chromatography techniques. Argan oils have highly antioxidant properties even in vivo when given per os in the rat. On 158N murine oligodendrocytes, these oils are capable of attenuating the cytotoxicity of 7KC: loss of cellular adhesion, alteration of the plasma membrane, mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunctions, overproduction of oxygen radicals, induction of apoptosis and autophagy. Overall, our findings provide several in vitro and in vivo proofs of concept that suggest that Argan oils could prevent and mitigate severe age related pathologies especially neurodegenerative diseases.",['contribution'],1,['Its contribution to age-related diseases is therefore widely suspected.'],[[]],[[]],[[]],[[]],[['contribution']]

The DPPH test aims at measuring the capacity of the essential oil to scavenge the stable free radical DPPH  .  by donation of hydrogen atom or an electron [  23 ]. If the extracts have the capacity to scavenge the DPPH free radical, the initial blue/purple solution will change to a yellow colour due to the formation of diphenylpicrylhydrazine. The effect of the different   Cl EO on DPPH radical scavenging was compared to those of ascorbic acid, used as positive control, and appreciated by the determination of the IC  50  values. As shown in Fig.   1 , DPPH test revealed that the free radical-scavenging activity was a dose dependent manner. From the analysis of Fig.   1 , we can conclude that the radical-scavenging activity of the   Cl EO and positive controls ascorbic acid increased with increasing concentration (  P  <0.05).

However, EOCL higher doses (100 and 200 mg/kg, i.p.) prevented episodes of convulsions and offered 100% protections comparable to diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.). This result indicates that this oil demonstrated significant anticonvulsant effect and may be effective in the management of generalized convulsion such as tonic-clonic and myoclonic convulsions as suggested in other studies   [41] . The mechanism of action of the anticonvulsant effect of the oil was not evaluated but enhancement or augmentation of GABA  A  neurotransmission in CNS may be involved   [42] . Strychnine-induced convulsions are closely linked with glycine inhibition in the spinal cord and the brain stem. The ability to reduce percentage mortality after seizures is suggestive of some potential usefulness of a drug against neurotoxicity which normally causes death following extensive seizures. However, the oil at all the tested doses failed to protect the mice against the strychnine-induced convulsions indicating that the oil or its constituent(s) may not have significant facilitatory effect on the glycine neural circuit   [43] .

Taking into account these properties, some essential oils may be considered for applications to different food systems such as meat, dairy, oils, and dressing. Many previous studies focussed on technological rather than nutritional aspects, and most studies on the biological activities of EOs were carried out in vitro, but not in vivo. Therefore, more studies in human systems are necessary to understand the effects of EOs on human health and their potential contribution to the nutrient and safety characteristics of food systems. It is critical to understand the effect of EOs and to optimize their combinations for use in food preservation to better exploit their possible synergistic effects in preventing both lipid oxidation and spoilage by pathogenic organisms. These considerations warrant the search for new medicinal plant species with high phenolic compound contents for beneficial applications in the food industry.",['contribution'],1,"['Therefore, more studies in human systems are necessary to understand the effects of EOs on human health and their potential contribution to the nutrient and safety characteristics of food systems.']",[[]],[[]],[[]],[[]],[['contribution']]

Thus, experiments with labelled products and/or treatments with specific inhibitors (mevinoline and fosmidomycin that respectively block the MVA and MEP pathways) illustrate that the compartmental division between the two pathways is not complete since common metabolites from both pathways can be exchanged, in both directions, through the plastidial membrane [  11 ,  19 ,  20 ].

Until now, three genes involved in the first steps of the synthesis of terpenes have been overexpressed in spike lavender, the   Arabidopsis  HMG1, DXS and DXR genes, encoding the respective HMGR1S, DXS and DXR enzymes. As expected, the overexpression of the DXS gene produced a significant increase of the end-product monoterpenes derived from an elevated supply of precursors of the MEP isoprenoid pathway without affecting the chlorophyll and carotenoid content [  34 ]. Surprisingly, the overexpression of the DXR enzyme did not lead to an increase of monoterpenes or photosynthetic pigments [  35 ]. In contrast, the overexpression of the HMG1 gene from   Arabidopsis , led to an increased yield of essential oil since transgenic T0 plants accumulated significantly more essential oil constituents as compared to controls (up to 2.1- and 1.8-fold in leaves and flowers, respectively). These transgenic plants also increased its amount of the end-product sterols, β-sitosterol and stigmasterol (average differences of 1.8- and 1.9-fold, respectively), but did not accumulate more carotenoids or chlorophylls as compared to controls. The potential of the mevalonate pathway for enhanced isoprenoid production by upregulation of HMGR and other enzymes of the pathway as well as its interaction with the MEP pathway have been updated recently [  36 ]. The increased levels of essential oil and sterols observed in the transgenic T0 plants were maintained in the progeny that inherited the HMG1 transgene. Therefore, genetic manipulation of the MVA pathway also increases essential oil yield in spike lavender, suggesting a contribution for this cytosolic pathway to monoterpene and sesquiterpene biosynthesis in leaves and flowers of the species [  37 ].

The labelling period (pulse) is followed by a chase period in which the plants grow under normal conditions and natural   13 CO  2  abundance for several hours/days. During that time, unlabeled products and intermediates are produced, that also are used in the production of the final metabolites. Therefore, complex patterns of [  12 C]- and [  13 C]-isotopologues are expected to be found in the final natural products. The analysis of complex isotopologue mixtures in   13 CO  2 -labelled natural products became possible recently, because of the remarkable improvement made in NMR and mass spectrometry techniques [  40 ,  42 ,  43 ,  44 ,  45 ,  46 ].   13 CO  2  feeding has also been used to measure plastidic DMAPP concentrations and to quantify the   de novo  production of volatile and nonvolatile isoprenoids in some species [  47 ].

Nevertheless, essential oil yield was always higher in those transgenic spike lavender plants overexpressing the DXS gene. Previous work using specific inhibitors of both pathways and feeding experiments with [U-  13 C6]-glucose, suggested a minor contribution of the MVA pathway that was increased in transgenic (HMGR5) spike lavender plants [  37 ]. Results presented here using labelled   13 CO  2  confirmed that in WT and transgenic HMGR spike lavender plants, the biosynthesis of camphor and cineole happen in a very robust way through the MEP pathway according to the results achieved with NMR and GC/MS. Still, outcomes with HMGR overexpressing spike lavender plants cast doubt about the fact that the MVA pathway might be involved, even in a small share, on the production of monoterpenes because of the higher content of essential oil in those plants. It is well known that the MVA and MEP pathways are not totally independent as there is some crosstalk between them through common intermediates [  11 ,  39 ,  53 ]. Experiments with labelled intermediates [2-  13 C  1 ]mevalonolactone or [U-  13 C  6 ]glucose in   Catharanthus roseus  using NMR techniques showed that crosstalk between the MVA and MEP pathways cannot be explained in detail by a simple two compartment model and requires an additional in depth study of complex regulatory mechanisms [  19 ].

Overall, according to the three tests used in this study (ABTS radical scavenging activity, Reducing power and Phosphomolybdenum assay), the obtained antioxidant activity of the RaEO might be attributed to the presence of high percentages of mainly germacrene D (49.2 ± 1.1%), methyl eugenol (8.3 ± 0.28%), (E)-β-ionone (6.2 ± 0.18%) and β-caryophyllene (5.7 ± 0.17%) (Table   1 ).

By generating a fingerprint for pattern comparison and then complementing the data with a clone library, resolving peaks using a database, and performing multivariate analysis, TRFLP can reveal the differences in unknown microbial communities in various environmental samples (Liu et al.,   1997 ). T-RFLP was applied to investigate the composition and succession of bacterial communities after the oil spill and successfully revealed the relatively higher contribution of the bacterial group   Flavobacteria , which is a secondary consumer of methane, oil, or cellular decay products (Redmond and Valentine,   2011 ). Profiles generated by TRFLP indicated that up to 56% of the total bacteria in plume samples collected in September 2010 were affiliated with   Flavobacteria , whereas this number was only 10–30% when 16S rRNA gene-based clone library techniques were applied (Redmond and Valentine,   2011 ). In a recent study, the TRFLP analysis for community composition of ammonia oxidizers in salt marshes after the DWH oil spill revealed that exposure to oil, even 2 years post-spill, could contribute to subtle changes in population dynamics of bacterial communities (Bernhard et al.,   2016 ). Although T-RFLP could provide more authentic data compared to clone libraries, it could still underestimate community diversity, especially when complex and large amounts of data were applied. In the abovementioned study (Redmond and Valentine,   2011 ), some terminal restriction fragments could be assigned to multiple groups. Due to the significant overlaps between the   methanotrophs, methylotrophs , and some other γ-  proteobacteria , it was not possible to distinguish the δ-  proteobacteria, Actinobacteria , and SAR406 clades from each other. Nevertheless, some groups, such as   Flavobacteria , α-  proteobacteria , and γ-  proteobacteria  could be readily differentiated.",['contribution'],1,"['T-RFLP was applied to investigate the composition and succession of bacterial communities after the oil spill and successfully revealed the relatively higher contribution of the bacterial group   Flavobacteria , which is a secondary consumer of methane, oil, or cellular decay products (Redmond and Valentine,   2011 ).']",[[Flavobacteria]],[['ORG']],[[196]],[[209]],[['contribution']]

Further, differences in bacterial community composition (beta diversity) between the exposure groups were assessed using Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) using the “adonis” function in the R package “Vegan” [  39 ]. The test was run with 20,000 permutations, applying both OTU-based (Bray-Curtis/Jaccard) and phylogeny-based (weighted and unweighted UniFrac) measures. PERMANOVA was also applied to test for differences in PAH metabolites between the exposure groups. PERMANOVA assumes the multivariate dispersion in the compared groups to be homogeneous; this was verified using the “betadisper” function in “Vegan”. Similarity percentage (SIMPER) procedure implemented in “Vegan” was used to quantify the contribution of individual OTUs to the overall Bray-Curtis dissimilarity between the groups. “MetaStats” [  40 ] was used to test for OTUs and orders with statistically significant differential abundances between the exposure groups. Only OTUs containing more than 0.1% of the total number of reads in the normalized and filtered dataset were used in this analysis. Finally, a correspondence analysis (CA) (“  cca ” in Vegan) was performed to explore the gut microbial community structure. Environmental parameters (order abundances) that significantly (  p  < 0.01) correlated with the ordination were fitted onto the CA plot using the “  envfit ” command in Vegan.",['contribution'],1,['Similarity percentage (SIMPER) procedure implemented in “Vegan” was used to quantify the contribution of individual OTUs to the overall Bray-Curtis dissimilarity between the groups.'],[[Bray-Curtis]],[['ORG']],[[136]],[[147]],[['contribution']]

The effect of the two essential oils on egg hatch was also examined. Ten and 12 compounds, respectively, were identified in garlic and asafoetida essential oils. Allyl disulfide (49.13%) and diallyl trisulfide (31.08%) were the most abundant compounds in garlic essential oil accounting for 80.2% of the total oil. In contrast, (E)-sec-butyl propenyl disulfide (30.03%), (Z)-sec-butyl propenyl disulfide (24.32%), and disulfide, methyl 1-(methylthio)propyl (21.87%) were the most abundant compounds in asafoetida essential oil. Allyl disulfide accounted for 7.38% of the total oil in asafoetida essential oil and was one of only three compounds found in both oils. For both mosquito species, garlic essential oil was more toxic than asafoetida essential oil with    Cx. restuans  (LC   50 : garlic = 2.7 ppm; asafoetida = 10.1 ppm) being more sensitive than    Cx. pipiens  (LC   50 : garlic = 7.5 ppm; asafoetida = 13.5 ppm). When combined, the two essential oils had antagonistic effects. The majority of    Culex  egg rafts exposed to garlic (73.1%) or asafoetida (55.8%) essential oils failed to hatch and larvae of the few that did hatch mostly died as first instars. Allyl disulfide exhibited strong ovicidal and larvicidal activity suggesting its important contribution to the overall toxicity of the two essential oils. Thus, garlic and asafoetida essential oils are potent mosquito ovicides and larvicides but if used jointly, they could undermine vector control programs.

The two compounds were the most abundant constituents in our garlic essential oil accounting for 80.2% (ally disulfide = 49.13%; diallyl trisulfide = 31.08%) of the total oil. These values are much higher than the 7.2% (allyl disulfide) and 16.3% (diallyl trisulfide) reported by   Kimbaris et al. (2009)  and may explain why our LC  50 s were much lower than those reported in their study. Allyl disulfide (7.38%) and diallyl trisulfide (4.55%) occurred as minor components in asafoetida essential oil, and were two of only three constituents that occurred in both essential oils. Thus, despite their low abundance, both compounds are likely among the minor components influencing the toxicity of asafoetida essential oil.

Such activity is suggestive of their potential as insect pest control agents, although their potency is lower than that of the oxadiazine indoxacarb. However, the essential oil activity may well be enhanced with the use of adjuvants and with oral exposure in addition to contact, as demonstrated in our feeding bioassays. The activity of   S .   guianensis  essential oil was also previously reported for other pest species including the wax moths   G .   mellonella  and   A .   grisella   26  , the mosquitoes   A .   aegypti  and   C .   quinquefasciatus   24   and the cattle tick   R .   microplus   25  .

The CC essential oil, which presented the highest cytotoxicity (CC  50  = 49.5 ± 20.5 μg.mL  -1 ), exhibited a moderate antiviral activity when introduced prior or during the viral absorption. In contrast, there was no evidence for an inhibitory effect from the VZ essential oil. The contribution of the major components of essential oils to their antiviral properties has been claimed in the case of HSV-1 [  43 –  45 ]. PG and CC essential oils are monoterpene-rich essential oils in contrast to the non-active VZ essential oil that is mainly constituted by sesquiterpenes.
