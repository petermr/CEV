Under the global warming scenario, land&#x02013;ocean temperature contrasts and low-level monsoon circulation progressively strengthen accompanied by enhanced precipitation over the Indian subcontinent. Notably, in the solar geoengineered scenario, marginal surface cooling is projected over the majority of the ISM region, and there is strengthening of both upper and lower level circulation. However, preferential precipitation near Western Ghats leads to dry bias over majority of Indian land. Upon the termination of the geoengineering, the climatic conditions&#x02014;temperature, precipitation, winds and moisture would abruptly change to what it would have been under the global warming scenario. Thus, this may be important to note that such changes may need attention for the future mitigation and adaptation purposes if solar geoengineering is required to implement in future.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Climate sciences</kwd><kwd>Applied physics</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2021</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Global warming is causing widespread effects throughout the globe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.

In the present study, we utilized the model outputs from GeoMIP experiment G2, in which, starting from a preindustrial baseline (piControl), the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration was increased by 1% per year (the corresponding simulation with only CO<sub>2</sub> increase and no geoengineering is referred to as 1pctCO2), while total solar irradiance was reduced commensurately to offset global mean temperature change. This was conducted for 50&#x000a0;years, and then geoengineering was abruptly terminated, and the model was run for an additional 20&#x000a0;years. This enables modeling groups to capture the changing climate effects due to gradual ramp-up of geoengineering, as well as the termination effect.

Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> compares the change in monsoon season spatial averages of temperature and precipitation over the globe, tropics (30N&#x02013;30S) and ISM region (15S&#x02013;45N, 40E&#x02013;120E) under the 1pctCO2 and G2 scenarios. The global and tropical region monsoon season spans June through August, whereas the monsoon season in the ISM region spans June through September. The shading depicts one standard deviation of inter-model spread. As popularly noted in past global warming studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, this analysis also shows a steady increase in global mean temperature (red line) with CO<sub>2</sub> concentration increase, reaching&#x02009;~&#x02009;1.9&#x000a0;K (model mean) after 70&#x000a0;years. Mean warming over tropical regions is lower than global mean warming, consistent with polar amplification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Over the ISM region, the warming over the 70-year simulation of 1pctCO2 is similar to that of the global mean warming. Under G2 (blue lines Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), global warming is compensated well by G2 with residual warming of 0.3&#x000a0;K for the global average, the tropics and the ISM land region. However, over ISM ocean there is no systematic change. The precipitation decreases globally and over the tropics up to0.9 and 1.1%, respectively. With sudden termination of geoengineering (vertical dotted line), global mean temperature is projected to increase rapidly, approaching the outcome of seven decades of continued warming, but in just two decades; these results are aligned with the findings of one of the previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The rate of temperature increase over the period after termination is approximately 1.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C in the first decade and 0.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C in the second. Similar to the temperature response, after abrupt termination of geoengineering, mean precipitation over the globe and tropics show a rapid rate of increase. However, the rates for domain average precipitation change over the ISM land and oceanic region in the geoengineered period and the period after termination are difficult to differentiate due to the large inter-annual variability.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Changes in surface air temperature (&#x000b0;C, left column) and precipitation (mm/day, right column) for 1pctCO2 (red line) and G2 (blue line) simulations relative to the piControl condition for the globe (top row, JJA mean), tropics (middle row, JJA mean), and Indian monsoon region (bottom row, JJAS mean).

Over years 11&#x02013;30, the 1pctCO2 scenario (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a) projects a statistically significant warming over ISM oceanic regions. However, over the land region, at least 70% models agreed on the sign of change that is positive but values are insignificant over central India and the majority of the sub-tropical land.

During years 51&#x02013;69 under 1pctCO2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c), warming gets intensified over both the land and the ocean.

Correspondingly, the land&#x02013;ocean temperature gradient gets intensified during this period.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Multi model mean surface air temperature change (<sup>0</sup>C) in the 1pctCO2 simulations (top row), G2 simulations (middle row) relative to piControl simulations for the Indian monsoon season (Jun-Sep) for three consecutive 20&#x000a0;year time periods.

However, the majority of the Himalayan range is projected to be significantly cooler than other parts of Indian sub-continent. With further sustention of geo-engineering (31&#x02013;50&#x000a0;years period, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e,h), more regions are projected to be significantly cooler than in the corresponding 1pctCO2 scenario. A greater degree of cooling is projected over the Himalayan range than other parts of the ISM region, which may reduce Himalayan glacier melt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Compared to the Indian land, projections over the subtropics are mixed and less conclusive. Similar to the Indian land, the areal extent of significantly cooler regions over ocean, increases with prolonged sustention of geoengineering. These different level of cooling over different regions may be attributed to the presence of inhomogeneous topographic surfaces. With abrupt termination of geoengineering (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f,i), temperature over the ISM region rises at a higher rate than in the 1pctCO2 scenario. The warming over the subtropics reaches the 70-year value of the 1pctCO2 simulation within just 20&#x000a0;years. Over the Indian land and oceanic regions, warming after abrupt termination of geoengineering is 0.5&#x02014;1&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C less than in the sub-tropical regions. This fast rate of warming of subtropical regions (consisting only of land regions) compared to tropical region (partly land and partly ocean) may be attributed to the faster rate of warming of land regions than oceanic regions. However, over tropical Indian land the fast rate of increase in temperature is partly compensated by the cooling effect caused due to increase in precipitation, so the rate of increase of temperature over Indian land is relatively slower than subtropical land.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Changes in atmospheric circulation</title><p id="Par9">Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> demonstrate the response of monsoon wind circulation to global warming, geoengineering and its termination.

Moisture convergence increases over the Arabian Peninsula, central, south-east India and eastern Arabian Sea.

This increase in moisture leads to increase in moisture convergence near Western Ghats. Once the convection is triggered, it leads to a locally enhanced tropospheric temperature gradient leading to a stronger Somali Jet. Since the moisture carried by the Somali Jet is not able to reach the Indian land due to preferential precipitation over the windward side of Western Ghats, a dry bias is noted over majority of the&#x000a0;Indian land. In the year 51&#x02013;69 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>f), strong moisture convergence is observed over majority of Somali Jet region, western Ghats and Bay of Bengal.

The stippling and hatch criterion is the same as for surface air temperature.

Whereas, a marginal, insignificant increase in precipitation is projected over the majority of the Indian land however, at least 70% of the models agree in the sign of change that is positive. Over the subsequent 20&#x000a0;years period (years 31&#x02013;50, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b), a statistically significant increase in precipitation is projected over parts of the northeast Himalayan range and the mountains of Myanmar. The region near the equatorial Indian Ocean is projected to have an increase in precipitation, coincident with weakening of the TEJ. Over the south equatorial Indian Ocean and the maritime continent, precipitation is projected to decrease within this second 20&#x000a0;years period.

The Bay of Bengal and north Indian Ocean are also projected to have significant increases in precipitation under the 1pctCO2 scenario. However, the regions to the south of equatorial Indian Ocean and the maritime continent are projected to have a significant decrease in precipitation in both 1pctCO2 and G2 scenarios.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>As in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> but for precipitation (mm/day).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2021_89249_Fig6_HTML" id="MO6"/></fig></p><p id="Par17">Under the G2 scenario, the majority of Indian land shows an insignificant decline in precipitation relative to piControl (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>d-e).

With abrupt termination of geoengineering (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>f), the rebound of warming leads to a rapid rise in precipitation over the majority of the ISM region. Parts of the Gangetic plain, the southern Peninsula, the Arabian Peninsula, and Bangladesh are projected to have statistically significant increases in precipitation, as are the Bay of Bengal and the north Equatorial Indian Ocean. Similar to the 1pctCO2 scenario (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c), the south equatorial Indian Ocean and maritime continent are projected to receive less rainfall as compared to preindustrial levels after the termination of geoengineering.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Mechanisms of change and conclusions</title><p id="Par18">Response on the mean conditions of the Indian summer monsoon to global warming (1% per annum rising rate of CO<sub>2</sub>), solar geoengineering (gradual reduction of the solar constant to balance the changing radiative forcing due to the rising rate of CO<sub>2</sub>), and its abrupt termination are analyzed in this study. Because the Asian monsoon-system involves complex feedbacks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, finding cause-and-effect relationships is not simple. Also, over the ISM region, domain average multi model mean inter annual variability (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) tends to be potentially obscuring the mechanisms. Nevertheless, by examining spatial changes in temperature, precipitation, wind fields, and moisture convergence, we are able to ascertain some conclusions about how the ISM may change under idealized scenarios.</p><p id="Par19">Under global warming, surface air temperature over land increases more than over ocean, strengthening the well-documented summer season land ocean temperature gradient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, thus strengthening the low-level (near 850&#x000a0;hPa) monsoon circulation. This strengthening of low level monsoon circulation (Somali jet) brings in more moisture and enhanced evaporation over land due to rise in temperature, resulting in enhancement of precipitation near the west coast of India, east Arabian Sea and peninsular India. At upper levels, the TEJ is projected to progressively weaken under global warming, likely resulting in the reduction of vertical wind shear. The reduced wind shear conditions would enable more depressions to become cyclones in the Bay of Bengal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, and correspondingly increase precipitation and associated wide spread flood conditions in the region near the east coast of India. This weakening of the TEJ can be associated with the reduction in the magnitude of the meridional temperature gradient (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) at upper levels due to the warming of the upper troposphere over the equatorial Indian Ocean caused by latent heat release from enhanced convection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In contrast, over Indian longitudes (60 to 100&#x000b0;E), the STWJ strengthens and shifts southward under the global warming scenario but its effect (decrease in precipitation) seems to be over shadowed by the above-discussed effects of the TEJ and the Somali Jet. Thus, under global warming, increase in the strength of the low-level monsoon circulation and higher amounts of moisture in the atmosphere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> both result in enhancement of precipitation over the ISM region.</p><p id="Par20">On the other hand, solar geoengineering under experiment G2, compensates the global average surface warming and may cause a slight cooling over the majority of the ISM region. At upper levels, the TEJ and STWJ are projected to strengthen. At lower levels, Somali Jet is projected to strengthen but spatially irregularly. This strengthening of the Somali jet is likely to be due to residual warming near the Somali coast. The precipitation is projected to increase near the windward side of the Western Ghats and decrease over majority of the Indian land. The preferential precipitation over the windward side of the Western Ghats could likely be due to increased moisture convergence in the Somali Jet exit region. The initial triggering of precipitation due to moisture convergence over the eastern Arabian Sea and the west coast of India, may then sustain the Somali Jet by feedback effects. Since the moisture carried by the Somali Jet is not able to reach the Indian land due to preferential precipitation over the windward side of Western Ghats, and reduction of sunlight at the surface leads to less evapo-transpiration leads to less water vapour and thus a dry bias is noted over Indian land<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. At upper levels, the projected residual cooling of the tropics and residual heating of the subtropics (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) results in strengthening of the meridional temperature gradient, thus increasing TEJ speed. Thus, it is noted that wind (monsoon) circulation at upper and lower levels gets strengthened in scenario G2. However, precipitation over the majority of the ISM region is reduced. This result agrees with some of the previous<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> findings that ISM precipitation will decrease under solar reduction scenario. Abrupt termination of the geoengineering results in a sudden increase in temperature throughout the globe. Over the ISM region, termination of geoengineering is found to induce conditions similar to a prolonged global warming condition with a strengthening of the Somali Jet and weakening of TEJ, resulting in an increase of precipitation over the ISM region.</p><p id="Par21">While the analysis presented here utilizes a multi model mean approach, the presence of very limited statistically significant regions under the geoengineered scenario highlights the need for regional studies in the context of geoengineering with large ensembles of targeted numerical modeling experiments. Further, with sudden termination of G2 leads to large increases in temperature and increases in precipitation indicate a potential risk of drought and wide spread floods respectively. Thus, many more downstream climate impact studies are needed for a more holistic assessment at the socioeconomic level.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Data and methodology</title><p id="Par22">The data used in this study is from Coupled Model Intercomparion Project (CMIP) and Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP).
