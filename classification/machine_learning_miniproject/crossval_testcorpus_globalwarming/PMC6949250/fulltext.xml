Combined with expected increase in rain rates associated with TCs in a warmer climate, there is growing interest in TC translation speed in the past and future. Here we present that a slowdown trend of the translation speed is not simulated for the period 1951&#x02013;2011 based on historical model simulations. We also find that the annual-mean translation speed could increase under global warming. Although previous studies show large uncertainties in the future projections of TC characteristics, our model simulations show that the average TC translation speed at higher latitudes becomes smaller in a warmer climate, but the relative frequency of TCs at higher latitudes increases. Since the translation speed is much larger in the extratropics, the increase in the relative frequency of TCs at higher latitudes compensates the reduction of the translation speed there, leading to a global mean increase in TC translation speed.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">How the translation speed of tropical cyclones has changed in recent decades and will change in the future has been the subject of debate.

Translation speed of TCs is one important feature because the slower TCs move, the longer is their influence time, and the greater is the impact of severe weather events associated with TCs such as heavy rain and strong winds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In relation to the anticipated increase in precipitation associated with TCs in the future<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, how the translation speed of TCs has changed in recent decades and will change in a future warmer climate is an area of active research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Kossin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> (hereafter, K18) concluded, based on observational data (known as best-track data; see Data availability), that the translation speed of TCs has decreased globally by 10% between 1949 and 2016, possibly due to global warming. The magnitude of the slowdown varies from basin to basin, with the largest slowdown being in the western North Pacific basin. However, Moon et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> (hereafter, M19) cast doubts on K18&#x02019;s conclusions, pointing out that such a slowdown trend arose mainly due to the lack of detection of weak and over-the-sea TCs, which have a relatively slow translation speed, in the pre-satellite era (1965 and before). Because it is impossible to reproduce the observational data during the pre-satellite era with the same quality as those in the post-satellite era, we propose to analyze results of numerical simulations for the current and future climates.</p><p id="Par4">Here the following two questions are at the center of discussion in this study. The first question is whether there exists a decreasing trend in the translation speed of TCs during the historical period, and the second is how the translation speed might change in the future warmer climate. Results from the model used in this study show that the global mean TC translation speed has not slowed down in the past, but under global warming, they will in general speed up due to a poleward shift in their mean track location, although those moving into the extratropics slow down.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Reproducibility of observed translation speeds by model simulations</title><p id="Par5">In this study, we use results of high-resolution large-ensemble simulations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> (see Methods). It is important that these simulations reproduce important aspects of the observed TC frequency and distribution under current climate conditions in order to address the above questions with some confidence. Yoshida et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> (hereafter, Y17) showed that the simulated annual TC genesis and TC distribution match the observations quite well (see Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, c</xref> of Y17). Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the time series of annual-mean translation speed of TCs from the observations and simulations for the current climate for the globe and the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, respectively (see Methods). Here the primary period of comparison between the observations and simulations is limited to 1982 to 2011 when data from geostationary satellites are available globally. It is relatively unlikely that any TC would go undetected in the post-geostationary satellite era, as compared to the pre-satellite era, and thus the best-track data are almost certainly more homogeneous and reliable since 1982. The simulations reproduce the observation-based global annual-mean translation speed in the post-geostationary satellite era very well, with both the observations and simulations having a period average of 17.6&#x02009;km/h. The degree of similarity between the observations and simulations varies by the hemisphere and basin, but it is relatively high in the western North Pacific, North Atlantic, Northern Indian, and South Pacific basins (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Global and hemispheric time series of annual-mean tropical cyclone translation speed from the observations and simulations.</title><p><bold>a</bold>&#x02013;<bold>c</bold> The period of the time series is 1951&#x02013;2011.

Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the TC translation speed against latitudes globally and in the western North Pacific basin, respectively. In the evaluation for the post-geostationary satellite era (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b, d</xref>), the simulations reproduce the latitudinal distribution of translation speed relatively well.</p><p id="Par7">There are, however, some deficiencies in the simulations. For example, differences in the translation speed between the observations and simulations can be seen in some basins such as the eastern North Pacific basin even in the post-geostationary satellite era (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The standard deviation of the translation speed in the simulations is smaller than that of the observations in the North Atlantic basin (note that smaller year-to-year variations in the annual-mean translation speed in the simulations is due to the smoothing resulting from averaging a large number of ensemble simulations). But overall it can be concluded that the simulations reproduce the translation speed of the observations in the post-satellite era realistically and can therefore be used to compare with observations for trend analyses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>TC translation speed in the past</title><p id="Par8">Returning to the first question as to whether there exists a slowdown trend in the translation speed of TCs in the current climate, neither global nor hemispheric model simulation results show a decrease in the translation speed from 1951 to 2011 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This is also true for simulations in each TC basin (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Another point to notice from Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> is that the translation speed based on the observations is larger than that from the simulations in the pre-satellite era, and the difference between them is notably seen globally and in the western North Pacific basin. Such discrepancy between the observations and simulations is also clearly seen in the comparison of the latitudinal distributions of the translation speed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, c</xref>). These results suggest that, consistent with the conclusions of M19, inhomogeneities in the observational data may be one of the reasons for the decrease in the translation speed proposed by K18.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>TC translation speed in the future</title><p id="Par9">The high-resolution large-ensemble simulations were conducted not only for the current climate but also for the future climate over the period 2051&#x02013;2110 assuming a 4&#x02009;K surface warming from the pre-industrial level (see Methods). Comparisons of the simulation results between the current and future climates enable us to explore the second question: how the translation speed might change in a future warmer climate. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows the comparison of the annual-mean TC translation speed for the current and future climates. The translation speed averaged over 1951&#x02013;2011 and over 2051&#x02013;2110 globally is 17.5 and 18.0&#x02009;km/h, respectively, suggesting that the translation speed may increase in the future. A statistically significant increase is also simulated for some individual basins, including the western North Pacific, North Atlantic, and South Pacific basins.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Changes in the tropical cyclone translation speed between the current and future climates.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Current climate</th><th>Future Climate</th><th><italic>p</italic> Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Global</td><td>17.5</td><td>18.0</td><td>&#x0003c;0.001</td></tr><tr><td>Northern Hemisphere</td><td>18.3</td><td>18.6</td><td>&#x0003c;0.001</td></tr><tr><td>Southern Hemisphere</td><td>16.0</td><td>16.3</td><td>&#x0003c;0.001</td></tr><tr><td>North Atlantic</td><td>22.1</td><td>22.6</td><td>&#x0003c;0.001</td></tr><tr><td>Western North Pacific</td><td>18.2</td><td>18.4</td><td>0.017</td></tr><tr><td>Eastern North Pacific</td><td>18.5</td><td>18.7</td><td>0.305</td></tr><tr><td>Northern Indian</td><td>13.8</td><td>13.7</td><td>0.106</td></tr><tr><td>Southern Indian</td><td>15.9</td><td>15.8</td><td>0.140</td></tr><tr><td>South Pacific</td><td>16.1</td><td>17.0</td><td>&#x0003c;0.001</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>The translation speeds (km/h) are either a global, hemispheric, or basin mean.

In a future warmer climate, the westerly winds are expected to weaken due to the decrease in baroclinicity in the atmosphere. Since the westerly winds play an important role as the steering flow of TCs, these weakened westerly winds will lead to a reduction in the TC translation speed in the extratropics (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> shows the latitudinal distribution of the translation speed in the current and future climates in the global domain. In a warmer climate, the average translation speed decreases in the extratropics compared to the current climate. A similar translation speed decrease in the extratropics is seen in each TC basin except for the Southern Indian Ocean basin (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Changes in the tropical cyclone translation speed, tropical cyclone absolute, and relative frequency against latitudes.</title><p><bold>a</bold>&#x02013;<bold>c</bold> The range of the latitude is 0&#x02013;40&#x000b0; with 5&#x000b0; interval, and the speed and both frequencies are globally averaged at each latitudinal bin.

A relatively large reduction in the TC absolute frequency in the tropics and sub-tropics results in an increase in the relative frequency of TCs in the extratropics. This result holds even when the samples are limited to categories 4 and 5 TCs (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Because the TC translation speed in the extratropics is much larger than that in the tropics and sub-tropics, the increase in the relative frequency of TCs in the extratropics could result in an increase in the global annual-mean translation speed in spite of the slowdown of the translation speed in the extratropics. In other words, the annual global mean translation speed change in a warmer climate depends on which is the dominant contribution: the reduction of the average translation speed in the extratropics or the poleward shift of TC frequency.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par12">The increase in relative frequency of TCs in the extratropics seen in the model simulations used in this study can be inferred from other model simulation studies through geographical distribution of TC frequency difference between the current and future warmer climates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The decrease in TC frequency at around 15&#x000b0; North/South in the North Atlantic, western North Pacific, and the Southern Hemisphere in a warmer climate, which leads to the increase in relative frequency of TCs in the extratropics, is a common feature among the model simulations. Wehner et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> directly assessed the future change in relative frequency of TCs with latitudes. Their results are qualitatively the same as those from our model simulations: decrease at around 15&#x000b0; North/South or less and an increase at around 20&#x000b0; North/South or more.</p><p id="Par13">It is also true that there are large uncertainties in the future projections of various characteristics of TC activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. For example, some model simulations suggest an increase in the global<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and western North Pacific<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> TC frequency under a warmer climate. Nakamura et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> showed through multi-model analyses that there is a large range of uncertainty across numerical simulations as to whether a poleward shift of TC occurrence exists in the western North Pacific basin, where there has been the largest trend in the observations for the lifetime maximum intensity of TCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and TC genesis location<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, although the combined multi-model signal has a statistically significant poleward shift in a warmer climate. In the North Atlantic, Daloz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> did not find any significant TC track changes in the future. Ramsay et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> did not find a consistent poleward shift in the Southern Hemisphere TC tracks across multiple models, either. These previous studies could potentially lead to a different conclusion on the future change in the TC translation speed from this study. The bimodal distribution of TC intensity proposed by Lee et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> may not be represented well by our 60-km atmospheric model, which could potentially modify our conclusions. In addition, an atmosphere&#x02013;ocean coupling effect could have a role in modulating the relative frequency of TCs. For example, some intense TCs could reach higher latitudes without influence of ocean cooling, while an ocean subsurface warming might cause an increase in the TC frequency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Thus further investigation using an ocean-coupled model with finer grid spacing will be needed in the future.</p><p id="Par14">The global or basin mean translation speed of TCs really depends on the latitudinal distribution of TCs. The mean translation speed alone can be misleading when discussing the future change in the translation speed at a certain latitude and assessing its social and economic impact. Thus, the whole histogram of TC translation speed at each latitudinal band is also an important metric. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows the histogram of the TC translation speed at each latitudinal band with 10&#x000b0; interval. The relative frequency of TC translation speed of 20&#x02009;km/h or less increases in the future at a 0&#x02013;10&#x000b0; latitude band, but it does not mean that the absolute number of such slow-moving TCs increases there in the future compared to the current climate. The difference between the current and future climates is more clearly seen at a 30&#x02013;40&#x000b0; latitude band. Both the absolute and relative frequencies of TC translation speed of 30&#x02009;km/h or less (more) tend to increase (decrease) in the future, although there is a large variability among the basins (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>Changes in the tropical cyclone absolute and relative frequency against translation speeds.</title><p><bold>a</bold>&#x02013;<bold>h</bold> The range of the translation speed is 0&#x02013;80 (km/h) with 10 (km/h) interval, and absolute (<bold>a</bold>, <bold>c</bold>, <bold>e</bold>, <bold>g</bold>) and relative (<bold>b</bold>, <bold>d</bold>, <bold>f</bold>, <bold>h</bold>) frequencies are globally averaged at each translation speed bin and at each latitudinal band from 0&#x000b0; to 10&#x000b0; (<bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold>), 10&#x000b0; to 20&#x000b0; (<bold>c</bold>, <bold>d</bold>), 20&#x000b0; to 30&#x000b0; (<bold>e</bold>, <bold>f</bold>), and 30&#x000b0; to 40&#x000b0; (<bold>g</bold>, <bold>h</bold>).

Second, with an increase in the relative frequency of TCs at higher latitudes in a warmer future climate, it is expected that the global average translation speed could be higher than that in the present day.</p><p id="Par16">Care must be taken in the interpretation of this second conclusion.

However, it highly depends on the frequency of TC occurrence at various latitudes and in different basins and would not be a meaningful metric for disaster risk prevention and for assessing the potential impact of TCs associated with their influence of time at a given location. Thus, an important implication of this study for the disaster-preparedness communities, especially for those at higher latitudes, is that while it is likely that TC translation speeds in the tropics would remain largely unchanged under global warming, those at the higher latitudes would decrease in spite of the fact that the global and/or basin-wide mean translation speeds may increase in the future. Furthermore, the poleward shift of the relative frequency of TCs is fundamental for the conclusions of this study, but previous studies show that there are large uncertainties in projections of changes in TC tracks simulated in numerical models. Thus, further investigation will be needed in the future to better understand the causes of such uncertainties as well as to reduce them.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Model descriptions</title><p id="Par17">The large-ensemble simulations were conducted by an atmospheric global circulation model (AGCM). The AGCM used in this study is the Meteorological Research Institute AGCM, version 3.2 (MRI-AGCM3.2) with a 60&#x02009;km horizontal grid spacing, which is exactly the same as MRI-AGCM3.2H listed in the CMIP5 archive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. In the simulations for the historical period, the observed monthly mean sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice concentration from COBE-SST2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> are used as the lower boundary conditions. The period of the simulations is 60 years (1951&#x02013;2010) and the ensemble size is 100. In addition to using different initial conditions, small perturbations of SST based on its analysis error are adopted for the ensemble experiments. Global mean concentrations of greenhouse gases are set to the observational values for each year. A future climate scenario in which the global mean surface air temperature is assumed to be 4&#x02009;K warmer than the pre-industrial climate is simulated, corresponding to the global warming around the end of the twenty-first century under the representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) scenario of CMIP5. The amplitude of the warming is kept constant throughout the simulations. The period of the simulations is 60 years and the ensemble size is 90. Six CMIP5 models are used for obtaining the warming pattern of the SST and each pattern is added to the observational SST of 1951&#x02013;2010. For each warming pattern, 15-member ensemble experiments are conducted using different initial conditions and sea surface perturbations for each SST change.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>TC tracking method</title><p id="Par18">The TC tracking is based on the model outputs, including sea level pressure, 850&#x02009;hPa relative vorticity, 850&#x02009;hPa and surface wind speed, vertical wind shear between 850 and 300&#x02009;hPa, warm core temperature, and duration period<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Appropriate threshold values of these variables are chosen so that the global number of TC geneses detected in the current climate simulations by MRI-AGCM3.2H is close to that observed. Compared to other explicit detection methods, the TC tracking method in the present study does not show large differences in TC detection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Calculation of translation speed and frequency</title><p id="Par19">The TC tracking data include the central position of TCs every 6&#x02009;h. For each ensemble member and each year, we calculated great-circle distance between two locations along TC tracks and computed the annual average translation speed of the ensemble member for the year. We repeated this computation for all ensemble members and then took an ensemble mean to obtain the annual-mean translation speed. The absolute frequency is calculated by counting the number of 6-hourly tracked TC central locations that meet the conditions of the latitudinal or translation speed bins.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec11"><p>
