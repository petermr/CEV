Short-term field experiments with non-social bees showed that adult emergence is responsive to nest substrate temperatures.

Resolving these competing scenarios requires evidence for bees' natural plasticity in their annual emergence schedules. This study reports direct observations spanning 12-24 years for annual variation in the earliest nesting or foraging activities by 1-4 populations of four native ground-nesting bees: <i>Andrena fulva</i> (Andrenidae)<i>, Halictus rubicundus</i> (Halictidae)<i>, Habropoda laboriosa</i> and <i>Eucera</i> (<i>Peponapis</i>) <i>pruinosa</i> (Apidae).

Similar seasonal flexibilities in bee emergence and wildflower bloom schedules bodes well for bees and bloom to generally retain synchrony despite a warming climate.
