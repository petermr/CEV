Supermarkets consume around 50 kWh/ft<sup>2</sup> of electricity annually. The biggest consumer of energy in a supermarket is its refrigeration system, which accounts for 40%-60% of its total electricity usage and is equivalent to about 2%-3% of the total energy consumed by commercial buildings in the United States. Also, the supermarket refrigeration system is one of the biggest consumers of refrigerants. Reducing refrigerant usage or using environmentally friendly alternatives can result in significant climate benefits. A challenge is the lack of publicly available data sets to benchmark the system performance and record the faulted performance.
