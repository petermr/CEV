On the basis of measurement of rice responses to climate and carbon dioxide concentration ([CO<sub>2</sub>]), the dynamic process model named SIMRIW was developed to predict global warming effects on irrigated rice. The model predicted differential regional effects of the projected global warming by doubling [CO<sub>2</sub>] on the rice yield over Asia, and indicated that high tolerance to heat-induced spikelet sterility and high yield potential under elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] are the two important characteristics required for rice genotypes adaptive to global warming environment. Further, genetic traits associated with these characteristics and their genetic resources for breeding adaptive genotypes were identified from diverse rice germplasms. This article reviews our initiative studies in the light of the recent studies, and points out further research that is needed for better understanding and overcoming of this unprecedentedly large problem.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>climate change</kwd><kwd>rice</kwd><kwd>Asia</kwd><kwd>modeling</kwd><kwd>impact assessment</kwd><kwd>adaptation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>In the 1980s, projections of global warming appeared as an unprecedented enormous problem that could be threatening to the future human societies. The General Circulation Models (GCMs) of earth&#x02019;s atmosphere predicted that, when rapidly increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentration ([CO<sub>2</sub>]) in the atmosphere would double the concentration of the beginning of the last century, then the global mean temperature would increase as much as more than 4 &#x02103;.<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>)</sup> Since such a significant temperature rise was considered to give enormously large influences on diverse areas of human societies, the impact assessment of global warming on the societies became an urgent issue to be considered by the scientists. Agriculture is one of the most vulnerably affected sectors by the global warming, and many international studies for the impact assessments were initiated in the period of 1980s to early 1990s.<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>)</sup> From the beginning of these studies, the authors&#x02019; group participated in the impact assessment of the global warming on rice cultures in Japan and Asia.</p><p>Rice is the most important crop in Asia, providing major portion of dietary energy and vocations for more than 40 billion people living there. Further increase of rice production is required to meet the increasing demand caused by the population increase and economic development. However, increase in rice yield was stagnated around 1990, when the expansion of &#x02018;Green Revolution&#x02019; technologies that contributed for the increase in yield were nearly terminated.<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>)</sup> While breaking through the rice yield stagnation was a hard challenge for scientists, the projection of global warming added another difficult situation on Asian rice production. The primary concern is to predict the effects of projected global warming on Asian rice production, and to find ways for adaptive rice production technologies.</p><p>Since global warming is an unprecedented, traditional statistical model which relies on the past data could not be applicable to the prediction of its effects. Thus, we had developed a process-based mechanistic rice model named SIMRIW (Simulation Model for Rice-Weather Relationships) to predict growth and yields of irrigated rice, based on physiological and physical processes of rice response to climate.<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>)</sup> Also, experimental work was conducted to obtain necessary data for SIMRIW on [CO<sub>2</sub>] by temperature effects on rice growth and yield, using newly developed Temperature Gradient Chamber (TGC),<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>)</sup> as the availability of relevant data had been limited to those reports.<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>)</sup> Using SIMRIW, thus developed, we predicted the effects of doubled [CO<sub>2</sub>] and projected global warming on the production of irrigated rice in Japan<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>)</sup> and Asia.<sup><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>)</sup> Analyses by SIMRIW and its succeeding model GEMRICE (Genotype by Environment Interaction Simulation Model for Rice Growth and Yield)<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>)</sup> revealed that higher tolerance to heat-induced spikelet sterility at flowering stage<sup><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>)</sup> and higher yielding potential<sup><xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>)</sup> under elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] are required for adaptive rice genotypes to projected future environments, and also to meet the increasing rice demand in Asia. We further investigated on the mechanisms and traits determining the heat tolerance of rice at flowering stage<sup><xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>)</sup> and the yield potential,<sup><xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>)</sup> and explored for genetic resources for the traits, which were necessary for the development of adaptive rice cultivars to projected global warming.<sup><xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>)</sup></p><p>Our initial studies on the impact assessment of and adaptation to global warming on rice production in Asia were conducted in mid 1990s. Since then, a quite large number of studies, recently, have been made on modeling the impacts of global warming on rice,<sup><xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>)</sup> and measurements of heat-induced spikelet sterility at flowering stage<sup><xref rid="r57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>)</sup> and on rice responses to [CO<sub>2</sub>].<sup><xref rid="r70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>)</sup> These subsequent studies have added new findings in the research area of climate change and rice production. The objectives of this article are to review the results of the previous studies of the author&#x02019;s group in the light of these recent studies, and to identify the important research areas for further studies that could help in providing a better understanding of climate change effects on Asian rice production and for developing adaptive rice production technologies to the projected global warming.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other1"><label>2</label><title>The current situation in rice production in Asia and projected global warming</title><p>Rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.) originated from middle area of the Pearl River in southern China<sup><xref rid="r79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>)</sup> for more than 10,000 years ago, and then it gradually spread over the world and became one of the most important crops along with wheat and maize that sustain over seven billion world population. As rice is a well-adapted crop to warm and humid climates of monsoon Asia from its origin, it has become the dominant crop in East, Southeast and South Asia (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>).<sup><xref rid="r80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>)</sup> Rice farming has now expanded to as north as Heihe city (50.2 &#x000b0;N), Northeast China, owing to the technological innovations. In the tropics region, intensive land use of double or triple rice cropping is practiced by the development of irrigation systems. Rice has provided major portion of dietary energy and vocations for its farming, for people living in Monsoon Asia for thousands of years.</p><p>With the increase in the population, rice production in Asia was increased by about 3 times in the last half century, mainly through the yield increase by the technology innovation referred to as &#x02018;Green Revolution&#x02019;. Around 1990 when the expansion of the &#x02018;Green Revolution&#x02019; technology was nearly terminated in Asia, where it was applicable, however, increase in the rice yield slackened in most Asian countries.<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>)</sup> Given the future increase in food demands with the population increase and economic development, it is required to break through the current stagnation in rice yield increase by the creation of more productive rice production technologies. Although the challenges for technology innovation for the 2nd Green Revolution have been continued by world rice workers, its goal is yet unclear.</p><p>The projected global warming caused by the increase in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>)</sup> is another enormous factor that makes future food security in Asia, uncertain. With the increase in the human activities such as fossil fuel combustion, industrial productions and land use changes, rapid increases have been observed in the concentration of carbon dioxide ([CO<sub>2</sub>]), methane ([CH<sub>4</sub>]) and nitrous oxide ([N<sub>2</sub>O]) in the atmosphere. The IPCC indicated that the atmospheric [CO<sub>2</sub>], [CH<sub>4</sub>] and [N<sub>2</sub>O] have increased to the levels that are unprecedented for at least 800,000 years and also, [CO<sub>2</sub>] has increased by 40% since pre-industrial times.<sup><xref rid="r81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>)</sup> Since the initial studies<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>)</sup> on General Circulation Models (GCMs) that predicted global warming caused by the increase in the [CO<sub>2</sub>], many GCMs of various structures have also been developed. The fifth assessment report of IPCC (2013)<sup><xref rid="r81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>)</sup> showed the global climate changes predicted by various GCMs under four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) of greenhouse gases. The four RCPs employed the radiative forcing of 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5 Wm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> of greenhouse gases by the year 2100, to which atmospheric [CO<sub>2</sub>] of 421, 538, 670 and 936 ppm corresponded, respectively. The projected temperature increase not only strongly depends upon the RCP scenarios that reflect itself through the future human efforts to minimize anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, but also on GCMs. The ranges of the increase in annual mean surface air temperature in the year 2100 by various GCMs are 0.3&#x02013;1.7 &#x02103; for RCP2.6, 1.1&#x02013;2.6 &#x02103; for RCP4.5, 1.4&#x02013;3.1 &#x02103; for RCP6.0 and 2.6&#x02013;4.8 &#x02103; for RCP8.5, respectively,<sup><xref rid="r81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>)</sup> which are lower than the earlier predictions made in the late 1980s, when compared at a same level of [CO<sub>2</sub>].</p><p>Despite a large uncertainty in the predicted future climate, it is important to clarify the potential effects of climate change on Asian rice productions, in order to identify vulnerable areas to climate change and to develop strategies for adaptation of rice culture to global warming, and also for ensuring future food security in Asia under the pressures of increasing population and rice demand.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other2"><label>3</label><title>Measurements of rice responses to elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] and temperature</title><p>To assess the impact of unprecedented environmental conditions, which includes high [CO<sub>2</sub>] in the atmosphere and high temperature rise, on rice production in Asia, the basic data on rice responses to elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] and supra-optimal temperatures was found indispensable.

At night time, the direction of the air was reversed, and the heated air by an oil-heater at the daytime exhaust end was led into TGC to create a temperature gradient along the long-axis of TGC due to natural cooling. The later type of TGC was installed with 20 m-long electric heat cables along its long axis to supply heating energy in night time and cloudy days, instead of the oil heater. This enabled not to reverse wind direction in night time. Rates of airflow and CO<sub>2</sub> release were controlled by a computer to maintain the temperature difference between the two ends of TGC at 5 &#x02103; and [CO<sub>2</sub>] at 700 ppm.</p><p>The initial TGC was designed for [CO<sub>2</sub>] &#x000d7; temperature treatment on pot-grown rice plants that were placed on the soil surface in TGC, but in the next year (1992), a mini paddy field with 25 m in length, 1.25 m in width and 0.3 m in soil depth was installed in it by filling paddy soil in the plastic film container buried in the ground of TGC. Penetration of solar radiation from side borders of rice canopy on the mini paddy field was prevented by extending the shading cloth along the long axis of TGC. Thus, the TGC enabled to give long-term [CO<sub>2</sub>] &#x000d7; temperature treatments on rice under near field conditions while allowing natural diurnal cycles of solar radiation and temperature by merely amplifying the temperature proportionately to the distance from the air inlet.</p></sec><sec><label>3.2</label><title>Rice responses to [CO<sub>2</sub>] &#x000d7; temperature &#x02014;Major results from TGC experiments&#x02014;.</title><p>The [CO<sub>2</sub>] &#x000d7; temperature treatments on rice in TGC, was conducted for 5 cropping seasons for the years &#x02013; 1991 to 1995.

Further, the doubled [CO<sub>2</sub>] in TGC increased the canopy diffusion resistance of water vapor and CO<sub>2</sub> by 49% for cv. Akihikari and 40% for cv.

The difference in the [CO<sub>2</sub>] response of rice biomass and yield between FACE and chamber experiments might be due to the difference in [CO<sub>2</sub>] concentration (about 550 ppm in FACE and 700 ppm in TGC), cultivar and environment, partially.</p><p>However, the lower responses to [CO<sub>2</sub>] in FACE than those in chamber experiments were also reported for other crops such as wheat and soybean.<sup><xref rid="r96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>)</sup> The higher [CO<sub>2</sub>] responses of crops in growth chamber experiments were sometimes attributed to some artifacts in growth chamber experiments (<italic>e.g.</italic> ref. <xref rid="r96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>). However, a careful consideration seems necessary on large temporal [CO<sub>2</sub>] fluctuations in FACE by its nature: a temporal fluctuation of about &#x000b1;100 ppm around the target [CO<sub>2</sub>] (about 550 ppm) could be seen in the measured [CO<sub>2</sub>] in FACE.<sup><xref rid="r97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>)</sup> As it was shown that [CO<sub>2</sub>] response curve of rice canopy photosynthesis and yield nearly reached to plateaus at [CO<sub>2</sub>] around 600 ppm,<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>)</sup> a positive [CO<sub>2</sub>] deviation from the target in FACE might give only a small positive effect on photosynthesis and yield, but a negative deviation might give a larger negative effect on them. This could be a cause, at least partly, for the lower response to [CO<sub>2</sub>] in the biomass and yield of rice in FACE than those in growth chamber experiments. More research is necessary on the causes for the gathering quantitative difference in crop responses to [CO<sub>2</sub>] between FACE and chamber experiments, including the effects of [CO<sub>2</sub>] fluctuations on crop photosynthesis, growth and yield.</p></sec><sec><label>3.3</label><title>Heat-induced spikelet sterility as a function of temperature.</title><p>The TGC experiments showed that higher temperatures induce spikelet sterility in rice, which moreover offsets the increased grain yield by elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>].

The yield, thus determined, is termed as actual yield. Except for climate, the other environmental factors can be found manageable, and so, the crop yield under an optimum management, which depends only on climate, is referred to as the potential yield, which can be considered as the upper limit of crop yield at a given location and year. Among climatic factors, the temperature and solar radiation are known to play dominating roles in crop yield determination, so that the potential yield can be defined as the maximum yield determined by crop characteristics, and temperature and solar radiation conditions.<sup><xref rid="r108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>)</sup> The objective of the model SIMRIW was to predict the potential growth and yield of irrigated rice at given locations or regions and years. The original version of SIMRIW was developed in 1987 to predict the potential rice yield under the present climate conditions and it was expanded in 1993 to make it applicable for the projected future environment of increased atmospheric [CO<sub>2</sub>] and temperature.</p><p>An important concept of SIMRIW development was to model rice growth and yield formation as simple as possible, by focusing on the essential processes through which solar radiation and temperature determine the growth and yield, in order to minimize the numbers of empirical parameters and to make the model globally applicable. On the basis of this concept, SIMRIW consists of four major processes of phenological development, biomass growth, leaf area expansion and yield formation.</p><p>The phenological development processes of rice, such as the time of panicle initiation, flowering and maturity, are primarily important in determining rice adaptability to environment, and are strongly influenced both by environment and crop genotypes.

Then, the crop growth rate under different [CO<sub>2</sub>] can be obtained by multiplying Eq. [<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="e04">4</xref>] by Eq. [<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="e05">5</xref>].</p><p>The Leaf Area Index (LAI), that is, the total leaf area over a unit land area, is the crop variable that determines the radiation interception rate and hence, the crop growth rate. The LAI is usually calculated by multiplying crop leaf weight per unit land area by specific leaf area (m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), that is, the ratio of leaf area to leaf weight. However, the adoption of this traditional method for crop growth model requires many empirical parameters for describing the specific leaf area and biomass partitioning to leaves as functions of <italic>DVI</italic> and environments.<sup><xref rid="r115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>)</sup> Moreover, this approach allows a strong positive feedback between the rates of crop biomass growth and leaf expansion through Eq. [<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="e04">4</xref>], so that any small bias in the empirical equations that relate crop biomass with LAI, could result in large errors in the simulated values of <italic>W</italic> and LAI over a period of time. In order to avoid these problems, the leaf expansion growth was modeled independently of biomass growth in SIMRIW, although, it is doubtless that the leaf expansion needs substances. The major environmental factors that limit leaf expansion growth under field conditions are known to be temperature, water and nitrogen nutrient. In irrigated rice under optimally managed conditions of plant nutrients, the leaf expansion growth until heading was modeled as a function of only daily mean temperature as follows:<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)</sup><disp-formula id="e06"><graphic xlink:href="pjab-95-211-e006.jpg" position="float" orientation="portrait"/><label>[6]</label></disp-formula>Where <italic>F</italic> is the LAI, <italic>Q</italic> is the maximum relative rate of leaf expansion (d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) at optimum temperature, <italic>Tr</italic> is the minimum temperature for leaf expansion, <italic>Fm</italic> is the maximum LAI at heading of rice, and <italic>Kr</italic> and &#x003b7; are empirical constants. Since the radiation interception by crop canopies reaches the maximum at LAI about 5 and any further increase in LAI shows a little effect on biomass growth, a value of 6 was given to <italic>Fm</italic>. After the heading of rice, no new leaves are produced and LAI gradually decreases, coupled with leaf senescence. However, the physiology of leaf senescence is not well understood. For this reason, changes in LAI from the time of heading to crop maturity was described in SIMRIW as a function of the Crop Developmental Index (DVI).</p><p>The yield is a part of the whole biomass weight that a crop accumulated until the maturity. SIMRIW employs this principle for modeling the yield formation process of rice. Namely,<disp-formula id="e07"><graphic xlink:href="pjab-95-211-e007.jpg" position="float" orientation="portrait"/><label>[7]</label></disp-formula>where <italic>Y</italic> is the dry weight of brown rice (g m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>), <italic>W</italic> is the whole crop dry weight including roots at maturity (g m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>), and <italic>H</italic><sub><italic>v</italic></sub> is the proportionality constant termed harvest index. The harvest index strongly depends on rice genotypes, but is generally constant over a wide range of environments except for rice receiving damages, specifically to panicles by adverse environments. The climatic factors that give the most harmful damages, specifically to rice panicle are cool and high temperatures below and above the respective critical temperatures during the reproductive development period. The cool temperatures below about 20 &#x02103; at the meiosis stage of pollen development (about 12 days prior to heading) suppress pollen development and those at the flowering stage hinder pollination. Also, the higher temperatures above approximately 35 &#x02103; at flowering stage hinder pollination in rice spikelets.<sup><xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="r98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>)</sup> All of these harmful temperatures induce spikelet sterility and reduce the harvest index. Further, premature cessation of growth caused by continued cool temperatures below a threshold or frost during the grain filling period reduces the harvest index.</p><p>By taking into account the spikelet sterility induced by these harmful temperatures, the harvest index (<italic>H</italic><sub><italic>v</italic></sub>) was modeled as a function of the fraction of sterile spikelet (&#x003b3;) and <italic>DVI</italic>:<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>)</sup><disp-formula id="e08"><graphic xlink:href="pjab-95-211-e008.jpg" position="float" orientation="portrait"/><label>[8]</label></disp-formula>where <italic>H</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> is the maximum harvest index of a given cultivar and <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub> is an empirical constant.

The model terminates when either <italic>DVI</italic> reaches 2.0 (full maturation) or when the crop encounters three days with daily mean temperature less than a critical temperature for growth (premature cessation of growth).

They were compared to the actual yields of those regions averaged over 5-year period from 1980 to 1984 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6</xref>, top).<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)</sup> The potential yields were evaluated by using crop physiological parameters determined for cv. IR36, one of the highest yielding rice cultivars in the 1980s and normal climate data in the respective regions at that time. The potential yields were also compared to the actual yields of the respective regions averaged over the 5-year period from 2010 to 2014, assuming that the potential yields under the normal climates were unchanged (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6</xref>, bottom).<sup><xref rid="r117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>)</sup> In the 1980 to 1984 period, SIMRIW well explained the variation in the average rice yield over the respective prefectures in Japan and that over the respective states in the U.S.A. However, the relationship between the evaluated potential yield and the actual yield for the respective regions were clearly on different regression lines between Japan and the U.S.A. The following regression equation could be applied for the actual yields (<italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>) against the potential yields (<italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>), both in Japan and the U.S.A.:<disp-formula id="e09"><graphic xlink:href="pjab-95-211-e009.jpg" position="float" orientation="portrait"/><label>[9]</label></disp-formula>in which <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> is the technology coefficient to represent the extent to which the attained actual rice yield is to the potential yield expected from the climate. In the 1980 to 1984 period, the technology coefficient in Japan was 0.49 and that in the U.S.A. was 0.38, indicating that overall rice production technologies measured by the yield was by 29% higher in Japan than that in the U.S.A. In the 2010 to 2014 period, however, there was practically no difference in the technology coefficient between Japan (<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> = 0.56) and the U.S.A. (<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> = 0.53), indicating that the rice production technologies in the U.S.A. had developed more rapidly than those in Japan in the past 30 years. This analysis implies that SIMRIW is not only an effective model in evaluating the climatic potential rice yield, but also in measuring rice production technologies while excluding the climate effects.</p><p>The potential yields evaluated by SIMRIW for Japan are close to the records of contest-winning yield of 12&#x02013;13 t ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (in paddy) in the late 1950s in Japan. Those yields are nearly twice the actual rice yields averaged over Japan for the recent years (about 6.7 t ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in paddy). Those high yields were achieved by growing the prevailing rice cultivars at that time under exclusively intensive crop and resource managements. SIMRIW evaluated very high potential yield for California under a moderate temperature and very high solar radiation. Under such climates, very high rice yields of 15&#x02013;16 t ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> were actually obtained in Nile Delta, Egypt<sup><xref rid="r118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>)</sup> and Taoyuan at high land of Yunnan, China,<sup><xref rid="r119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>)</sup> and that of above 13 t ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in New South Wales, Australia.<sup><xref rid="r120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>)</sup> SIMRIW evaluated that potential yields in the tropics were generally lower than those in temperate regions, but at maximum, three rice crops per year are possible in the tropics, so that annual rice yields are about two times as large as those in the temperate.<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)</sup> The large yield gap between the potential and the actual yields is shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6</xref>, which suggests that there are still large rooms to increase rice yield by the management.</p><p>It was shown that SIMRIW not only evaluates well the locational variation in rice yield, but also it simulates well the year-to-year yield variations of rice in various climatic regions in Japan,<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>)</sup> and seasonal variation of rice yield in Philippines,<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>)</sup> based on weather.</p><p>SIMRIW and its component modules have been widely utilized in diverse areas of rice production science and technologies.

The partitioning of sugar to those organs is calculated based on the principle that growth rate of an organ depends on the balance between sugar demand for growth and its availability from the sugar pool, in which the demand of panicles has the first priority. The sugar demand of an organ is determined by the size of the organ, Crop Developmental Index (<italic>DVI</italic>), plant N status and temperature. A supply of sugar to starch storage occurs when the size of sugar pool exceeds the total demand of all organs. The stored starch is utilized for the growth of panicles after the heading, for they have large sugar requirement for their growth which often exceeds the current daily photosynthesis.

The corresponding climate change at each weather station was estimated by interpolating the predicted change at surrounding grid points. The annual courses of daily maximum and minimum temperatures or daily solar radiation at a given weather station under doubled [CO<sub>2</sub>] conditions were synthesized by adding the temperature changes or by multiplying percentage radiation change to the observed daily maximum and minimum temperatures or solar radiation at the station, and used for the subsequent impact studies.</p></sec><sec><label>5.2</label><title>The effects on Japan.</title><sec><title>Climate data and crop parameters.</title><p>Weather data of daily maximum and minimum temperatures and daily solar radiation from nine weather stations (Sapporo, Akita, Sendai, Maebashi, Toyama, Nagoya, Hiroshima, Kochi, Miyazaki) for 12 years from 1979 to 1990 were used as base line for predicting potential effects of elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] and global warming on rice production by rice model SIMRIW. These weather stations are representing major Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZs) in Japan proposed by Ozawa.<sup><xref rid="r149" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>)</sup> From these data, the average climate for each location was synthesized by averaging daily weather values over the 12 years for each location and was used as the base climate.

Those are Ishikari for Hokkaido island, Sasanishiki for northern Honshu (Main Island), Koshihikari for central Honshu, Nipponbare for west Honshu and Shikoku island, and Mizuho for Kyushu island, respectively. The major difference in crop parameters among these cultivars exists in the parameters describing crop phenological development given by Eq.

For the parameter representing crop sensitivity to high temperature stress (<italic>T</italic><sub>50</sub>: the 50% spikelet sterility temperature), however, the values for Akihikari and Koshihikari determined for doubled [CO<sub>2</sub>] by the procedure described in the section 3.3 were employed for all the cultivars, because <italic>T</italic><sub>50</sub> values for other cultivars were unknown in the early 1990s. Furthermore, the <italic>T</italic><sub>50</sub> values determined for both cultivars under doubled [CO<sub>2</sub>] (36.6 &#x02103; for Akihikari and 38.2 &#x02103; for Koshihikari) were also applied for ambient [CO<sub>2</sub>] conditions, because it was unclear in the mid. 1990s that rice grown under ambient [CO<sub>2</sub>] has higher <italic>T</italic><sub>50</sub> than that under doubled [CO<sub>2</sub>].

Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref> shows relative changes in rice yield over Japan simulated for the sensitive (left) and the tolerant (right) cultivars to the heat stress, under GFDL climate scenario.<sup><xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>)</sup> It was predicted that the GFDL doubled [CO<sub>2</sub>] climate would give moderately positive effects on rice yield in northern Japan, and negative effects on south-central and southwestern Japan.<sup><xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>)</sup> Although the predicted effects of doubled [CO<sub>2</sub>] climate on rice yield in Japan were quantitatively different among climate scenarios of GFDL, GISS and UKMO, the direction of effects were similar.</p><p>The positive effects of doubled [CO<sub>2</sub>] and temperature rise in northern Japan were because the base temperature over there is relatively low or cool, under which conditions the direct effect of doubled [CO<sub>2</sub>] exceeded negative effects of shortened growth duration by the projected warming. The decrease in yield in the south-central and southwestern Japan were due to temperature rise predicted by GCMs being high enough not only to shorten rice growth duration but also to bring about extensive spikelet sterility. These results suggested that heat-induced spikelet sterility will become the serious problem for rice production in south-central and southwestern Japan under projected global warming climate.</p><p>The heat-induced spikelet sterility of rice had rarely occurred in Japan, but it was observed in south-central Japan in a hot summer year of 2007, under a warming trend in Japan from around 1990. In Tsukuba which is located in south-central Japan, cv. Koshihikari that headed during the period with 33&#x02013;39 &#x02103; daily maximum temperatures suffered 10&#x02013;24% spikelet sterility.<sup><xref rid="r61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>)</sup> If it had occurred under doubled [CO<sub>2</sub>], more extensive sterility and severe yield reductions would have been brought about, because elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] increased rice sensitivity to heat stress at flowering stage, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>. The observation of heat-induced spikelet sterility under the current climate condition in Japan suggests the reality of our predictions based on SIMRIW.</p><p>It was found that the genotypic difference in crop sensitivity to heat-induced spikelet sterility brought significantly large difference in the simulated yield change under doubled [CO<sub>2</sub>] climate, as is shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>. For high temperature sensitive genotypes, severe yield reductions by 17% in GFDL, 12% in GISS and 33% in UKMO climate from the present were predicted, respectively, on average over south-central and southwestern Japan. When high temperature tolerant genotype was adopted, those negative effects of doubled [CO<sub>2</sub>] climate decreased to less than 10% in GFDL and UKMO, or reversed into positive in GISS. Considering the difference in the heat stress sensitivity (<italic>T</italic><sub>50</sub>) between the sensitive (Akihikari) and tolerant (Koshihikari) genotype was only 1.6 &#x02103;, a slight difference in <italic>T</italic><sub>50</sub> between rice cultivars significantly affected the simulated rice yields under doubled [CO<sub>2</sub>] climate.<sup><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>)</sup> As more frequent hot and cold extreme temperatures are predicted by IPCC<sup><xref rid="r81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>)</sup> under global warming, further enhancement of rice tolerance to heat-induced spikelet sterility is the primarily important target for development of adaptive rice cultivars to anticipated global warming.</p><p>Another important point shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref> is that positive effect of doubled [CO<sub>2</sub>] climate on rice yield in Hokkaido was significantly smaller than that in Tohoku region (northern Honshu). This was because the cv. Ishikari grown in Hokkaido is a short growth duration genotype, owing to its insensitivity to photoperiod, for adapting to short growing season under the cool climate, to which projected global warming will accelerate crop development, thereby resulting in further shortened duration of growth. It will become possible, however, to grow a photoperiod sensitive and longer growth duration cultivar in Hokkaido under projected warming climate, by utilizing the benefit of extended rice growing season. A 50% yield increase was predicted for Hokkaido under doubled [CO<sub>2</sub>] climates, by growing cultivar Koshihikari, a much longer growth duration cultivar with advanced transplanting date.<sup><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>)</sup> The effects of altered cultivars and cropping seasons under doubled [CO<sub>2</sub>] climate were similarly simulated for other regions in Japan. The results showed that these adaptation measures will alleviate the negative effects and enlarge the positive effects of global warming to some extent, but not so large as in Hokkaido.<sup><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>)</sup> These results imply that global warming has a potential to largely increase the rice yield in northern limit area of rice culture, where the current cool temperatures have been limiting the growing season.</p><p>On the basis of the simulation study described above, we can conclude that the projected increase in [CO<sub>2</sub>] in the atmosphere and global warming will substantially increase rice yields in northern Japan, but in south-central and southwestern Japan, it will reduce the yield through spikelet sterility induced by higher temperatures at flowering stage.</p></sec><sec><title>Recent studies on the effects of global warming on rice production in Japan.</title><p>Since our studies in mid. 1990s on the impact evaluation of projected global warming on rice production, similar studies have actively been made in Japan by using SIMRIW with modified crop parameters, under various climate scenarios provided by many newly developed GCMs.<sup><xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="r135" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>)</sup> As those studies predicted rice yield change in Japan under different climate scenarios from ours, direct comparison of those predictions with ours is difficult. However, the yield changes predicted by them for late 21st century have generally agreed with our previous prediction that the projected increase in [CO<sub>2</sub>] and associated global warming will increase rice yield in northern Japan and decrease in south-central and southwestern Japan, although the degree of yield change varied depending on climate scenarios.</p><p>On the other hand, the trend of temperature increase, especially the minimum temperature, had become remarkable in Japan from the year 1990, whereby the adverse effects on rice quality became noticeable. It was found that mean temperature above 26&#x02013;27 &#x02103; during the 20-day period after heading caused an increase of chalky grain due to reduced supply of carbohydrates to rice grain.<sup><xref rid="r150" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>)</sup> Rice model GEMRICE had rationally simulated percentage of chalky grain, observed under field conditions, based on climate and dynamics in carbohydrates and nitrogen during grain filling period,<sup><xref rid="r151" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>)</sup> hence, suggesting the model applicability for the prediction of yield and grain quality. Also, a study was made<sup><xref rid="r55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>)</sup> to predict effects of climate change on rice yield and grain quality for various regions in Japan, under six GCM climate scenarios by three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) of greenhouse gases, using rice model H/H.<sup><xref rid="r152" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>)</sup> The result showed that rice yield over Japan will slightly increase under most climate scenarios, but risks of grain quality degradation will increase from year 2031 onwards in many regions.

Daily climate data were collected from 68 weather stations in 15 countries of Asia and compiled into rice-weather database. The number of years that the database covered was different among locations from only 2 to 32 years, but more than 10 years in majority of the locations. Two rice models of SIMRIW and ORYZA1<sup><xref rid="r136" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>)</sup> were used for the impact evaluation. The ORYZA1 is a more physiology-based process model than SIMRIW, which is simulating the rice growth based on single leaf photosynthesis as a function of solar radiation, temperature, [CO<sub>2</sub>] and nitrogen (N) content of leaves, by a similar way as described for GEMRICE. It utilized the same module as that of SIMRIW for simulating the effects of high and cool temperatures on spikelet sterility of rice.</p><p>Both models adopted the crop parameters on cv.

Relative yield change from the present for each climate scenario at each location was obtained by averaging the yearly relative yield changes over all years.<sup><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>)</sup> In those regions where double or triple cropping of rice is practiced in the tropics, the simulations were done for double and triple crops, by using prevailing cropping seasons in the respective regions.</p></sec><sec><title>The predicted yield change in Asia.</title><p>The relative yield changes, predicted by SIMRIW under GFDL, GISS and UKMO climate scenarios for all the regions in Asia are shown in Table <xref rid="tbl01" ref-type="table">1</xref>,<sup><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>)</sup> following the Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZs) of FAO.<sup><xref rid="r153" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>)</sup> The predicted yield change under doubled [CO<sub>2</sub>] climate largely varied among the regions and climate scenarios employed. In general, UKMO climate was observed likely to give the most unfavorable effects on rice production across Asia, GISS to give intermediate and GFDL the mildest effects. This is consistent with the predictions by ORYZA1. It was predicted that rice yields in the regions surrounding the equator (Indonesia and Malaysia) will increase under all climate scenarios of GFDL, GISS and UKMO. This agreed well with the prediction by ORYZA1. The yield increase predicted by SIMRIW for these two countries ranged from 5.9% to 26.8%, depending on GCM climate scenarios. The positive effects of doubled [CO<sub>2</sub>] climate on rice yield in these regions was due to the present mean temperatures in the hottest months being less than 30 &#x02103;, and also to GCMs predicting smaller temperature increase in the south than in the north on the earth, although annual mean temperatures are high in these regions. Under such a climate, positive effects of elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] were likely to exceed negative effects of increased temperatures.</p><p>The regions where more than 10% yield reduction were predicted by SIMRIW under more than two GCM climate scenarios were AEZ 1 and 6 in India and AEZ 6 in China. In India, the AEZ 1 is located in south India including Tamil Nadu state, and AEZ 6 in northwest India including Punjab and Uttarakhand states, where daily maximum temperature in May and June often exceeds 40 &#x02103; under the current climate. The AEZ 6 in China is located in central China including those provinces of Hunan and Hubei, where daily maximum temperature in July and August occasionally exceeds 40 &#x02103; under the current climate. In those regions, considerable amount of spikelet sterility due to heat stress at flowering period were predicted under GISS and UKMO climate scenarios. These predictions by SIMRIW for AEZ 1 in India and AEZ 6 in China agree well with the prediction by ORYZA1, but that for AEZ 6 in India has not been authenticated. While SIMRIW predicted extensive spikelet sterility due to heat stress for AEZ 6, ORYZA1 did less severe spikelet sterility. As the two rice models used same module for simulating spikelet sterility, the disagreement was likely to be affected by the difference in the simulated heading date between the two models, and also by the limited number of years for weather data (only 3 years) for this region. Under such a circumstance, a difference in the heading date might differentiate the fate of rice panicles whether their headings encounter heat stress period or escape from it. More studies including on-site investigation are necessary on heat-induced spikelet sterility in AEZ 6 in India.</p><p>Recently, impact assessment studies of projected global climate change on rice production have actively been made in India and China, using various climate scenarios and rice models.

In this area of Thailand, rain-fed rice culture is mainly practiced in rainy season from June to September using traditional cultivars having high photoperiod sensitivity, but irrigated rice culture is also practiced partly, where rice is usually double cropped using modern high-yielding cultivars similar to IR36 for the second crop.

Namely, rice cultures in southeast India (AEZ 1), northwest India (AEZ 6), continent of Southeast Asia (AEZ 2), central China (AEZ 6) and south-central to southwestern Japan are likely to suffer significant yield reductions by the projected global warming, mainly through increased spikelet sterility and shortened growth duration, unless effective adaptation measures are developed.</p><p>In conclusion, the projected doubling [CO<sub>2</sub>] and associated global warming will substantially increase the yields of wet and single season rice in most Asian regions due to [CO<sub>2</sub>] fertilizing effects, but reduce the yields in the regions as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">12</xref>, mainly due to heat stress at flowering stage. Further, enhancement of rice tolerance to and/or escape from the heat-induced spikelet sterility is the key for the adaptation of rice culture in those high risk regions to projected global warming.

For the sake of simplicity, the heat-induced spikelet sterility was modeled in SIMRIW only by one variable of averaged daily maximum temperature over flowering period (<italic>T</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub>) as a temperature index (does not necessarily mean flowering time temperature) and one genetic parameter <italic>T</italic><sub>50</sub>.

Further, higher N use efficiency of genotypes was significantly correlated with panicle morphological traits of larger number of secondly rachis-branch differentiated on a primary rachis-branch, and with larger number of spikelet on a secondary rachis-branch.<sup><xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>)</sup> A gene was identified that increases spikelet number per panicle through accumulation of cytokinin in inflorescence meristems in rice by Ashikari <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="r174" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>)</sup></p><p>Further investigation was made for other plant traits associated with high yielding potential under ambient [CO<sub>2</sub>], and revealed that high yielding cultivars also had higher leaf photosynthetic rate, which in turn was associated with higher stomatal conductance and leaf N content.<sup><xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="r175" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>)</sup> Using RDRS, we explored rice genetic resources for the two important traits of high stomatal conductance and high leaf N, and identified Tupa729 (<italic>japonica</italic> from Bangladesh), Keiboba (non-<italic>aus</italic> type <italic>indica</italic> from China) and Shoni (<italic>aus</italic> type <italic>indica</italic> from Bangladesh) for high stomatal conductance, and Rexmont (<italic>japonica</italic>, from U.S.A.), Urasan1 (<italic>japonica</italic>, from Japan) and Padi Kuning (non-<italic>aus</italic> type <italic>indica</italic> from Indonesia) for high leaf N content.<sup><xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>)</sup></p><p>As shown above, useful gene sources for the traits associated with high yields under elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] were identified in diversely different rice genotypes over the world.

In concluding this review, the author would like to point out further research needs, focusing on the three areas: the measurement of temperature and [CO<sub>2</sub>] effects on rice, modeling the growth and yield responses of rice to projected global warming, and the research towards development of genotypes adaptive to global warming under increasing rice demand.</p><sec><label>7.1</label><title>More measurements of rice responses to high temperatures and [CO<sub>2</sub>].</title><p>Recent studies indicated that heat-induced sterility is not only affected by air temperature but also by air humidity through its transpirational cooling effects on panicles.<sup><xref rid="r64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="r161" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>)</sup> It is well accepted that panicle temperature can be remarkably lowered than the air temperature under hot and extremely dry conditions, which may alleviate heat induced spikelet sterility. On the other hand, as discussed in the section 6.2, there are some reports suggesting negative effects of high water-vapor pressure deficit of air on spikelet sterility, through desiccation of floral organs. Therefore, more research is necessary on the direct (desiccation) and indirect (transpirational cooling) effects of high vapor pressure deficit on rice spikelet sterility at flowering stage, in order to form basis for a more general model for predicting heat-induced spikelet sterility.</p><p>New experiment system FACE, that enabled to observe elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] effects on rice under field conditions, indicated lower responses of rice to elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>], in biomass production and yield, than those observed in growth chambers. Further studies are needed for clarifying the mechanism that caused this quantitative difference between FACE and other enclosure experiments like TGC, including the research on the effects of largely fluctuating [CO<sub>2</sub>] in FACE on crop physiology, growth and yield.</p><p>However, most important research needs exist in scarcity of measurement on interacting effects of increased temperature and [CO<sub>2</sub>] on rice, that is the central issue on global warming and rice production. Measurements suggesting the interacting effect of temperature and [CO<sub>2</sub>] on heat-induced spikelet sterility are limited to those of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref><sup><xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>)</sup> and other reports<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>)</sup> of nearly 20 years ago, despite it has potential effects more than offsetting the positive effects of elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] on rice. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref> implies that heat-induced spikelet sterility, which is observed on not a few occasions under the current climate in hot areas, would occur more frequently and severely under elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>]. More research is necessary on the interacting effects of high temperature and elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] on the spikelet sterility and on other growth and yield formation processes.</p></sec><sec><label>7.2</label><title>Increasing the certainty of rice model.</title><p>In the mid. 1990s, when we evaluated the climate change effects on rice production in Asia, the General Circulation Models (GCMs) were limited to those of GISS, GFDL and UKMO, and the rice models to those of SIMRIW (Horie, 1987),<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)</sup> CERES-Rice (Singh <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993)<sup><xref rid="r177" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>)</sup> and ORYZA1 (Kropff <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995).<sup><xref rid="r136" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>)</sup> Since then, various kinds of GCMs and rice models have been developed, and now are recognized as 42 GCMs<sup><xref rid="r81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>)</sup> and 16 rice models.<sup><xref rid="r88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>)</sup> Using various climate scenarios provided by diverse GCMs and many rice models, a large number of studies have been made to predict the effects of projected climate change on rice production in various regions of Asia, as already discussed in the previous sections. The situations are similar in other crops as in wheat, maize and soybean and large variations are recognized in the projected future crop productions under projected climate change, depending on climate scenarios and crop models.<sup><xref rid="r178" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>)</sup> Further, it was indicated that there are large uncertainties in crop yields predicted by different crop models for same environment conditions.<sup><xref rid="r88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>,<xref rid="r178" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>)</sup> Therefore, increasing the certainty of rice models is the important subject of further studies, for better understanding of the projected climate change effects on rice production in Asia.</p><p>As far as the author&#x02019;s reviews are concerned, there are two causes that are considered for the uncertainty of rice models: inadequacy in modeling the important process of yield determination, and insufficiency in model calibration and validations. It was suggested that inadequacy in modeling leaf area development caused large difference in the simulated biomass yield of rice.<sup><xref rid="r88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>)</sup> It was also suggested that inadequacy in the model description of heat-induced spikelet sterility caused a large variation in simulated rice yields,<sup><xref rid="r176" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>)</sup> and that many crop models did not even account for the stress temperature effects on the yield.<sup><xref rid="r179" ref-type="bibr">179</xref>)</sup> Since the heat-induced spikelet sterility gives critical effects on rice yield and there is a large genetic variability in the heat stress sensitivity of spikelet at flowering stage,<sup><xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="r60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="r98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>,<xref rid="r99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>)</sup> this process should adequately be modeled with explicit genetic parameters for the spikelet sensitivity to heat, as in <italic>T</italic><sub>50</sub> in SIMRIW.</p><p>The insufficiency in model calibration and validation could be seen in many modeling studies, in which model calibrations and validations were made against limited number of data sets obtained under narrow range of environments, despite the models that contained more than 20 empirical parameters. Model calibration is required to be conducted against sufficiently larger number of datasets than the number of empirical parameters. Further, model calibration and validation should be done for each process, independently of other process, to avoid multi-collinearity of parameters, by inputting measured data for the variables that are the outputs from other processes. Some studies calibrated SIMRIW against yearly changes of actual regional yield to modify the parameters built in the model.<sup><xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>)</sup> This needs to be done very carefully, however, because the actual yield variations generally include those effects of damages by insects, diseases, typhoons and floods, and crop managements, which SIMRIW does not account for. Since SIMRIW is a model to predict the potential rice yield that is determined by rice physiology and climate, but not the actual yield, such calibrations might impose those non-climate effects on physiological parameters, which might reduce model generality and applicability to unprecedented environments of global warming.</p><p>Calibrations of the model for simulating climate change effects on rice should be done against sufficient numbers of data-sets from well-managed field experiments that cover wide range of environment as in ARICENET and from temperature by [CO<sub>2</sub>] treatment experiments as in TGC. However, accumulations of such data-sets are scarcely seen in this 20-year period, except those from FACE only on [CO<sub>2</sub>] effects on rice, so that the situation is &#x02018;so many models, but so few measurements&#x02019;. Clearly, more experiments and measurements are necessary. Also, crop models need to be more objective oriented and simple structured, with minimum numbers of empirical parameters, because number of empirical parameters increase with the increase in model complexity, which not only makes it difficult to obtain necessary data for setting parameters, but also it may limit model applicability beyond the environments under which the data were obtained.</p><p>Model development in tandem with measurements is required for the development of this newly emerged science in the right way.</p></sec><sec><label>7.3</label><title>Development of adaptive rice genotypes to global warming.</title><p>The most remarkable progress in this area is seen in the development of near isogenic lines of <italic>indica</italic> and <italic>japonica</italic> cultivars that have early flowering traits for escaping from heat-induced spikelet sterility.<sup><xref rid="r66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="r171" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>)</sup> Further investigation is required for testing the effectiveness of these near isogenic lines under field conditions in heat-stress-prone areas in Asia. Development of heat-stress-tolerant cultivar is also important to ensure stable rice productions under global warming, for it is yet uncertain if early flowering trait alone could minimize the predicted heat-induced spikelet sterility under global warming. Significant progress is also seen in the studies on heat stress tolerance: the clarification of the mechanism for heat-stress tolerance,<sup><xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="r57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>)</sup> the identification of the length of basal dehiscence of anther as a genetic trait for the tolerance,<sup><xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="r60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>)</sup> and the identification of QTLs for controlling the dehiscence length.<sup><xref rid="r65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="r69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>)</sup> Further study is needed towards development of heat-stress-tolerant genotypes using those QTLs identified, while exploring for other traits that may also be associated with the heat-stress tolerance.</p><p>Significant progress is also seen in the research towards development of high yielding cultivars under elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>]. It was indicated that three genetic traits were associated with high yielding rice under elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>]: the high N use efficiency in spikelet production, the high stomatal conductance and the high leaf N content.<sup><xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="r175" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>)</sup> Further, genetic resources for each of these traits were identified from the investigation over a wide range of rice germplasms.<sup><xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="r140" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>)</sup> It is important to identify from the genetic resources, the genes that control these traits, and, by integrating the identified genes in a plant, to develop cultivars that have high yield potential under elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>]. These studies are highly requested for ensuring food security in Asia, under increasing population and projected global warming.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>I would like to express my sincere appreciations to Dr. Koichiro Tsunewaki, Prof. Emeritus of Kyoto University and member of Japan Academy, for encouraging me to write this article to Proceedings of the Japan Academy, Series B.</p><p>This review is mainly based on the series of collaborative studies on climate change and rice, conducted at Laboratory of Crop Science, Kyoto University.

He worked as a researcher for National Institute of Agricultural Sciences (1965&#x02013;1983), a senior researcher for National Institute of Agro-Environmental Sciences (1983&#x02013;1984), and the head of Laboratory of Agricultural Meteorology for Hokuriku National Agricultural Experimental Station (1984&#x02013;1985). He received his doctor's degree from Kyoto University in 1981.</p><p>He worked as a professor at Faculty of Agriculture (1985&#x02013;1997) and Graduate School of Agriculture (1997&#x02013;2006) of Kyoto University. He conducted researches on measurements and modeling of crop responses to environments throughout his career and developed a dynamic model to predict rice growth and yield based on environments. He clarified potential effects of the projected climate change on rice production in Asia by using the model and identified rice physiological and morphological traits required for breeding of rice genotypes adaptive to climate change. He became the president of National Agriculture and Food Research Organization of Japan, and steered the development and conduction of many national research projects for technology developments for agriculture and food industries (2006&#x02013;2014). He also contributed to international agriculture research as a member of the Board of Trustees for the Africa Rice Center (2001&#x02013;2006) and the Independent Science Panel for the International Research Program: Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (2012&#x02013;2014). Due to these significant contributions, he was awarded the prize of the Society of Agricultural Meteorology of Japan in 1986, the Japan Prize of Agriculture Science in 1999, the Nippon Agricultural Research Institute Prize in 2016 and the Japan Academy Prize in 2018.<graphic xlink:href="pjab-95-211-p001.gif" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></p></bio></back><floats-group><fig id="fig01" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1. </label><caption><p>Rice percentage of total grain production in each country, and amount of annual rice production of major rice producing countries in the world in 2010.<sup><xref rid="r80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>)</sup> Mt indicates 10<sup>9</sup> kg.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pjab-95-211-g001"/></fig><fig id="fig02" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2. </label><caption><p>Schematic drawing of the Temperature Gradient Chamber (TGC) of [CO<sub>2</sub>] enrichment type (bottom) and ambient [CO<sub>2</sub>] type (top) developed for rice at Kyoto, Japan.<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>)</sup> The numbers indicate, 1, oil heater; 2, stovepipe of oil heater; 3, air exhaust window; 4, variable speed exhaust fan; 5, reversible exhaust fan; 6, oscillating fan; 7, [CO<sub>2</sub>] controller; 8, CO<sub>2</sub> mixing and injection pipe; 9, liquid CO<sub>2</sub> tanks.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pjab-95-211-g002"/></fig><fig id="fig03" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3. </label><caption><p>Total crop (&#x025cf;, &#x025cb;) and panicle (&#x025a0;, &#x025a1;) dry weight of rice (cv.
