How often such events occur in a warmer world is however less well established, and the combined effect of changes in frequency and intensity on the total amount of rain falling as extreme precipitation is much less explored, in spite of potentially large societal impacts. Here, we employ observations and climate model simulations to document strong increases in the frequencies of extreme precipitation events occurring on decadal timescales. Based on observations we find that the total precipitation from these intense events almost doubles per degree of warming, mainly due to changes in frequency, while the intensity changes are relatively weak, in accordance to previous studies. This shift towards stronger total precipitation from extreme events is seen in observations and climate models, and increases with the strength &#x02013; and hence the rareness &#x02013; of the event. Based on these results, we project that if historical trends continue, the most intense precipitation events observed today are likely to almost double in occurrence for each degree of further global warming. Changes to extreme precipitation of this magnitude are dramatically stronger than the more widely communicated changes to global mean precipitation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Climate sciences</kwd><kwd>Environmental social sciences</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">It is well established that the intensity of extreme precipitation increases more strongly with global mean surface temperature than mean precipitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, as the latter, on a global scale, is limited by energy constraints<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.

When investigating the heaviest precipitation events (occurring seldom) we therefore create indices for R99.95p<sub>all</sub> and R99.97p<sub>all</sub>, and include all days in the analysis. Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> shows the relationship between our various indices, for wet days and all days over Europe. From these defined indices, we can quantify the total precipitation change above a certain percentile (e.g. 99<sup>th</sup> or 99.97<sup>th</sup> percentiles) and then go on to investigate the contributions from changes in frequency and intensity separately. The frequency change is simply the change in number of events with precipitation above the fixed threshold obtained for the reference period for a given percentile, while the change in intensity is calculated from the precipitation amount above the percentile in question (see Methods). In addition, for consistency with other studies, we include the common climate index Rx1day. Rx1day is defined as the annual maximum daily precipitation, and is close to the 99.7<sup>th</sup> percentile applied for all days. The spatial pattern of Rx1day change shows an overall increase over all continents over the historical era<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and has been investigated in several earlier studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par9">We use measurements from individual meteorological stations over some selected regions, as well as gridded precipitation products over Europe, USA, Japan and Australia.

The observations are analysed for one recent and one reference period of approximately 30 years using time series going backward in time as far as allowed by observational records (see Methods). In addition to observational data, we use results from several global coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.

We find a strong observed increase in extreme precipitation frequency per degree warming, and with a magnitude that increases monotonically with the &#x0201c;extremeness&#x0201d; of the chosen threshold percentile &#x02013; or, equivalently, with the rareness of the event. For instance, for R99p, the observed changes in frequency and intensity are 60% K<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 11% K<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively, but reach 100% K<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 13% K<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for R99.97p<sub>all</sub>. Observed increases in frequency and intensity are generally larger over Europe and Japan than over USA and Australia (see Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Furthermore, Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> shows that results using the standard definition of R99p, including only wet days, differ from extreme indices using all days. This is consistent with our results, since 1% of all days is a less strict selection threshold compared to 1% of wet days. The increase in frequency is also consistent with previous results using the same observational data set over Europe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> given that our results are normalized by temperature change and shown here at more extreme percentiles.

However, the intensity increase is clearly also of importance. For one third of the grid points, the change in the total amount of rainfall in extreme events (R99p) is at least 20% greater than expected from changes in frequency alone. The global climate models also show strong increases in the intensity and frequency for the considered extreme indices (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a,b</xref>) but these increases are smaller than in the observations, which is consistent with earlier findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.

Each of the models shows a similarly patchy pattern in the change of the total extreme precipitation as the observations (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). However, the mean of the 16 models (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>) shows a more robust estimate of the underlying forced response and thus a rather homogeneous pattern relative to the individual models. Part of the changes in southern-Europe may be influenced by changes in dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Illustrating the precipitation changes as PDFs, the observed changes have a width and shape similar to the individual models, but the PDF of the multi-model mean is narrower (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). Using even longer time series of 50 years further increases the homogeneity of the multi-model mean changes (as shown for future changes in Supplementary Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>), but large inhomogeneous patterns can still be seen for each of the individual models. In the future, extreme precipitation will still be heavily influenced by local natural variability, so that at individual stations or in smaller regions the signal will be small compared to the variability. Therefore, it is necessary to aggregate measurements from larger regions in order to detect changes in extreme precipitation, as done earlier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and in the present study, or to use statistical methods for deriving long-term trends<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. It is particularly worth noticing that only a few of the models capture the very strong observed changes (more than 100% K<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Regional distribution of the change in R99p over Europe from E-OBS between the two periods 1951&#x02013;1980 and 1984&#x02013;2013 (<bold>a</bold>), mean of 16 CMIP5 models 1951&#x02013;1980 and 1984&#x02013;2013 (<bold>b</bold>), PDFs of 16 individual CMIP5 models, their model-mean PDF and observations (<bold>c</bold>), PDF of observed R99p for two time periods (<bold>d</bold>), PDF of model simulated R99p for historical, present, and future (2071&#x02013;2100) (<bold>e</bold>).

The shift of the PDF is particularly strong for the most extreme events taking place in regions with historically high R99p, whereas for the observations there is a small reduction in R99p in regions of low extreme precipitation. In the observations, the PDF therefore widens for the recent period compared to the reference period, whereas for the multi-model mean the PDFs mostly have a more similar shape. The future R99p changes under the high greenhouse gas emission scenario are much larger than in the historical simulations, consistent with their much larger surface temperature changes. Overall, the shift in the PDF towards higher values of total precipitation from extreme events is clearly seen in both observations and climate models.</p><p id="Par16">Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> shows the mean frequency of precipitation events above the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile over Europe, for historical and future simulations (1900&#x02013;2100), including individual CMIP5 models and the multi-model mean. Here, 1900&#x02013;1930 is used as a reference period. Per definition the mean frequency during 1900&#x02013;1930 for R99p<sub>all</sub> is 3.65 (1% of the days in a year) with the models showing some interannual variability with a regional mean from 2 to 5 events per year. The model diversity in precipitation frequency is large during the 21<sup>st</sup> century, with a multi-model mean around 6 events at the end of the century. A major driver of model diversity in the change in frequency between the end of the century and 1900&#x02013;1930, is the fact that models have different surface temperature changes dominated by differences in the climate sensitivities. Models that have the strongest (weakest) increase in frequency also have the strongest (weakest) surface temperature increase. The change in frequency follows the change in surface temperature between various 30-year periods to within 1% for the multi model mean (not shown).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>European regional mean frequency of daily 99<sup>th</sup> percentile of precipitation simulated by CMIP5 models for historical and future conditions (1900&#x02013;2100).

These results are generally consistent with the assessments in IPCC AR5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, but with stronger mean observed changes. However, the increase in total precipitation from extreme events such as the 1% heaviest rainfall (R99p, yellow) and events occurring on average about once per decade (R99.97p<sub>all,</sub> orange) in the control period, is several times larger than the intensity increase discussed in IPCC AR5. These increases reach 59% K<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 96% K<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively, in the observations, which is five and ten times larger than the intensity increases alone.

Whether the stronger observed increase over Europe and Japan is driven by large natural variability, different regimes for extreme precipitation, artefacts in the measurements or other factors are unclear.

The duration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> and area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> of the extreme precipitation events may also be affected by climate change. We have shown here that extreme precipitation events occurring on average twice per decade will increase in frequency by 1&#x02013;2 events per decade per degree of warming. Thus, for a 2&#x02009;K global mean surface warming, the frequency of these events would double or triple. Further, observations indicate that the total precipitation from extreme events occurring once per decade may increase on the order of 10 times more than when considering intensity increases alone. Changes in all aspects of heavy precipitation are vital to society, for instance when it comes to constructing sufficiently resilient infrastructure. Traditionally, infrastructure design is based on Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves but they assume a constant climate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Unsurprisingly, this has been shown to underestimate the effect of extreme precipitation on infrastructure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. There is therefore a strong need to update infrastructure design strategies in a way that climate change is taken into account, especially since changes in intensity and frequency of precipitation extremes have already been detected in some regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, meaning that existing infrastructure is already ill-adapted. Updated IDF curves for the US using CMIP5 simulations show similar results, i.e. a 20% increase in intense precipitation events that occur twice as often in some highly populated regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> and recently the importance of changes in temporal patterns of heavy precipitation events on urban and suburban flooding has been highlighted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Changes in the frequency of extreme precipitation events is therefore highly relevant, especially where the resilience of existing infrastructure is already exceeded.</p><p id="Par19">Here we highlight the fact that total changes in extreme precipitation are a result of combined changes in both intensity and frequency. A main result from this study is that there is a strong monotonic strengthening of frequency increase and thereby relative increase in total extreme precipitation with rareness of the precipitation events. We argue that the impact of extreme precipitation on society results from both the number of events above the present tolerance and the severity of these events, and hence indices used to indicate impacts of climate change should encompass both. These increases are much higher than found in studies of precipitation intensity alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, including the IPCC 5<sup>th</sup> Assessment Report. Such large increases are not taken into account by adaptation management, and our findings imply that society may not be adequately prepared for the coming changes in extreme rainfall.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Calculation of extreme indices</title><p id="Par20">The extreme precipitation indices are calculated as follows. For R99p, we consider wet days only and find the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile of daily precipitation events in the reference period for each individual observational or model grid point. This threshold is then used for both the reference and the latest period and R99p is calculated as the sum of the precipitation during all events exceeding the threshold. We then area-average the results from each period and calculate the change in R99p for the given region. In this study we use the first 30-year period as a reference period and find the percentiles from these data. This choice of reference period has little effect on the resulting change in R99p, as can be seen in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. For R99.95p<sub>all</sub> and R99.97p<sub>all</sub>, the same method is applied, except all days (not only days with precipitation above 1&#x02009;mm) are included when calculating the reference period 99.95<sup>th</sup> and 99.97<sup>th</sup> percentiles. These latter precipitation indices provide more extreme events compared to R99p and they occur on average only about every fifth and tenth year, respectively. The mathematical expression for R99p is given at the following web site along with 26 other key climate extreme indices (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://etccdi.pacificclimate.org/list_27_indices.shtml">http://etccdi.pacificclimate.org/list_27_indices.shtml</ext-link>) and the historical development of these climate extreme indices have been described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. R99.97p<sub>all</sub> has the same expression as R99p except that the summation is over all days instead of only wet days and the 99.97<sup>th</sup> percentile is applied instead of the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> compares climate indices for wet and all days. For R99.97<sub>all</sub> it will be 4 events at every location for the reference period and a change in total precipitation can be either due to the stronger intensity, increase in the frequency or a combination of the two. The frequency change is calculated as the change in number of precipitation events above the threshold given by the reference period. The change in intensity is calculated as the total precipitation in the events above the percentile in the reference period and the strongest equal number of events in the recent/future period. Note that the change in total, intensity and frequency are calculated independently. To scale the observed changes we use global and annual mean temperatures from NASA GISS data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/">https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> to derive units of %/K.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Observational data</title><p id="Par21">There are several limitations in the measurement data available for extreme precipitation analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.
