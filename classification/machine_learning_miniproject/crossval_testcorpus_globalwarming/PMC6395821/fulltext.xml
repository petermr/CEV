Such costs increase in warm conditions, when endotherms may trade food intake for cooler areas&#x000a0;to avoid heat stress and maximize their energy balance. The need to reduce heat stress may involve the adoption of tactics affecting space use and foraging behaviour, which are important to understand and predict the effects of climate change and inform conservation. We used resource selection models to examine the behavioural response to heat stress in the Alpine ibex (<italic>Capra ibex</italic>), a cold-adapted endotherm particularly prone to overheating. Ibex avoided heat stress by selecting the&#x000a0;space based on the maximum daily temperature rather than moving hourly to &#x02018;surf the heat wave&#x02019;, which minimised movement costs but prevented optimal foraging. By integrating these findings with new climate forecasts, we predict that rising temperatures will force mountain ungulates to move upward and overcrowd thermal refugia with reduced carrying capacity. Our approach helps in identifying priority areas for the conservation of mountain species.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Global temperatures are increasing at unprecedented rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> which may alter selective pressures on animal populations given that thermal balance profoundly affects animal behaviour and population dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Temperature can affect the behaviour of endotherms by influencing the quality, distribution and phenology of resources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. When combined with solar radiation and wind speed, temperature can affect the spatiotemporal variation of the thermal environment experienced by animals (i.e., the operative temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>). When the ambient temperature exceeds body temperature, endotherms rely on thermoregulation to avoid lethal heat stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Thermoregulation accounts indeed for a large portion of the energy spent by endotherms when they cope with warmer conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. As a result, the trade-offs in energy allocation by endothermic organisms are expected to be driven more by their ability to dissipate heat and avoid hyperthermia than by their ability to harvest energy from the environment, as predicted by the heat dissipation limit theory (HDLT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>).</p><p id="Par3">Behavioural responses to heat stress can strongly influence spatial distribution of heat-sensitive species facing a warmer climate. Endotherms may buffer themselves against extreme operative temperatures by actively selecting for thermal refuge areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. They can select for woody cover<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and move to shaded areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, they can prefer open areas on windy days to increase convective cooling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, or even rest against tree trunks to enhance conductive heat loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. These tactics can reduce thermoregulation costs and increase endotherm ability to allocate energy to other vital processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Quantifying the degree to which large herbivores select thermoregulation low-cost areas rather than those where the access to food is higher is a major challenge for ecologists. This trade-off may negatively affect individual fitness as the climate progressively warms. A better understanding of this ecological process should be a priority for species forecasted to be particularly affected by climate change and to define <italic>ad hoc</italic> conservation actions, which include the need to gather fine-scale empirical data, and predict how heat-sensitive species would respond to the new challenges imposed by global warming.</p><p id="Par4">Here, we first combined unique fine-scale data describing spatiotemporal variation in temperature with direct observations of a large cold-adapted endotherm, the Alpine ibex (<italic>Capra ibex</italic>). We then built high-resolution resource selection models to investigate how thermal constraints affect ibex selection of feeding patches during foraging activities. We finally combined our models describing the behaviour of this mountain ungulate with climate change scenarios to predict the response of the species to the increasing temperatures forecasted for the next decades. Alpine ibex is a mountain ungulate that evolved and adapted well to the extreme alpine winter temperatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. These adaptations limit the ibex&#x02019;s ability to dissipate heat and make them prone to overheating. This is particularly the case for males which, weighing twice as much as females, have a lower surface-body mass ratio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Ibex typically cope with high temperatures through behavioural thermoregulation, which entails a reduction of their overall activity and moving to higher elevation, where vegetation quality may be lower<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. A detailed picture of causes and consequences of behavioural responses of mountain ungulates to rising temperatures remains missing and thus limits our ability to understand and predict the consequences of climate change.</p><p id="Par5">We examined resource selection by male ibex in the hours when they are more likely to forage, from early spring to autumn, that is the critical period when they experience the highest environmental temperatures and must acquire energy prior to the rigors of winter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. We <italic>a priori</italic> formulated the following predictions:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par6">Avoidance of higher operative temperatures (i.e., thermal environment experienced by animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>) is expected to strongly influence resource selection by ibex, even outweighing food intake in importance. Therefore, when air temperature and solar radiation increase and the thermoregulation becomes critical, ibex are predicted to trade best-food patches for cooler areas where they can minimize radiant heat load.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par7">Wind increases convective heat loss, thus improving the animals&#x02019; thermal balance in hot conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Hence, ibex are predicted to select windy slopes to a greater extent in order to facilitate thermoregulation.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par8">Because locomotion is costly and increases metabolic heat production, it should be advantageous to select areas where the overall conditions would be optimal during the hottest hours, rather than moving hourly to &#x02018;surf the heat wave&#x02019; and reach cooler areas at upper elevation as the temperature increases during the day. We thus formulate two alternative predictions: (3A) ibex select foraging areas according to maximum daily temperature &#x02013; that is, they are located where conditions would be optimal when the maximum temperature is recorded; (3B) ibex select foraging areas according to their actual hourly temperature&#x02013;that is, they are more likely to be located where the conditions are optimal over the short time period (surfing the heat wave).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par9">The increasingly warmer summer days forecasted by climate change scenarios may lead ibex to select cooler areas at increasingly higher altitudes. Thus, by combining resource selection models with future climate projections specific of the mountain range occupied by our target species, we predicted a contraction of the extension of ibex suitable area under climate change scenarios. More importantly, the aim of this approach is to characterize and quantify such hotspots that are forecasted to be key for the survival of the species in the region. These hotspots should be targeted by conservation and management actions, and the same approach should be used for the protection of wildlife in mountain ranges, prioritizing those species expected to be particularly hit by global warming.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ibex resource selection: maximum daily temperature is a better predictor than hourly temperature</title><p id="Par10">The large-scale resource selection model including maximum daily temperature as predictor (parameter estimates reported in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) outperformed the alternative model including hourly temperature (Akaike Information Criterion difference: &#x00394;AIC&#x02009;=&#x02009;273.76).

When air temperatures increased, and thermoregulation became critical, ibex traded best food patches for cooler areas (prediction 1). Solar radiation was overtaken in importance by other predictors and excluded by the list of candidate drivers of resource selection in ibex. Contrary to our prediction 2, ibex did not select windy slopes to a greater extent to facilitate heat loss and improve thermal balance. Male ibex spatial behaviour was primarily driven by maximum daily temperatures rather than by those recorded hourly (prediction 3A). This suggests that a heat-sensitive species may cope with warmer temperatures by selecting the space based on where the highest daily temperature is going to be recorded rather than moving hourly to &#x02018;surf (or rather anticipate) the heat wave&#x02019;. On the one hand, ibex had the chance to move upward by anticipating the heat wave moving up from the bottom of the valley as the day progresses, with the option to move downward in the late afternoon. On the other hand, male ibex had the chance to reduce their overall movement rate and occupy a spot where overheating would be reduced when maximum temperatures are reached. Male ibex adopted the latter strategy. Our models are the first to forecast at unprecedented high-resolution how ibex will respond to global warming &#x02013; namely by retreating to and concentrating in fewer locations at higher elevation (prediction 4).</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Resource selection during foraging activity</title><p id="Par22">Ibex spent their daily foraging time at the same elevation, which was selected based on the daily maximum temperatures reached there during the central (and hottest) part of the day. In other words, ibex can anticipate hours in advance which locations will have the most favourable temperatures later in the day. As locomotion entails energy expenditure and increases metabolic heat production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, animals may achieve a better energy balance by reducing movements and selecting areas where temperatures remain under the critical threshold during the most part of the day, rather than moving continuously to find the best thermal conditions at each moment of the day. How ibex could determine their optimal position in the early morning when the maximum temperature was yet to be experienced is not clear. We argue that ibex can sense temperature trends in advance in the morning by decoding environmental cues. Studies on a variety of taxa, from insects to mammals, showed that animals are able to use environmental cues to predict near-term weather, so as to time their behavioural decisions ahead of impending changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Some species, for instance, can detect approaching storms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> through barometric pressure. Temperature predictive skills, however, have not been documented in animal species so far. The ability to predict temperature trends - which our study seems to suggest - would be beneficial to species relying on behavioural thermoregulation, because it may help animals to optimize their behavioural decisions (e.g., lowering the costs of locomotion) and to daily select the best pastures where maximum heat stress is tolerable.</p><p id="Par23">The most important driver of resource selection by male ibex was the trade-off between food quality and maximum temperatures. Male ibex selected areas with higher NDVI values whenever maximum temperature was low, and they moved to areas characterised by lower NDVI values when maximum temperature increased. This trade-off was already hypothesised by Mason <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, who analysed time budget data and showed that ibex may respond to variation in seasonal temperatures by migrating towards higher altitudes, where they used areas of lower forage quality. Our spatially-explicit fine-scale analysis clarifies the mechanisms underlying the seasonal movement of male ibex towards higher altitudes and disentangles for the first time the behavioural response of this heat-sensitive species to warmer temperatures. Our study adds significant pieces to the complex puzzle depicting the role of environmental temperature in shaping ibex behavioural patterns and, ultimately, its energy intake (summarised in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). We showed that with rising temperatures the outcome of the trade-off between thermoregulation and foraging drove males to feed in areas characterized by lower NDVI. Male ibex cannot compensate for reduced forage quality by increasing bite rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> nor by increasing the amount of time allocated to foraging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, whereas it seems that they can only decrease their selectivity in picking food to at least maintain feed intake to certain levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Consequently, heat stress affects ibex energy intake, precisely during the critical period for their body growth, i.e. spring and summer period (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). It is worth noting that we analysed resource selection exactly during the hours when ibex typically (or are strongly expected to) forage, i.e., at dawn and dusk. Ibex did trade thermal cover (e.g., shade within rocky areas with low NDVI values) for optimal foraging exactly when they were supposed to forage early in the morning and late in the evening. Omitting considerations about animal activity in resource selection analysis may lead to misleading results. For instance, if selection of thermal cover occurs only during the resting period (i.e., during the central part of the day), then no direct effects are expected on the energy intake. This is the case of male white-tailed deer (<italic>Odocoileus virginianus</italic>) which selected cooler areas at midday, when they were less active, and areas with greater food quality in the morning and at night, when they typically forage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Consequently, the avoidance of heat stress did not seem to negatively affect the deer&#x02019;s energy intake. Our results, instead, clearly show that male ibex traded food for thermal cover precisely during the hours when they typically forage, thus arguably compromising food intake.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Conceptual diagram of the causality links affecting behavioural decisions and related consequences in a heat-sensitive mountain ungulate such as the Alpine Ibex.

Contrary to our expectations, however, ibex clearly avoided slopes with stronger wind, particularly if it blew from the North. This suggests that wind was perceived by ibex as a disturbing factor, corroborating the findings on other ungulate species, which were found to avoid windy areas and decrease their activity levels in windy conditions (e.g.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>).

Strong winds in fact could inhibit the preys&#x02019; hearing and olfactory capacity to detect predators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Thus, it seems that in ungulates the negative effects of wind outweigh any potential advantage related to heat dissipation. Such finding pointed out that the potential advantages evolved by ungulate species to reduce predation risk, in this case the avoidance of windy slopes, may be an impediment to face increasingly warmer climate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Simulated ibex resource selection as a response to future climate change</title><p id="Par25">Our study offers a rather pessimistic view of the future of mountain heat-sensitive species. Under the more optimistic hypothesis of a stabilisation of the anthropogenic climate forcing during the 21st century (RCP 4.5 scenarios<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>), and arguing that all other covariates will remain unvaried (which is a best case scenario), our simulations predicted that, in 90 years&#x02019; time, the extent of the areas more likely selected by ibex during foraging in summer will be less than a half with respect to those selected in 2011. This phenomenon is expected to be more dramatic under the hypothesis of an uninterrupted increase in the evolution of anthropogenic climate forcing (RCP 8.5 scenarios<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>): in 90 years&#x02019; time, ibex will more likely be restricted to less than one third of the areas that they selected in 2011. With future rising temperatures the avoidance of heat stress will obviously increasingly influence endotherms&#x02019; habitat selection. To avoid the risk of overheating, organisms commonly use thermally buffered microhabitats, such as shaded areas, North-facing slopes and windy areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Our resource selection analyses, however, suggested that during the foraging activity ibex did not avoid heat stress by selecting either north-facing slopes or windy areas. Additionally, the lack of woody vegetation above 2000 m a.s.l. in the Alps and most other mountain ranges seems to exclude the possibility of finding shelter under the canopy cover. Ibex buffer against high temperatures mainly by moving to higher elevations: our simulations showed that the probability of selection of these areas will increase more and more in 2040, 2070, and 2100. The upslope range shift is a common pattern in the response to global warming for a vast array of animal species, from invertebrate to mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, and has been documented already in other mountain ungulates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. When the species distribution shifts toward the top of mountains, their range-size shrinks, as a result of the progressively diminishing ratio of terrain available and consequent loss of suitable habitat (e.g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>).

Likewise, management strategies minimising disturbance and stress factors need to be implemented at a local level, with the aim to favour the protection of the areas where ibex will find thermal-refugia during hot summers.

The small-scale analysis, therefore, defines a set of available resources that are reachable by each monitored ibex in a given month, whereas the large-scale analysis is less restrictive and considers the resources available to each monitored ibex throughout the whole population range (<italic>sensu</italic> Thurfjell <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup>).</p><p id="Par43">When depicting random availability in resource selection analyses, the number of available random points per used point may affect parameter estimates, which can be particularly unstable when sample size for random availability is low<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup> (see also Box 2 in Roberts <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref></sup>).

Given that these <italic>a priori</italic> defined model structures could potentially include collinear predictors and that the number of parameters could possibly exceed that which could be estimated with our sample size (i.e., failing to convergence), we applied a step-by-step protocol to remove collinear predictors and reasonably simplify the model structure.</p><p id="Par47">Predictors were screened for collinearity (Pearson correlation matrix) and multicollinearity (Variance Inflation Factor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref></sup>, with thresholds set to |r<sub>p</sub>|&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.7 and VIF&#x02009;=&#x02009;3, respectively). As elevation was collinear with NDVI, we retained the latter because of its relevance in ibex ecology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. Maximum daily temperatures and hourly temperatures were also collinear. However, to test the hypothesis that ibex may have evolved the ability to select habitats according to daily temperature trends, we built alternative models using either the hourly temperature or the maximum daily temperature as a covariate, for both spatial scales. As several other pairs of covariates were found to be collinear, they were screened with a machine learning method (<italic>randomForest</italic> package, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;500 decision trees<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref></sup>) to select candidate predictors for the four final models (i.e., two spatial scales associated with two alternative temperature metrics). Consequently, distance from safe areas defined by a slope steeper than 45&#x000b0; outranked the distance defined by a slope steeper than 30&#x000b0;; likewise, slope outranked the terrain ruggedness index. Julian day was found to be the best predictor of temporal variation in resource selection and we dropped the other time predictors (e.g., month of the year, season). Finally, while in large-scale models the (continuous) time of the day was preferred over its categorical version (dawn, day, dusk), it was dropped in small-scale models because it was collinear with hourly air temperatures.</p><p id="Par48">Once the collinear predictors were removed, we further simplified the structure of our <italic>a priori</italic> starting models by running a second random forest analysis with all the remaining candidate predictors. To this end, the following predictors were also dropped: ibex age, the estimated number of hikers along hiking trails, time of the day and land cover. Finally, a manual step AIC procedure was run to remove the predictors that contributed to the increase of model AIC (i.e., worst model performances). With this procedure we removed: (i) solar radiation in all alternative models; (ii) the interaction between hourly temperature and Julian day in the large-scale model with hourly temperature; (iii) the interaction between air temperature (in both metrics) and Julian day in small-scale models.</p><p id="Par49">We finally fit and compared the obtained simplified versions of our alternative <italic>a priori</italic> models built with different air temperature metrics using AIC.
