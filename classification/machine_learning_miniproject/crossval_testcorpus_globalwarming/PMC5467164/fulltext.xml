Here we show using observations and an ensemble of global warming simulations the combined impact of the El Ni&#x000f1;o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon and long-term warming on regional SAT extremes. We find a robust relationship between ENSO and southeast Asian SATs wherein virtually all April extremes occur during El Ni&#x000f1;o years. We then quantify the relative contributions of long-term warming and the 2015&#x02013;16 El Ni&#x000f1;o to the extreme April 2016 SATs. The results indicate that global warming increases the likelihood of record-breaking April extremes where we estimate that 29&#x00025; of the 2016 anomaly was caused by warming and 49&#x00025; by El Ni&#x000f1;o. These post-Ni&#x000f1;o Aprils can potentially be anticipated a few months in advance, and thus, help societies prepare for the projected continued increases in extremes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>Record temperatures in mainland Southeast Asia in April 2016 had severe impacts on the population.

In the MSA region, which encompasses Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam and peninsular Malaysia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>), April is particularly prone to experiencing record-breaking SATs as it is climatologically the warmest month of the year (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p><p>Studies using climate models suggest that tropical land areas, particularly Central Africa, the Maritime Continent and the Indian Ocean rim, will show the most rapid and robust intensification of peak seasonal temperatures, with at least 60&#x00025; of regional land areas exceeding the late twentieth century maximum around the mid-twenty-first century<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>.

Perhaps the hot April of 2016 is an indication that the MSA region is already experiencing a departure from its pre-industrial climate, as predicted by the models? These studies indicate that on the spatial scales of MSA, long-term warming is expected to emerge sooner in the lower latitudes relative to anywhere else on the planet. This occurs because lower latitudes experience naturally lower year-to-year variability compared to higher latitude continental regions, thus allowing for an earlier detection of climate departures from a reference state<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. For this reason the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 5th Assessment Report concluded with high confidence that relative to natural variability, near-term increases in seasonal and annual mean temperatures are expected to be larger in the tropics and subtropics than in mid-latitude regions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.</p><p>In this work, we use observations as well as an ensemble of global warming simulations to understand the relationship between long-term warming and natural climate variability in MSA, and their combined impact on extreme SATs. We demonstrate that extreme April SATs in the region occur after the peak of El Ni&#x000f1;o years and characterize the impact of long-term warming on these events. Finally, we quantify the relative contributions of the El Ni&#x000f1;o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and long-term warming in producing the April 2016 event and demonstrate that with the continued march of ongoing global warming, record-breaking SATs in MSA will occur more frequently in the future.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>El Ni&#x000f1;o and April SATs in MSA</title><p>Climate in the MSA region exhibits pronounced year-to-year variability that is strongly linked to the ENSO phenomenon<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. April SATs over MSA are highly correlated (<italic>r</italic>=0.73) with the Ni&#x000f1;o-3.4 sea-surface temperature (SST) index, a common metric used to monitor ENSO variability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> that peaks during the December&#x02013;January&#x02013;February (DJF) season (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Positive DJF Ni&#x000f1;o-3.4 SST anomalies are associated with El Ni&#x000f1;o events and correspond to positive April SAT anomalies in MSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>; hereafter &#x02018;post-Ni&#x000f1;o Aprils'; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>).

SAT anomalies from the GISTEMP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> and CRU<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> (land) and HadISST<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> (oceans) data sets show that, on average, post-Ni&#x000f1;o Aprils are characterized by warming over MSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,c</xref>), with enhanced warming over land. The April temperature response in the region to El Ni&#x000f1;o is among the largest in the world. This pattern is robust across the observational data sets, which show that, on average, post-Ni&#x000f1;o Aprils are accompanied by 0.6&#x02013;0.7&#x02009;&#x000b0;C of warming in MSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). A similar pattern of land amplification of the post-Ni&#x000f1;o April heat is seen in an ensemble of simulations of twentieth and twenty-first century climate performed with the Community Earth System Model Version 1 Large Ensemble (CESM1-LE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>) and the CMIP5 suite of model members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2g</xref>), confirming the observed MSA April-El-Ni&#x000f1;o link<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>.</p><p>These composite analyses reveal that peak seasonal SATs in the MSA region are highly sensitive to El Ni&#x000f1;o. Previous studies proposed that changes in atmospheric circulation associated with El Ni&#x000f1;o reduce cloud cover over the land areas of the Maritime Continent and Indian Ocean rim causing the associated warming<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. To test whether clouds play a role causing extremes SATs over MSA, we performed a composite analysis of cloud cover anomalies during post-Ni&#x000f1;o Aprils using land- and ship-based observations together with reanalysis data as well as CESM1-LE and CMIP5 output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). We find that cloud cover observations from the ERA-interim data set<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> and CRU (land) and ICOADS (ocean) data sets<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> show, on average, reduced cloud cover over MSA during post-Ni&#x000f1;o Aprils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b,d</xref>). These reductions in cloud cover appear to be linked with increased cloud cover over the central Pacific, suggesting that the SST anomalies associated with decaying El Ni&#x000f1;o events could be driving anomalous overturning circulation in the atmosphere and thereby creating drought conditions over southeast Asia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 2 and 3</xref>; ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). Our analysis shows that during April, the area of reduced rainfall and cloud cover has moved from the Maritime Continent, where El Ni&#x000f1;o impacts are more pronounced at their winter peak, to over MSA and the Philippines, explaining the region's sensitivity to ENSO.</p><p>The CESM1-LE and CMIP5 ensemble means simulate remarkably realistic patterns of surface temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e,g</xref>) and cloud cover anomalies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f,h</xref>), compared with observations from different data sets. This lends further support for a robust relationship between El Ni&#x000f1;o and hot April extremes in MSA inferred from observations. The CESM1-LE also simulates ENSO realistically (DiNezio <italic>et al</italic>. in prep) including the tropical SST patterns as well as circulation anomalies and teleconnections (see Methods for details on these simulations). The realism of CESM1 allows us to use data from the Large Ensemble, consisting of output from 39 simulations of twentieth and twenty-first century climate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, to explore the effect of long-term anthropogenic warming as well as El Ni&#x000f1;o on extreme seasonal temperatures over MSA.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Histogram analysis of April SATs</title><p>Do all El Ni&#x000f1;o events lead to hotter Aprils over MSA? We address this question by analysing the effect of El Ni&#x000f1;o and La Ni&#x000f1;a (El Ni&#x000f1;o 's cooler counterpart) on the distribution of April SATs. In both observations and simulations, after linearly detrending the data sets over their entire length to remove the long-term warming trend, we divided all April monthly mean SATs into distributions of post-El Ni&#x000f1;o and post-La Ni&#x000f1;a Aprils. The resulting distributions show that indeed the tails of the April MSA SATs are linked to ENSO variability. Both observations and model data show that post-El Ni&#x000f1;o Aprils are on average hotter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a&#x02013;c</xref>, red bars) than post-La Ni&#x000f1;a Aprils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a&#x02013;c</xref>, blue bars). Moreover, virtually all hot Aprils occurs following El Ni&#x000f1;o events (80&#x00025; for GISTEMP, &#x0223c;73&#x00025; for CRU, and &#x0223c;88&#x00025; for CESM1-LE post-Ni&#x000f1;o April extremes had &#x0003e;29&#x02009;&#x000b0;C detrended SAT values). The fact that the simulations accurately capture this shift in the distribution is indicative that the effect of ENSO on extreme SATs in MSA is robust.</p><p>Next, we looked into the effect of long-term regional warming on the observed and simulated distributions of all April SATs in MSA. Here, we divided the data sets into two equal subperiods and detrended the data over each subperiod (GISTEMP: 1940&#x02013;1977 and 1978&#x02013;2016; CRU: 1901&#x02013;1958 and 1959&#x02013;2015; CESM1-LE: 1920&#x02013;1968 and 1969&#x02013;2015). This ensures that the mean warming between the individual time periods is retained for each data set despite differing time periods (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 4 and 5</xref>). The long-term warming results in distributions of April SATs with significant positive shifts in the mean according to a two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01). The distribution of SATs shifts due to this change in the mean and results in an increase of extreme SATs in the latter subperiod.</p><p>Lastly, we performed a similar analysis of only post-Ni&#x000f1;o Aprils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c,f,i</xref>). We find that the latter subperiods show more extreme post-Ni&#x000f1;o April SATs because of a significant shift in the mean of the distribution (two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) but statistically indistinguishable variance (f-test; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05). Changes in the tails of the distribution caused by shifts in the mean, similar to the ones identified here, are the most straightforward way in which global warming can lead to increased frequency of extremes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Although increased extremes can also arise from increased variability, we do not observe statistically distinguishable variance between the two subperiods across any of these distributions (<italic>f</italic>-test; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05). Thus, the mean shift in post-Ni&#x000f1;o April SATs underpins long-term warming as the most likely cause of the increasing extremes in MSA.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Attribution of extreme April SATs</title><p>Based on this assessment of the roles of El Ni&#x000f1;o and long-term warming in modulating April SATs, we built a statistical model to attribute the 2016 event and other April extremes in MSA.

This analysis yielded a fit that has a high correlation coefficient (<italic>r</italic>=0.83) with April temperature observations from 1940 to 2016 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>), indicating that long-term warming and DJF ENSO amplitude explain much of the SAT variability during April in MSA. The unexplained residual between our regression fit and the observed anomaly (termed &#x02018;other') appears to be related to mid-latitude weather over Asia or local weather (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Discussion</xref>). However, as the statistical model explains a large component of April SATs, we used the regression model to attribute the relative contributions of long-term warming and ENSO in producing observed extremes in MSA.</p><p>We chose the 15 hottest Aprils (greater than the 80th percentile of the warmest Aprils) from the entire GISTEMP data set (1940&#x02013;2016) and based on our regression model, investigated the influence of long-term warming versus El Ni&#x000f1;o in each April extreme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). All 15 events occur after 1980, i.e., in the latter, warmer subperiod of our previous analysis. April 2016 is the warmest on record, surpassing the previous record holder, April 1998, by 0.9&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Both of these record-breaking Aprils occurred after the peak of extremely strong El Ni&#x000f1;o events (1997&#x02013;1998 and 2015&#x02013;2016). The ENSO contribution typically accounts for 30&#x02013;75&#x00025; (0.25&#x02013;1.15&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) of the hot April SAT anomaly in MSA during those hot April events coinciding with El Ni&#x000f1;o years. Indeed, the eight hottest Aprils (&#x0003e;90th percentile) all coincided with El Ni&#x000f1;o years (labelled in red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>), with the notable exception of April 2001 where the residual term dominates. On the other hand, the recent hot Aprils of 2001, 2013 and 2014 do not occur during El Ni&#x000f1;o years, and as such, their anomalies (albeit minor) are mainly explained by long-term warming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). However, even though the regression model cannot fully explain the observed anomalies for these outliers (see residual component labelled &#x02018;other' in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>), it does indicate that long-term warming is increasingly playing a role (&#x0223c;25&#x02013;60&#x00025;) in producing extreme April SATs in the absence of El Ni&#x000f1;o events. The regression model also indicates an upward trend in the relative contribution of long-term warming, which increases across these 15 events until 2016, and will foreseeably increase as regional warming continues to influence hot Aprils.</p><p>The regression model indicates that the long-term warming trend caused &#x0223c;29&#x00025; of the extreme 2016 April SAT in MSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Despite its unprecedented strength, El Ni&#x000f1;o accounted for &#x0223c;49&#x00025; of the record-breaking hot April of 2016, leaving 22&#x00025; unexplained. If some amount of the unexplained portion of the 2016 April SAT, apart from the contribution of weather-related noise, arose from a nonlinear change in the rate of global warming<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, the imprint of regional warming on the 2016 extreme would be even larger than our estimate. Regardless of this unexplained portion, our regression model holds predictive value<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> as the DJF Ni&#x000f1;o-3.4 SST anomaly can be observed months before the potential hot April.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Future temperature extremes in MSA</title><p>With continued warming projected for the rest of this century<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, will MSA experience more frequent, record-breaking hot Aprils? We investigated the likelihood of MSA extremes becoming more common in the future by analysing SAT data from the CESM1-LE. Starting from 1940 and using a non-overlapping moving window of 30 years, we calculated the hottest April in each of the ensemble members for that baseline period. For each of these record hot Aprils, we also calculated the DJF Ni&#x000f1;o-3.4 SST anomaly of that year. We then determined the lead time for the next, new, record-breaking April across each member (i.e. difference in years between the baseline record and new record). For each lead time, we also computed the DJF Ni&#x000f1;o-3.4 SST anomaly for that year in order to explore the control of El Ni&#x000f1;o on April extremes. Finally, we repeated this procedure for windows from 1940&#x02013;1970 to 2030&#x02013;2060 to understand the effect of warming on the lead-time for the next record-breaking April (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>).</p><p>The median lead times across all ensemble members indicate that indeed, with future warming, record-breaking April SATs occur more frequently in MSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>), a result in agreement with the statistics of record-breaking events<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. The simulations suggest that record-breaking April SATs relative to an early twentieth century baseline occurred during large El Ni&#x000f1;o events (DJF Ni&#x000f1;o-3.4 SST anomaly &#x0003e;2&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) whereas record-breaking April events in the twenty-first century can occur during El Ni&#x000f1;o events of smaller magnitudes. We note that 88.5&#x00025; (414 out of 468) of all record-breaking extremes occur during El Ni&#x000f1;o years (DJF Ni&#x000f1;o-3.4 SST anomaly &#x0003e;0.5&#x02009;&#x000b0;C), where 63&#x00025; (260 out of 414) occur during strong events (DJF Ni&#x000f1;o-3.4 SST anomaly &#x0003e;2&#x02009;&#x000b0;C). Thus, even though global warming will induce more extreme SATs in the future for the MSA region, our findings are advantageous for anticipating hot Aprils by monitoring the peak of Ni&#x000f1;o-3.4 SSTs a few months in advance.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Understanding and projecting the impacts of global warming on regional extremes is of critical importance for adaptation purposes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. On the spatiotemporal scales addressed in this study, the magnitude of natural variability is large relative to long-term trends and makes the detection and attribution of global warming more challenging. While located in the tropics, MSA is an exception to the general rule that anthropogenic warming will emerge sooner in the low latitudes, as shown by the prominent effect of ENSO on SAT variability in the region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2</xref>). The hot April of 2016 is an example of such ENSO-modulated extremes. Nevertheless, by focusing on post-El Ni&#x000f1;o Aprils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>), and because the strong correlation with ENSO allows for the removal of its effect, we were able to detect the impact of long-term warming on observed record-breaking SATs in MSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Despite a low number of El Ni&#x000f1;o events in the observational record, the CESM1-LE simulations provide conclusive statistics that long-term warming is increasingly aggravating the effect of El Ni&#x000f1;o in governing the frequency of these extremes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). It is very likely that continued warming in the region will continue to conspire with El Ni&#x000f1;o in order to bring more common record-breaking extremes in the future. Even though the record-breaking April 2016 extreme in MSA was primed by the El Ni&#x000f1;o of 2015, compared to previous post-Ni&#x000f1;o extremes, the influence of long-term warming is incontrovertible. Furthermore, the influence of long-term warming on future El Ni&#x000f1;o impacts will only rise in importance. These extreme events could be quantitatively predicted some months in advance, and can thereby increase the preparedness of societies that will be impacted.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Surface temperature data sets</title><p>We used four different observational data sets for analysing surface temperature in MSA: GISTEMP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, CRU Ver 3.23 (ref. 3), HadISST1.1 (ref. 21) and the satellite-based MODIS data set<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. The majority of our analysis on MSA were performed using the GISTEMP data set spanning from 1940 to 2016 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref>). 1940 was chosen as the start year due to the increasing density of temperature stations in MSA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, which is also reflected in the improved agreement between CRU and GISTEMP after 1940 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Composite post-Ni&#x000f1;o April analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref> was performed jointly on the CRU (land) and HadISST (ocean) data sets from 1900 to 2014. We used the ICOADS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, ERA-Interim<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> and HadSLP2 data sets<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> to investigate cloud cover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b&#x02013;d</xref>), surface energy fluxes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>) and sea-level pressure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). We also use temperature station data for Bangkok (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>) spanning from 1870 to 2013 taken from the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature data set<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Though this was available from 1813, we only focus on the post-1870 period because of the availability of HadISST1.1 data to compute the Ni&#x000f1;o-3.4 SST index. Unless stated otherwise, we employed linear detrending to remove trends throughout our study. For both observations and simulations, we used the same spatial extent of the MSA box for analysis (6&#x02013;22&#x02009;&#x000b0;N, 94&#x02013;110&#x02009;&#x000b0;E).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Climate model simulations</title><p>We used model output from the Community Earth System Model Version 1 (CESM1) which consists of a large ensemble (hereinafter CESM1-LE) of 39 simulation of climate from 1920 to 2100 (ref. 22). The large number of realizations allows us to perform a more robust statistical analysis of the link between El Ni&#x000f1;o and extreme April SATs for this study, as well attributes the changes to increasing anthropogenic forcings. All the simulations were run with historical forcings until the year 2005, after which the forcings follow the RCP8.5 scenario<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Each member is unique due to the application of a small, random perturbation to the initial air temperature at 1920, which leads to independent simulated trajectories in weather and internal climate variability among the members. However, since external forcings are the same, all the members contain the same anthropogenic (forced) response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.</p><p>ENSO variability arises spontaneously in the CESM1-LE set of simulations where many aspects of El Ni&#x000f1;o and La Nina events are realistically simulated, although El Ni&#x000f1;o events show amplitudes that exceed those of observed events<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. For the composite analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>), El Ni&#x000f1;o events were selected from 1920 to 2015 in each member based on the peak of SST anomalies in the Ni&#x000f1;o-3.4 region that were larger than 0.5 standard deviations of the entire time series of each ensemble member. The composite plot was not sensitive to whether this threshold was increased to 0.75 standard deviations or 1 standard deviation. Over this time period, prior to picking El Ni&#x000f1;o events, we linearly detrended the Ni&#x000f1;o-3.4 SST timeseries simulated in each member to separate ENSO from the long-term warming trend. As stated in the main text, for plotting purposes, we downscaled the CESM1-LE composite SAT values by 0.45 over land and the oceans so that the April composite SST anomalies averaged over the Ni&#x000f1;o-3.4 region agree in magnitude with the observed April HadISST1.1 composite.</p><p>We also performed similar analyses on a 10-member ensemble of simulations from the Community Atmosphere Model Version 5 run in Tropical Ocean-Global Atmosphere configuration (CAM5-TOGA; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). The CAM5-TOGA simulations, which are designed to simulate atmospheric variability uncoupled from the ocean, are run with observed SST fields in the tropics, whereby ENSO events occur with the same timing and amplitude as in nature. Thus, as opposed to the CESM1-LE, ENSO events are prescribed in these set of simulations. However, similar to the CESM1-LE, each member is uniquely different also due to small perturbations in initial air temperature conditions, resulting in independent weather trajectories. We find that composite analysis of post-Ni&#x000f1;o Aprils as well as histograms obtained from CAM5-TOGA agree with CESM1-LE and also with the observations (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figs 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we used the CESM1-LE set of simulations for analysing the lead time and the corresponding DJF Ni&#x000f1;o-3.4 SST anomaly for new record-breaking April SAT extremes relative to a baseline period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). For this analysis, we used a non-overlapping sliding window from 1940 to 1970 until 2030 to 2060 and found that increasing/decreasing the baseline period by up to 10 years and/or allowing overlap did not change our findings, i.e., lead times and magnitude of DJF Ni&#x000f1;o3.4-SST anomalies required for future record-breaking Aprils decrease with the advent of long-term warming in MSA. We refrained from using the complete data set from 1920 to 2100 due to potential edge effects affecting our analysis (e.g. as detailed by Hawkins <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>).</p><p>For the 1920&#x02013;2060 time range, our ENSO definition is based on detrended Ni&#x000f1;o-3.4 data to separate ENSO from global warming. Instead of directly removing trends however, we removed the forced warming from the Ni&#x000f1;o3.4 timeseries, which we compute from the ensemble-mean Ni&#x000f1;o-3.4 timeseries. Small interannual variability remains in the ensemble mean, which we smooth using a 10-year low pass filter. Then we remove this estimate of the forced warming from the Ni&#x000f1;o-3.4 index from each individual member to isolate the unforced variability. We chose El Ni&#x000f1;o (La Ni&#x000f1;a) events as those years where peak SSTs were higher (lower) than 0.5 standard deviations of the overall timeseries in each member after subtracting the 10-year smoothed ensemble mean of Ni&#x000f1;o-3.4. Our results were not affected if we chose 0.5 standard deviations or 1 standard deviation to pick ENSO events.

The fit yielded a high correlation coefficient (<italic>r</italic>=0.83; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>), which indicates that ENSO and global warming explain much of the April SAT variability. The analysis and results were similar even when we used only the December Ni&#x000f1;o-3.4 SST anomaly (<italic>r</italic>=0.76), no quadratic long-term warming term and only a linear component (<italic>r</italic>=0.74), or global mean surface temperatures instead of April SATs in MSA (<italic>r</italic>=0.80). However, the regression configuration used in the main text provided the highest correlation coefficient. We used this regression to attribute April extremes in MSA to El Ni&#x000f1;o and long-term warming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). The negative contributions of El Ni&#x000f1;o, although minimal (&#x0003c;10&#x00025;) for the three non-El-Ni&#x000f1;o extremes (2001, 2013, and 2014), are not shown.
