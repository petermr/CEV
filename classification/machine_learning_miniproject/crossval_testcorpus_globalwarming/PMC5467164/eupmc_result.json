Here we show using observations and an ensemble of global warming simulations the combined impact of the El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon and long-term warming on regional SAT extremes. We find a robust relationship between ENSO and southeast Asian SATs wherein virtually all April extremes occur during El Ni\u00f1o years. We then quantify the relative contributions of long-term warming and the 2015-16 El Ni\u00f1o to the extreme April 2016 SATs. The results indicate that global warming increases the likelihood of record-breaking April extremes where we estimate that 29% of the 2016 anomaly was caused by warming and 49% by El Ni\u00f1o. These post-Ni\u00f1o Aprils can potentially be anticipated a few months in advance, and thus, help societies prepare for the projected continued increases in extremes.", "affiliation": "Institute for Geophysics, Jackson School of Geosciences, University of Texas at Austin, J.
