In healthy individuals with no underlying co-morbid conditions, there is an efficient heat regulation system which enables the body to effectively handle thermal stress. However, in vulnerable groups, especially in elderly over the age of 65\u00a0years, infants and individuals with co-morbid cardiovascular and/or respiratory conditions, there is a deficiency in thermoregulation. When temperatures exceed a certain limit, being cold winter spells or heat waves, there is an increase in the number of deaths. In particular, it has been shown that at temperatures above 27\u00a0\u00b0C, the daily mortality rate increases more rapidly per degree rise compared to when it drops below 27\u00a0\u00b0C. This is especially of relevance with the current emergency of global warming. Besides the direct effect of temperature rises on human health, global warming will have a negative impact on primary producers and livestock, leading to malnutrition, which will in turn lead to a myriad of health related issues. This is further exacerbated by environmental pollution. Public health measures that countries should follow should include not only health-related information strategies aiming to reduce the exposure to heat for vulnerable individuals and the community, but improved urban planning and reduction in energy consumption, among many others.

However, in vulnerable groups, especially in elderly over the age of 65\u00a0years, infants and individuals with co-morbid cardiovascular and/or respiratory conditions, there is a deficiency in thermoregulation. When temperatures exceed a certain limit, being cold winter spells or heat waves, there is an increase in the number of deaths. In particular, it has been shown that at temperatures above 27\u00a0\u00b0C, the daily mortality rate increases more rapidly per degree rise compared to when it drops below 27\u00a0\u00b0C. This is especially of relevance with the current emergency of global warming. Besides the direct effect of temperature rises on human health, global warming will have a negative impact on primary producers and livestock, leading to malnutrition, which will in turn lead to a myriad of health related issues. This is further exacerbated by environmental pollution. Public health measures that countries should follow should include not only health-related information strategies aiming to reduce the exposure to heat for vulnerable individuals and the community, but improved urban planning and reduction in energy consumption, among many others. This will reduce the carbon footprint and help avert global warming, thus reducing mortality.", "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7536190?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Early human development", "authorinfo": ["Calleja-Agius J", "England K", "Calleja N"], "title": "The effect of global warming on mortality."}, "PMC7946882": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "33692343", "source": "MED", "pmid": "33692343", "pmcid": "PMC7946882", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC7946882"}, "doi": "10.1038/s41467-021-21815-y", "title": "Malaria trends in Ethiopian highlands track the 2000 'slowdown' in global warming.", "authorString": "Rod\u00f3 X, Martinez PP, Siraj A, Pascual M.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Rod\u00f3 X", "firstName": "Xavier", "lastName": "Rod\u00f3", "initials": "X", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-4843-6180"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "ICREA and CLIMA (Climate and Health) Program, ISGlobal, Barcelona, Spain."}}}, {"fullName": "Martinez PP", "firstName": "Pamela P", "lastName": "Martinez", "initials": "PP", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-3607-0938"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": [{"affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, T.H.

Whether the precipitation intensification occurred in response to historical warming continues to be a subject of debate. Here, using observations of the ocean surface energy balance as a hydrological constraint, we find that historical warming intensified precipitation at a rate of 0.68\u2009\u00b1\u20090.51% K<sup>-1</sup>, which is slightly higher than the multi-model mean calculation for the historical climate (0.38\u2009\u00b1\u20091.18% K<sup>-1</sup>).

Temperature is an important environmental factor affecting almost all aspects of growth and development in plants. The grapevine (<i>Vitis</i> spp.) is quite sensitive to extreme temperatures. Over the current century, temperatures are projected to continue rising with negative impacts on viticulture. These consequences range from short-term effects on wine quality to long-term issues such as the suitability of certain varieties and the sustainability of viticulture in traditional wine regions. Many viticultural zones, particularly in Mediterranean climate regions, may not be suitable for growing winegrapes in the near future unless we develop heat-stress-adapted genotypes or identify and exploit stress-tolerant germplasm. Grapevines, like other plants, have developed strategies to maintain homeostasis and cope with high-temperature stress.

Temperature is an important environmental factor affecting almost all aspects of growth and development in plants. The grapevine (<i>Vitis</i> spp.) is quite sensitive to extreme temperatures. Over the current century, temperatures are projected to continue rising with negative impacts on viticulture. These consequences range from short-term effects on wine quality to long-term issues such as the suitability of certain varieties and the sustainability of viticulture in traditional wine regions. Many viticultural zones, particularly in Mediterranean climate regions, may not be suitable for growing winegrapes in the near future unless we develop heat-stress-adapted genotypes or identify and exploit stress-tolerant germplasm. Grapevines, like other plants, have developed strategies to maintain homeostasis and cope with high-temperature stress. These mechanisms include physiological adaptations and activation of signaling pathways and gene regulatory networks governing heat stress response and acquisition of thermotolerance. Here, we review the major impacts of global warming on grape phenology and viticulture and focus on the physiological and molecular responses of the grapevine to heat stress.", "Keywords": ["Vitis", "Phenology", "Grapevine", "Heat stress", "Global warming", "Wine", "Molecular Responses", "Viticulture"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7763569?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Plants (Basel, Switzerland)", "authorinfo": ["Venios X", "Korkas E", "Nisiotou A", "Banilas G"], "title": "Grapevine Responses to Heat Stress and Global Warming."}, "PMC7528971": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "33039256", "source": "MED", "pmid": "33039256", "pmcid": "PMC7528971", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC7528971"}, "doi": "10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2020.105216", "title": "WITHDRAWN: Some health effects of global warming.", "authorString": "Grech V, Cuschieri S.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Grech V", "firstName": "Victor", "lastName": "Grech", "initials": "V", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Mater Dei Hospital, Malta.

However, wheat production and quality will scarcely fulfill forward demands, which are compounded by high-temperature (HT) events as heatwaves, increasingly common in Portugal. Thus, landraces assume crucial importance as potential reservoirs of useful traits for wheat breeding and may be pre-adapted to extreme environmental conditions. This work evaluates four Portuguese landrace yield and grain composition through attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, particularly protein content, and their responses to HT treatment mimicking a heatwave. Landraces showed distinct yield traits, especially plant height and first spike grain number, and a similar pattern in FTIR spectra, although revealing differences in grain components' proportions. Comparison between spectra band intensity indicates that Ardito has the highest protein-related peaks, contrary to Magueija, which appears to be the landrace with higher lipid content. In plants submitted to 1 week of HT treatment 10 days after anthesis, the first spike grain size and weight were markedly reduced in all landraces. Additionally, it was observed that a general increase in grain protein content in the four landraces, being the increment observed in Ardito and Gr\u00e9cia, is statistically significant. The comparative assessment of control and HT average FTIR spectra denoted also the occurrence of alterations in grain polysaccharide composition. An integrated assessment of the evaluations performed revealed that Ardito and Magueija landraces presented diverse yield-related characteristics and distinct responses to cope with HT.

However, wheat production and quality will scarcely fulfill forward demands, which are compounded by high-temperature (HT) events as heatwaves, increasingly common in Portugal. Thus, landraces assume crucial importance as potential reservoirs of useful traits for wheat breeding and may be pre-adapted to extreme environmental conditions. This work evaluates four Portuguese landrace yield and grain composition through attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, particularly protein content, and their responses to HT treatment mimicking a heatwave. Landraces showed distinct yield traits, especially plant height and first spike grain number, and a similar pattern in FTIR spectra, although revealing differences in grain components' proportions. Comparison between spectra band intensity indicates that Ardito has the highest protein-related peaks, contrary to Magueija, which appears to be the landrace with higher lipid content. In plants submitted to 1 week of HT treatment 10 days after anthesis, the first spike grain size and weight were markedly reduced in all landraces. Additionally, it was observed that a general increase in grain protein content in the four landraces, being the increment observed in Ardito and Gr\u00e9cia, is statistically significant. The comparative assessment of control and HT average FTIR spectra denoted also the occurrence of alterations in grain polysaccharide composition. An integrated assessment of the evaluations performed revealed that Ardito and Magueija landraces presented diverse yield-related characteristics and distinct responses to cope with HT. In fact, the former landrace revealed considerable grain yield diminution along with an increase in grain protein proportion after HT, while the latter showed a significant increase in spikes and grain number, with grain quality detriment.

Variability in our model projections highlights the importance of accounting for uncertainties in demographic and environmental parameters, structural assumptions of global climate models, and greenhouse gas emission scenarios when simulating species metapopulation dynamics under climate change.", "Keywords": ["Climate change", "Population Viability", "conservation management", "Extinction Risk", "Sea\u2010level Rise", "Demographic Model Uncertainty"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7548163?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Ecology and evolution", "authorinfo": ["Jones AR", "Jessop TS", "Ariefiandy A", "Brook BW", "Brown SC", "Ciofi C", "Benu YJ", "Purwandana D", "Sitorus T", "Wigley TML", "Fordham DA"], "title": "Identifying island safe havens to prevent the extinction of the World's largest lizard from global warming."}, "PMC6969058": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "31953496", "source": "MED", "pmid": "31953496", "pmcid": "PMC6969058", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC6969058"}, "doi": "10.1038/s41598-019-57280-3", "title": "Global vulnerability of marine mammals to global warming.", "authorString": "Albouy C, Delattre V, Donati G, Fr\u00f6licher TL, Albouy-Boyer S, Rufino M, Pellissier L, Mouillot D, Leprieur F.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Albouy C", "firstName": "Camille", "lastName": "Albouy", "initials": "C", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-1629-2389"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "IFREMER, unit\u00e9 Ecologie et Mod\u00e8les pour l'Halieutique, rue de l'Ile d'Yeu, BP21105, 44311, Nantes, cedex 3, France. albouycamille@gmail.com."}}}, {"fullName": "Delattre V", "firstName": "Valentine", "lastName": "Delattre", "initials": "V", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "MARBEC, Univ Montpellier, CNRS, Ifremer, IRD, Montpellier, France."}}}, {"fullName": "Donati G", "firstName": "Giulia", "lastName": "Donati", "initials": "G", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": [{"affiliation": "Landscape Ecology, Institute of Terrestrial Ecosystems, ETH Z\u00fcrich, 8092, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland."}, {"affiliation": "Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL, 8903, Birmensdorf, Switzerland."}]}}, {"fullName": "Fr\u00f6licher TL", "firstName": "Thomas L", "lastName": "Fr\u00f6licher", "initials": "TL", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": [{"affiliation": "Climate and Environmental Physics, Physics Institute, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland."}, {"affiliation": "Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland."}]}}, {"fullName": "Albouy-Boyer S", "firstName": "Severine", "lastName": "Albouy-Boyer", "initials": "S", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Cadres en Mission Nantes, Nantes, France."}}}, {"fullName": "Rufino M", "firstName": "Marta", "lastName": "Rufino", "initials": "M", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-0734-7491"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": [{"affiliation": "MARE -

A dataset on nylon bag degradability parameters bearing the chemical composition of roughages, grains, leaves, stems, fruits, concentrates and diets given to animals, climate type, and AT were compiled. Data were analysed using mixed model regression and simple linear regression methodologies. Negative correlations between AT and degradability parameters were observed. Potential degradability (PD) and slowly degradable fraction ('b') were higher for concentrates and mixed diets compared to roughages. Intermediate feeders had slower rates of degradation ('c') compared to grazers. Potential degradability was highest for studies carried out in cold and temperate climates compared to tropical and arid climates. A 1 \u00b0C increase in AT decreased PD by 0.39% (roughages), 0.76% (concentrates), and 2.41% (mixed diets), with an overall decrease of 0.55% for all feed types.

A dataset on nylon bag degradability parameters bearing the chemical composition of roughages, grains, leaves, stems, fruits, concentrates and diets given to animals, climate type, and AT were compiled. Data were analysed using mixed model regression and simple linear regression methodologies. Negative correlations between AT and degradability parameters were observed. Potential degradability (PD) and slowly degradable fraction ('b') were higher for concentrates and mixed diets compared to roughages. Intermediate feeders had slower rates of degradation ('c') compared to grazers. Potential degradability was highest for studies carried out in cold and temperate climates compared to tropical and arid climates. A 1 \u00b0C increase in AT decreased PD by 0.39% (roughages), 0.76% (concentrates), and 2.41% (mixed diets), with an overall decrease of 0.55% for all feed types.

climate is the dominant factor that affects the distribution of plants. Cuscuta chinensis is a stem holoparasitic plant without leaves or roots, which develops a haustorium and sucks nutrients from host plants. The potential distribution of the parasitic plant C. chinensis has not been predicted to date. This study used Maxent modeling to predict the potential global distribution of C. chinensis, based on the following six main bioclimatic variables: annual mean temperature, isothermality, temperature seasonality, precipitation seasonality, precipitation of the warmest quarter, and precipitation of the coldest quarter. RESULTS:The optimal annual average temperature and isothermality of C. chinensis ranged from 4 to 37\u00a0\u00b0C and less than 45, respectively, while the optimal temperature seasonality and precipitation seasonality ranged from 4000 to 25,000 and from 50 to 130, respectively. The optimal precipitation of the warmest season ranged from 300 to 1000\u00a0mm and from 2500 to 3500\u00a0mm, while that of the coldest season was less than 2000\u00a0mm. In Asia, C. chinensis is mainly distributed at latitudes ranging from 20\u00b0 N to 50\u00b0 N. During three specific historical periods (last glacial maximum, mid-Holocene, and 1960-1990) the habitats suitable for C. chinensis were concentrated in the central, northern, southern, and eastern parts of China. From the last glacial maximum to the mid-Holocene, the total area with suitability of 0.5-1 increased by 0.0875 million km2; however, from the mid-Holocene to 1960-1990, the total area with suitability of 0.5-1 decreased by 0.0759 million km2. The simulation results of habitat suitability in the two representative concentration pathways (RCP) 2.6 (i.e., the low greenhouse gas emissions pathway) and 8.5 (i.e., the high greenhouse gas emissions pathway) indicate that the habitat suitability of C. chinensis decreased in response to the warming climate. Compared with RCP2.6, areas with averaged suitability and high suitability for survival (RCP8.5) decreased by 0.18 million km2.

A potential option to reduce the cement production emissions is to use alternative fuels which can have also an impact on emissions from the waste management sector. This work investigates the change in global warming potential (GWP) of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) production and affected waste management systems when conventional fuels are partially replaced by solid recovered fuel (SRF) made from commercial and industrial waste (C&IW). A life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted with a functional unit of 1\u2009metric tonne of OPC production and treatment of 194\u2009kg of C&IW.

A potential option to reduce the cement production emissions is to use alternative fuels which can have also an impact on emissions from the waste management sector. This work investigates the change in global warming potential (GWP) of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) production and affected waste management systems when conventional fuels are partially replaced by solid recovered fuel (SRF) made from commercial and industrial waste (C&IW). A life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted with a functional unit of 1\u2009metric tonne of OPC production and treatment of 194\u2009kg of C&IW. Data from an existing cement plant have been used, where the share of SRF from total fuel energy demand increased from 0% to 53% between 2007 and 2016.

For the standard deviation of the 2-meter air temperature, and the mean and standard deviation of its range; although a linear regression analysis suggests a decline over time, the regression coefficient is not significant. On the other hand, the analysis of variance for the 9 years 1981, 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2019 suggests existence of statistical difference among them collectively, for the 2-meter air temperature and its range. In the second part of this work, NASA POWER data for the air temperature at 2 m above the ground, the atmospheric pressure, the relative humidity at 2 m above the ground, and the daily precipitation were compared with recorded sensor measurements at Manah meteorological station, located in Al Dakhiliyah Governate, in the Northeast of the Sultanate of Oman over all days of years 2011, 2012, 2015, and 2016. The statistical analysis and visual inspection suggest that NASA POWER data are reliable for the 2-meter air temperature, while showing about 2.1 kPa constant shift (underestimation) for the atmospheric pressure. The data show mild inaccuracy for the 2-meter relative humidity, but are largely unreliable for the precipitation, with significantly exaggerated values compared to real recordings.", "Keywords": ["Climate change", "Greenhouse effect", "Global warming", "Validation", "Oman", "Nasa Power", "Buraimi"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8035665?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Heliyon", "title": "Assessment of global warming in Al Buraimi, sultanate of Oman based on statistical analysis of NASA POWER data over 39 years, and testing the reliability of NASA POWER against meteorological measurements."}, "PMC7417736": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "32778666", "source": "MED", "pmid": "32778666", "pmcid": "PMC7417736", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC7417736"}, "doi": "10.1038/s41598-020-70372-9", "title": "Internal tides can provide thermal refugia that will buffer some coral reefs from future global warming.", "authorString": "Storlazzi CD, Cheriton OM, van Hooidonk R, Zhao Z, Brainard R.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Storlazzi CD", "firstName": "Curt D", "lastName": "Storlazzi", "initials": "CD", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "U.S. Geological Survey, Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center, 2885 Mission Street, Santa Cruz, CA, 95060, USA. cstorlazzi@usgs.gov."}}}, {"fullName": "Cheriton OM", "firstName": "Olivia M", "lastName": "Cheriton", "initials": "OM", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "U.S. Geological Survey, Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center, 2885 Mission Street, Santa Cruz, CA, 95060, USA."}}}, {"fullName": "van Hooidonk R", "firstName": "Ruben", "lastName": "van Hooidonk", "initials": "R", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies, University of Miami, Miami, FL, 33149, USA."}}}, {"fullName": "Zhao Z", "firstName": "Zhongxiang", "lastName": "Zhao", "initials": "Z", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Applied Physics Laboratory, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, 98105, USA."}}}, {"fullName": "Brainard R", "firstName": "Russell", "lastName": "Brainard", "initials": "R", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Red Sea Research Center, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia."}}}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": ["supporting_data", "altmetrics"]}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "1", "volume": "10", "journalIssueId": "2990842", "dateOfPublication": "2020 Aug", "monthOfPublication": "8", "yearOfPublication": "2020", "printPublicationDate": "2020-08-01", "journal": {"title": "Scientific reports", "ISOAbbreviation": "Sci Rep", "medlineAbbreviation": "Sci Rep", "NLMid": "101563288", "ISSN": "2045-2322", "ESSN": "2045-2322"}}, "pubYear": "2020", "pageInfo": "13435", "abstractText": "Observations show ocean temperatures are rising due to climate change, resulting in a fivefold increase in the incidence of regional-scale coral bleaching events since the 1980s; analyses based on global climate models forecast bleaching will become an annual event for most of the world's coral reefs within 30-50 yr.

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the global mean surface temperature could increase of approximately 2-4 \u00b0C by 2090-2099. As a consequence of global warming, the period of snow cover is decreasing on several mountain areas. Thermal time approach can be used to characterise the seed germination of plants and to evaluate the germination behaviour under the climate change scenarios. In this study, the effect of different cold stratification periods on seed dormancy release and germination of Gentiana lutea subsp. lutea, a taxon listed in Annex V of the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC), was evaluated. Furthermore, the thermal requirements and the consequences of the temperature rise for seed germination of this species were estimated. In addition, a conceptual representation of the thermal time approach is presented. Methods:Seeds of G. lutea subsp. lutea were harvested from at least 50 randomly selected plants in two representative localities of the Gennargentu massif (Sardinia). Germination tests were carried out under laboratory conditions and the responses at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 \u00b0C were recorded. Different cold stratification pre-treatments at 1 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C (i.e. 0, 15, 30, 60 and 90 days) were applied. Successively, the base temperature (T b) and the number of thermal units (\u03b8, \u00b0Cd) for germination were estimated. Additionally, this study examined the consequences of an increase in temperatures based on the Representative Concentration Pathways (RPC) scenarios. Results:The results indicated that from 0 to 30 days of cold stratification, the germination was null or very low. After 60 and 90 days of cold stratification the seed dormancy was removed; however, 25 and 30 \u00b0C negatively affected the germination capacity of non-dormant seeds. Seeds cold-stratified for 90 days showed a lower T b than those stratified for 60 days. However, 60 and 90 days of cold stratification did not cause great variations in the thermal time units. Analysing the RPC scenarios, we detected that the number of days useful for dormancy release of seeds of G. lutea may be less than 30 days, a condition that does not permit an effective dormancy release. Conclusions:We conclude that seeds of G. lutea need at least 60 days of cold stratification to remove dormancy and promote the germination.

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the global mean surface temperature could increase of approximately 2-4 \u00b0C by 2090-2099. As a consequence of global warming, the period of snow cover is decreasing on several mountain areas. Thermal time approach can be used to characterise the seed germination of plants and to evaluate the germination behaviour under the climate change scenarios. In this study, the effect of different cold stratification periods on seed dormancy release and germination of Gentiana lutea subsp. lutea, a taxon listed in Annex V of the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC), was evaluated. Furthermore, the thermal requirements and the consequences of the temperature rise for seed germination of this species were estimated. In addition, a conceptual representation of the thermal time approach is presented. Methods:Seeds of G. lutea subsp. lutea were harvested from at least 50 randomly selected plants in two representative localities of the Gennargentu massif (Sardinia). Germination tests were carried out under laboratory conditions and the responses at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 \u00b0C were recorded. Different cold stratification pre-treatments at 1 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C (i.e. 0, 15, 30, 60 and 90 days) were applied. Successively, the base temperature (T b) and the number of thermal units (\u03b8, \u00b0Cd) for germination were estimated. Additionally, this study examined the consequences of an increase in temperatures based on the Representative Concentration Pathways (RPC) scenarios. Results:The results indicated that from 0 to 30 days of cold stratification, the germination was null or very low. After 60 and 90 days of cold stratification the seed dormancy was removed; however, 25 and 30 \u00b0C negatively affected the germination capacity of non-dormant seeds. Seeds cold-stratified for 90 days showed a lower T b than those stratified for 60 days. However, 60 and 90 days of cold stratification did not cause great variations in the thermal time units. Analysing the RPC scenarios, we detected that the number of days useful for dormancy release of seeds of G. lutea may be less than 30 days, a condition that does not permit an effective dormancy release. Conclusions:We conclude that seeds of G. lutea need at least 60 days of cold stratification to remove dormancy and promote the germination. The thermal time model developed in this work allowed us to identify the thermal threshold requirements of seed germination of this species, increasing the knowledge of a plant threatened by global warming. Our results emphasise the need for further studies aiming at a better characterisation of germination efficiency, especially for species that require cold stratification.

Here, we quantify a distribution of mitigation effort whereby each country is economically better off than under current climate pledges.

But CMIP5 models based on Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) are 'transient simulations' and cannot reflect the response of climate warming stabilized at 1.5\u2009\u00b0C. The current work presents an assessment of extreme temperature changes in China with simulations from 'Half a degree Additional warming, Prognosis and Projected Impacts' (HAPPI) project specially conceived for global warming levels stabilized at 1.5\u2009\u00b0C and 2.0\u2009\u00b0C. When global warming stabilizes at 1.5\u2009\u00b0C/2.0\u2009\u00b0C, the areal-mean temperature for whole China increases by about 0.94\u2009\u00b0C/1.59\u2009\u00b0C (relative to present period, taken from 2006-2015). Notable increase regions are mainly found in Northwest and Northeast-North China, but warm spell duration increases mostly in Southeast China. The effect of the additional 0.5\u2009\u00b0C warming is particularly investigated and compared between the transient and stabilized simulations.

But CMIP5 models based on Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) are 'transient simulations' and cannot reflect the response of climate warming stabilized at 1.5\u2009\u00b0C. The current work presents an assessment of extreme temperature changes in China with simulations from 'Half a degree Additional warming, Prognosis and Projected Impacts' (HAPPI) project specially conceived for global warming levels stabilized at 1.5\u2009\u00b0C and 2.0\u2009\u00b0C. When global warming stabilizes at 1.5\u2009\u00b0C/2.0\u2009\u00b0C, the areal-mean temperature for whole China increases by about 0.94\u2009\u00b0C/1.59\u2009\u00b0C (relative to present period, taken from 2006-2015). Notable increase regions are mainly found in Northwest and Northeast-North China, but warm spell duration increases mostly in Southeast China. The effect of the additional 0.5\u2009\u00b0C warming is particularly investigated and compared between the transient and stabilized simulations. Changes of mean and extreme temperature are larger in transient simulations than in stabilized simulations. The uncertainty range is also narrower in stabilized simulations. Under stabilized global warming scenario, extreme hot event with return period of 100 years in the present climate becomes event occurring every 4.79 (1.5\u2009\u00b0C warming level) and 1.56 years (2.0\u2009\u00b0C warming level), extreme cold event with return period of 10 years becomes event occurring every 67 years under 1.5\u2009\u00b0C warming and is unlikely to occur under 2.0\u2009\u00b0C warming.

vulnerable to climate variability and change. Global warming is projected to result in higher regional warming and have a strong impact on agriculture. This study specifically examines the impact of global warming levels (GWLs) of 1.5\u00b0, 2\u00b0 and 3 \u00b0C relative to 1971-2000 on crop suitability over West Africa. We used 10 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase5 Global Climate Models (CMIP5 GCMs) downscaled by Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Rossby Centre's regional Atmospheric model version 4, RCA4, to drive Ecocrop, a crop suitability model, for pearl millet, cassava, groundnut, cowpea, maize and plantain. The results show Ecocrop simulated crop suitability spatial representation with higher suitability, observed to the south of latitude 14\u00b0N and lower suitability to its north for 1971-2000 for all crops except for plantain (12\u00b0N). The model also simulates the best three planting months within the growing season from September-August over the past climate. Projected changes in crop suitability under the three GWLs 1.5-3.0 \u00b0C suggest a spatial suitability expansion for legume and cereal crops, notably in the central southern Sahel zone; root and tuber and plantain in the central Guinea-Savanna zone. In contrast, projected decreases in the crop suitability index value are predicted to the south of 14\u00b0N for cereals, root and tuber crops; nevertheless, the areas remain suitable for the crops. A delay of between 1-3 months is projected over the region during the planting month under the three GWLs for legumes, pearl millet and plantain. A two month delay in planting is projected in the south, notably over the Guinea and central Savanna zone with earlier planting of about three months in the Savanna-Sahel zones. The effect of GWL2.0 and GWL3.0 warming in comparison to GWL1.5 \u00b0C are more dramatic on cereals and root and tuber crops, especially cassava. All the projected changes in simulated crop suitability in response to climatic variables are statistically significant at 99% confidence level.

Temperature is an important environmental determinant among the many risk factors for IHD. However, the emerging temperature-related health risks of IHD in the elderly is limited because of the lack of estimates that integrate global warming and demographic change. METHODS:Data on daily IHD deaths in the elderly aged \u226565\u2009years and meteorological conditions were collected in Tianjin, a megacity of China, from 2006 to 2011. First, the baseline relationship between the temperature and years of life lost (YLL) from IHD was established. Then, future assessments were performed in combination with temperature projections for 19 global-scale climate models (GCMs) under 3 representative concentration pathways (RCPs) for the 2050s and 2070s. RESULTS:Increased YLL from IHD in the elderly was found to be associated with future ambient temperatures. The annual temperature-related YLL from IHD in the 2050s and 2070s were higher than the baseline. For instance, increases of 4.5, 14.9 and 38.3% were found under the RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively, in the 2070s. The most significant increases occurred in warm season months. The increase in heat-related YLL will not be completely offset, even with the 25% adaptation assumed.

We characterized the genetic responses of 10 wild emmer wheat (<i>Triticum dicoccoides</i> Koern.; WEW) populations in Israel, sampling them in 1980 and again in 2008, through an exome capture analysis. It was found that these WEW populations were under elevated selection, displayed reduced diversity and temporal divergence, and carried increased mutational burdens forward. However, some populations still showed the ability to acquire beneficial alleles via selection or de novo mutation for future adaptation. Grouping populations with mean annual rainfall and temperature revealed significant differences in most of the 14 genetic estimates in either sampling year or over the 28 y. The patterns of genetic response to rainfall and temperature varied and were complex. In general, temperature groups displayed more temporal differences in genetic response than rainfall groups.

It was found that these WEW populations were under elevated selection, displayed reduced diversity and temporal divergence, and carried increased mutational burdens forward. However, some populations still showed the ability to acquire beneficial alleles via selection or de novo mutation for future adaptation. Grouping populations with mean annual rainfall and temperature revealed significant differences in most of the 14 genetic estimates in either sampling year or over the 28 y. The patterns of genetic response to rainfall and temperature varied and were complex. In general, temperature groups displayed more temporal differences in genetic response than rainfall groups.

On the basis of measurement of rice responses to climate and carbon dioxide concentration ([CO<sub>2</sub>]), the dynamic process model named SIMRIW was developed to predict global warming effects on irrigated rice.

"Background:To study the impact of climate warming on crops, it is crucial to have a warming equipment suitable for their field environment. A facility is needed that can provide suitable combinations of different temperatures at reasonable cost for large plots. Results:Here, an additional field warming facility option named the hot-blast warming facility (HBWF), which comprised heaters, blowers, wind breaks, and a control board was developed. An application case based on HBWF was carried out to assess elevated temperature effects on rice in Central China during 2015 and 2016.

Heating convection air directly, the facility could increase the temperature of the rice canopy up to 1-2 \u00b0C, which could properly simulate global warming.

However, there is evidence for coral adaptive plasticity in the role of epigenetic that have acclimated to high-temperature environments. We have implemented ATAC-seq and RNA-seq to study the cnidarian-dinoflagellate model <i>Exaptasia pallida</i> (Aiptasia) and expose the role of chromatin-dynamics in response to thermal-stress. We have identified 1309 genomic sites that change their accessibility in response to thermal changes.

Although, not a \"true\" hiatus in the strict definition of the word, this has been termed the \"global warming hiatus\" by IPCC (2013). There have been other periods that have also been defined as the \"hiatus\" depending on the analysis. There are a number of uncertainties and knowledge gaps regarding the \"hiatus.\" This report reviews these issues and also posits insights from a collective set of diverse information that helps us understand what we do and do not know.

(CAO) during the last decades than during the past 800,000 years. Brackish brine (fed by meltwater inside the ice) is an expanding sympagic habitat in summer all over the CAO. We report for the first time the structure of bacterial communities in this brine. They are composed of psychrophilic extremophiles, many of them related to phylotypes known from Arctic and Antarctic regions. Community structure displayed strong habitat segregation between brackish ice brine (IB; salinity 2.4-9.6) and immediate sub-ice seawater (SW; salinity 33.3-34.9), expressed at all taxonomic levels (class to genus), by dominant phylotypes as well as by the rare biosphere, and with specialists dominating IB and generalists SW. The dominant phylotypes in IB were related to Candidatus Aquiluna and Flavobacterium, those in SW to Balneatrix and ZD0405, and those shared between the habitats to Halomonas, Polaribacter and Shewanella.

They are composed of psychrophilic extremophiles, many of them related to phylotypes known from Arctic and Antarctic regions. Community structure displayed strong habitat segregation between brackish ice brine (IB; salinity 2.4-9.6) and immediate sub-ice seawater (SW; salinity 33.3-34.9), expressed at all taxonomic levels (class to genus), by dominant phylotypes as well as by the rare biosphere, and with specialists dominating IB and generalists SW. The dominant phylotypes in IB were related to Candidatus Aquiluna and Flavobacterium, those in SW to Balneatrix and ZD0405, and those shared between the habitats to Halomonas, Polaribacter and Shewanella.

Hopkins estimated the progressive delay in tree leaf-out with increasing latitude, longitude, and elevation, referred to as \"Hopkins' bioclimatic law.\" What if global warming is altering this well-known law? Here, based on \u223c20,000 observations of the leaf-out date of four common temperate tree species located in 128 sites at various elevations in the European Alps, we found that the elevation-induced phenological shift (EPS) has significantly declined from 34 d\u22c51,000 m<sup>-1</sup> conforming to Hopkins' bioclimatic law in 1960, to 22 d\u22c51,000 m<sup>-1</sup> in 2016, i.e., -35%. The stronger phenological advance at higher elevations, responsible for the reduction in EPS, is most likely to be connected to stronger warming during late spring as well as to warmer winter temperatures.

However, to what extent, and for whom, is danger avoided if this ambitious target is realized? We address these questions by scrutinizing heat stress, because the frequency of extremely hot weather is expected to continue to rise in the approach to the 2 \u00b0C limit. We use analogs and the extreme South Asian heat of 2015 as a focusing event to help interpret the increasing frequency of deadly heat under specified amounts of global warming. Using a large ensemble of climate models, our results confirm that global mean air temperature is nonlinearly related to heat stress, meaning that the same future warming as realized to date could trigger larger increases in societal impacts than historically experienced. This nonlinearity is higher for heat stress metrics that integrate the effect of rising humidity.

However, to what extent, and for whom, is danger avoided if this ambitious target is realized? We address these questions by scrutinizing heat stress, because the frequency of extremely hot weather is expected to continue to rise in the approach to the 2 \u00b0C limit. We use analogs and the extreme South Asian heat of 2015 as a focusing event to help interpret the increasing frequency of deadly heat under specified amounts of global warming. Using a large ensemble of climate models, our results confirm that global mean air temperature is nonlinearly related to heat stress, meaning that the same future warming as realized to date could trigger larger increases in societal impacts than historically experienced. This nonlinearity is higher for heat stress metrics that integrate the effect of rising humidity. We show that, even in a climate held to 2 \u00b0C above PI, Karachi (Pakistan) and Kolkata (India) could expect conditions equivalent to their deadly 2015 heatwaves every year. With only 1.5 \u00b0C of global warming, twice as many megacities (such as Lagos, Nigeria, and Shanghai, China) could become heat stressed, exposing more than 350 million more people to deadly heat by 2050 under a midrange population growth scenario.

Our understanding of climate change impacts on marine ecosystems is largely limited to the open ocean, mainly because coastal upwelling is poorly reproduced by current earth system models. Here, a high-resolution model is used to examine the response of nutrients and plankton dynamics to future climate change in the California Current System (CCS). The results show increased upwelling intensity associated with stronger alongshore winds in the coastal region, and enhanced upper-ocean stratification in both the CCS and open ocean. Warming of the open ocean forces isotherms downwards, where they make contact with water masses with higher nutrient concentrations, thereby enhancing the nutrient flux to the deep source waters of the CCS.

Our understanding of climate change impacts on marine ecosystems is largely limited to the open ocean, mainly because coastal upwelling is poorly reproduced by current earth system models. Here, a high-resolution model is used to examine the response of nutrients and plankton dynamics to future climate change in the California Current System (CCS). The results show increased upwelling intensity associated with stronger alongshore winds in the coastal region, and enhanced upper-ocean stratification in both the CCS and open ocean. Warming of the open ocean forces isotherms downwards, where they make contact with water masses with higher nutrient concentrations, thereby enhancing the nutrient flux to the deep source waters of the CCS. Increased winds and eddy activity further facilitate upward nutrient transport to the euphotic zone.

However, instrumental data shows a global-warming hiatus between the late-1990s and 2015. It is presently not clear how the global-warming hiatus affects modes of climate variability such as the IOD, and their basin-wide ocean-atmosphere teleconnections. Here, we present a 26-year long, biweekly record of Sr/Ca and \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O from a Porites coral drilled in the Gulf of Oman. Sea surface temperature (SST<sub>anom</sub>) is calculated from Sr/Ca ratios, and seawater \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O (\u03b4<sup>18</sup>O<sub>sw-anom</sub>) is estimated by subtracting the temperature component from coral \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O. Our \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O<sub>sw-anom</sub> record reveals a significant regime shift in 1999, towards lower mean \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O<sub>sw</sub> values, reflecting intensified upwelling in the western Indian Ocean. Prior to the 1999 regime shift, our SST<sub>anom</sub> and \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O<sub>sw-anom</sub> show a clear IOD signature, with higher values in the summer of positive-IOD years due to weakened upwelling.

However, instrumental data shows a global-warming hiatus between the late-1990s and 2015. It is presently not clear how the global-warming hiatus affects modes of climate variability such as the IOD, and their basin-wide ocean-atmosphere teleconnections. Here, we present a 26-year long, biweekly record of Sr/Ca and \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O from a Porites coral drilled in the Gulf of Oman. Sea surface temperature (SST<sub>anom</sub>) is calculated from Sr/Ca ratios, and seawater \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O (\u03b4<sup>18</sup>O<sub>sw-anom</sub>) is estimated by subtracting the temperature component from coral \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O. Our \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O<sub>sw-anom</sub> record reveals a significant regime shift in 1999, towards lower mean \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O<sub>sw</sub> values, reflecting intensified upwelling in the western Indian Ocean. Prior to the 1999 regime shift, our SST<sub>anom</sub> and \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O<sub>sw-anom</sub> show a clear IOD signature, with higher values in the summer of positive-IOD years due to weakened upwelling.

This would minimize synergistic impacts attributable to dams plus global warming, and help ensure the continued provision of ecosystem services represented by the Lower Mekong fishery.", "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4988766?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "PloS one", "authorinfo": ["Kano Y", "Dudgeon D", "Nam S", "Samejima H", "Watanabe K", "Grudpan C", "Grudpan J", "Magtoon W", "Musikasinthorn P", "Nguyen PT", "Praxaysonbath B", "Sato T", "Shibukawa K", "Shimatani Y", "Suvarnaraksha A", "Tanaka W", "Thach P", "Tran DD", "Yamashita T", "Utsugi K"], "title": "Impacts of Dams and Global Warming on Fish Biodiversity in the Indo-Burma Hotspot."}, "PMC6044228": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "29849111", "source": "MED", "pmid": "29849111", "pmcid": "PMC6044228", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC6044228"}, "doi": "10.1038/s41598-018-26883-7", "title": "Publisher Correction: Impaired photosynthesis and increased leaf construction costs may induce floral stress during episodes of global warming over macroevolutionary timescales.", "authorString": "Haworth M, Belcher CM, Killi D, Dewhirst RA, Materassi A, Raschi A, Centritto M.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Haworth M", "firstName": "Matthew", "lastName": "Haworth", "initials": "M", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-3225-6620"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "The Italian National Research Council - Tree and Timber Institute (CNR-IVALSA), Via Madonna del Piano 10, Sesto Fiorentino, 50019, Florence, Italy. haworth@ivalsa.cnr.it."}}}, {"fullName": "Belcher CM", "firstName": "Claire M", "lastName": "Belcher", "initials": "CM", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "University of Exeter wildFIRE Lab, Hatherly Labs Prince Wales Road Exeter, EX PS, Devon, England."}}}, {"fullName": "Killi D", "firstName": "Dilek", "lastName": "Killi", "initials": "D", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Agrifood Production and Environmental Sciences (DiSPAA), University of Florence Piazzale delle Cascine, 28 50144, Florence, Italy."}}}, {"fullName": "Dewhirst RA", "firstName": "Rebecca A", "lastName": "Dewhirst", "initials": "RA", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "University of Exeter wildFIRE Lab, Hatherly Labs Prince Wales Road Exeter, EX PS, Devon, England."}}}, {"fullName": "Materassi A", "firstName": "Alessandro", "lastName": "Materassi", "initials": "A", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "The Italian National Research Council - Institute of Biometeorology (CNR-IBIMET), Via Giovanni Caproni, 8 50145, Florence, Italy."}}}, {"fullName": "Raschi A", "firstName": "Antonio", "lastName": "Raschi", "initials": "A", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "The Italian National Research Council - Institute of Biometeorology (CNR-IBIMET), Via Giovanni Caproni, 8 50145, Florence, Italy."}}}, {"fullName": "Centritto M", "firstName": "Mauro", "lastName": "Centritto", "initials": "M", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "The Italian National Research Council - Tree and Timber Institute (CNR-IVALSA), Via Madonna del Piano 10, Sesto Fiorentino, 50019, Florence, Italy."}}}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-3225-6620"}}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": "altmetrics"}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "1", "volume": "8", "journalIssueId": "2677898", "dateOfPublication": "2018 May", "monthOfPublication": "5", "yearOfPublication": "2018", "printPublicationDate": "2018-05-01", "journal": {"title": "Scientific reports", "ISOAbbreviation": "Sci Rep", "medlineAbbreviation": "Sci Rep", "NLMid": "101563288", "ISSN": "2045-2322", "ESSN": "2045-2322"}}, "pubYear": "2018", "pageInfo": "8661", "abstractText": "A correction to this article has been published and is linked from the HTML and PDF versions of this paper.

Further results indicate that the decreasing temperature was compensated by the accelerated drying trends of soil moisture and enhanced ET, leading to an acceleration of flash droughts during the warming hiatus. The anthropogenic warming in the next few decades may exacerbate future flash drought conditions in China.", "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4980985?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Scientific reports", "authorinfo": ["Wang L", "Yuan X", "Xie Z", "Wu P", "Li Y"], "title": "Increasing flash droughts over China during the recent global warming hiatus."}, "PMC5517487": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "28724987", "source": "MED", "pmid": "28724987", "pmcid": "PMC5517487", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC5517487"}, "doi": "10.1038/s41598-017-06302-z", "title": "The asymmetric impact of global warming on US drought types and distributions in a large ensemble of 97 hydro-climatic simulations.", "authorString": "Huang S, Leng G, Huang Q, Xie Y, Liu S, Meng E, Li P.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Huang S", "firstName": "Shengzhi", "lastName": "Huang", "initials": "S", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Base of Eco-Hydraulic Engineering in Arid Area, Xi'an University of Technology, Xi'an, 710048, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Leng G", "firstName": "Guoyong", "lastName": "Leng", "initials": "G", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-6345-143X"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Joint Global Change Research Institute, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, College Park MD, USA.

Cotton fiber is an essential raw material for the textile industry. Fiber length, which was found negatively related to the excessively high temperature, determines yarn quality to a great extent. To investigate the effects of global warming on cotton fiber length and its mechaism, cottons grown in artificially elevated temperature (34.6/30.5\u2009\u00b0C, T<sub>day</sub>/T<sub>night</sub>) and ambient temperature (31.6/27.3\u2009\u00b0C) regions have been investigated.

We recommend the WNPSH be measured by eddy geopotential height (He) instead of traditionally used geopotential height, especially in climate change studies.", "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4660429?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Scientific reports", "authorinfo": ["He C", "Zhou T", "Lin A", "Wu B", "Gu D", "Li C", "Zheng B"], "title": "Enhanced or Weakened Western North Pacific Subtropical High under Global Warming?"}, "PMC6049339": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "29670149", "source": "MED", "pmid": "29670149", "pmcid": "PMC6049339", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC6049339"}, "doi": "10.1038/s41598-018-24459-z", "title": "Impaired photosynthesis and increased leaf construction costs may induce floral stress during episodes of global warming over macroevolutionary timescales.", "authorString": "Haworth M, Belcher CM, Killi D, Dewhirst RA, Materassi A, Raschi A, Centritto M.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Haworth M", "firstName": "Matthew", "lastName": "Haworth", "initials": "M", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-3225-6620"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "The Italian National Research Council - Tree and Timber Institute (CNR-IVALSA) Via Madonna del Piano 10, Sesto Fiorentino, 50019, Florence, Italy. haworth@ivalsa.cnr.it."}}}, {"fullName": "Belcher CM", "firstName": "Claire M", "lastName": "Belcher", "initials": "CM", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "University of Exeter wildFIRE Lab, Hatherly Labs Prince Wales Road Exeter, EX PS, Devon, England."}}}, {"fullName": "Killi D", "firstName": "Dilek", "lastName": "Killi", "initials": "D", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Agrifood Production and Environmental Sciences (DiSPAA), University of Florence Piazzale delle Cascine, 28 50144, Florence, Italy."}}}, {"fullName": "Dewhirst RA", "firstName": "Rebecca A", "lastName": "Dewhirst", "initials": "RA", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-8651-2426"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "University of Exeter wildFIRE Lab, Hatherly Labs Prince Wales Road Exeter, EX PS, Devon, England."}}}, {"fullName": "Materassi A", "firstName": "Alessandro", "lastName": "Materassi", "initials": "A", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "The Italian National Research Council - Institute of Biometeorology (CNR-IBIMET) Via Giovanni Caproni, 8 50145, Florence, Italy."}}}, {"fullName": "Raschi A", "firstName": "Antonio", "lastName": "Raschi", "initials": "A", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "The Italian National Research Council - Institute of Biometeorology (CNR-IBIMET) Via Giovanni Caproni, 8 50145, Florence, Italy."}}}, {"fullName": "Centritto M", "firstName": "Mauro", "lastName": "Centritto", "initials": "M", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "The Italian National Research Council - Tree and Timber Institute (CNR-IVALSA) Via Madonna del Piano 10, Sesto Fiorentino, 50019, Florence, Italy."}}}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": [{"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-8651-2426"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-3225-6620"}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": ["supporting_data", "altmetrics"]}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "1", "volume": "8", "journalIssueId": "2668385", "dateOfPublication": "2018 Apr", "monthOfPublication": "4", "yearOfPublication": "2018", "printPublicationDate": "2018-04-01", "journal": {"title": "Scientific reports", "ISOAbbreviation": "Sci Rep", "medlineAbbreviation": "Sci Rep", "NLMid": "101563288", "ISSN": "2045-2322", "ESSN": "2045-2322"}}, "pubYear": "2018", "pageInfo": "6206", "abstractText": "Global warming events have coincided with turnover of plant species at intervals in Earth history.

Global warming and AMOC-induced NH cooling are governed by similar feedbacks, giving rise to a global net radiative imbalance of similar sign, although the former is associated with surface warming, the latter with cooling. Their footprints in outgoing longwave and absorbed shortwave radiation are very distinct, making attribution possible.", "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4594299?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Scientific reports", "title": "Competition between global warming and an abrupt collapse of the AMOC in Earth's energy imbalance."}, "PMC5502054": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "28781394", "source": "MED", "pmid": "28781394", "pmcid": "PMC5502054", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC5502054"}, "doi": "10.1007/s11192-017-2405-z", "title": "Slow reception and under-citedness in climate change research: A case study of Charles David Keeling, discoverer of the risk of global warming.", "authorString": "Marx W, Haunschild R, French B, Bornmann L.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Marx W", "firstName": "Werner", "lastName": "Marx", "initials": "W", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-1763-5753"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research, Heisenbergstra\u00dfe 1, 70569 Stuttgart, Germany."}}}, {"fullName": "Haunschild R", "firstName": "Robin", "lastName": "Haunschild", "initials": "R", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-7025-7256"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research, Heisenbergstra\u00dfe 1, 70569 Stuttgart, Germany."}}}, {"fullName": "French B", "firstName": "Bernie", "lastName": "French", "initials": "B", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "CAS Innovation LAB, CAS (Chemical Abstracts Service), a division of the American Chemical Society, 2540 Olentangy River Road, Columbus, OH 43202-1505 USA."}}}, {"fullName": "Bornmann L", "firstName": "Lutz", "lastName": "Bornmann", "initials": "L", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Division for Science and Innovation Studies, Administrative Headquarters of the Max Planck Society, Hofgartenstr. 8, 80539 Munich, Germany."}}}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": [{"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-7025-7256"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-1763-5753"}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": ["supporting_data", "altmetrics"]}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "2", "volume": "112", "journalIssueId": "2839343", "dateOfPublication": "2017", "monthOfPublication": "0", "yearOfPublication": "2017", "printPublicationDate": "2017-01-01", "journal": {"title": "Scientometrics", "ISOAbbreviation": "Scientometrics", "medlineAbbreviation": "Scientometrics", "NLMid": "7901197", "ISSN": "0138-9130"}}, "pubYear": "2017", "pageInfo": "1079-1092", "abstractText": "The Keeling curve has become a chemical landmark, whereas the papers by Charles David Keeling about the underlying carbon dioxide measurements are not cited as often as can be expected against the backdrop of his final approval.

The regional precipitation projections for global warming of 1.5\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C are uncertain, but the eastern US is projected to experience wetter winters and the Great Plains and the Northwest US are projected to experience drier summers in the future. The impact of different scenarios on regional precipitation projections is negligible throughout the twenty-first century compared to uncertainties associated with internal variability and model

Although warming was only lethal for the mosquitoes, it reduced predation rates on these prey. Possibly, under warming escape speeds of the mosquitoes increased more than the attack efficiency of the predators. Endosulfan imposed mortality and induced behavioral changes (including increased filtering and thrashing and a positional shift away from the bottom) in mosquito larvae. Although the pesticide was only lethal for the mosquitoes, it reduced predation rates by the low-latitude predators. This can be explained by the combination of the evolution of a faster life history and associated higher vulnerabilities to the pesticide (in terms of growth rate and lowered foraging activity) in the low-latitude predators and pesticide-induced survival selection in the mosquitoes.

Possibly, under warming escape speeds of the mosquitoes increased more than the attack efficiency of the predators. Endosulfan imposed mortality and induced behavioral changes (including increased filtering and thrashing and a positional shift away from the bottom) in mosquito larvae. Although the pesticide was only lethal for the mosquitoes, it reduced predation rates by the low-latitude predators. This can be explained by the combination of the evolution of a faster life history and associated higher vulnerabilities to the pesticide (in terms of growth rate and lowered foraging activity) in the low-latitude predators and pesticide-induced survival selection in the mosquitoes. Our results suggest that predation rates on mosquitoes at the high latitude will be reduced under warming unless predators evolve toward the current low-latitude phenotype or low-latitude predators move poleward.", "Keywords": ["Climate change", "Biological control", "Latitudinal gradient", "Contaminants", "Life History Evolution", "Range Shifts", "Thermal Evolution", "Ischnura Elegans"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4908467?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Evolutionary applications", "authorinfo": ["Tran TT", "Janssens L", "Dinh KV", "Op de Beeck L", "Stoks R"], "title": "Evolution determines how global warming and pesticide exposure will shape predator-prey interactions with vector mosquitoes."}, "PMC4275269": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "25535973", "source": "MED", "pmid": "25535973", "pmcid": "PMC4275269", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC4275269"}, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0115655", "title": "Global warming and mass mortalities of benthic invertebrates in the Mediterranean Sea.", "authorString": "Rivetti I, Fraschetti S, Lionello P, Zambianchi E, Boero F.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Rivetti I", "firstName": "Irene", "lastName": "Rivetti", "initials": "I", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Dipartimento di Scienze e Tecnologie Biologiche ed Ambientali, Universit\u00e0 del Salento, CoNISMa, Lecce, Italy."}}}, {"fullName": "Fraschetti S", "firstName": "Simonetta", "lastName": "Fraschetti", "initials": "S", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-1780-1651"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Dipartimento di Scienze e Tecnologie Biologiche ed Ambientali, Universit\u00e0 del Salento, CoNISMa, Lecce, Italy."}}}, {"fullName": "Lionello P", "firstName": "Piero", "lastName": "Lionello", "initials": "P", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-0779-5681"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Dipartimento di Scienze e Tecnologie Biologiche ed Ambientali, Universit\u00e0 del Salento, CoNISMa, Lecce, Italy; CMCC Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change, Lecce, Italy."}}}, {"fullName": "Zambianchi E", "firstName": "Enrico", "lastName": "Zambianchi", "initials": "E", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-5474-7466"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Dipartimento di Scienze per l'Ambiente, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Napoli \"Parthenope\", CoNISMa, Napoli, Italy."}}}, {"fullName": "Boero F", "firstName": "Ferdinando", "lastName": "Boero", "initials": "F", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-6317-2710"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Dipartimento di Scienze e Tecnologie Biologiche ed Ambientali, Universit\u00e0 del Salento, CoNISMa, Lecce, Italy; CMCC Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change, Lecce, Italy; Istituto di Scienze Marine del CNR, Genova, Italy."}}}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": [{"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-5474-7466"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-0779-5681"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-1780-1651"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-6317-2710"}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": ["supporting_data", "altmetrics"]}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "12", "volume": "9", "journalIssueId": "2245233", "dateOfPublication": "2014", "monthOfPublication": "0", "yearOfPublication": "2014", "printPublicationDate": "2014-01-01", "journal": {"title": "PloS one", "ISOAbbreviation": "PLoS One", "medlineAbbreviation": "PLoS One", "NLMid": "101285081", "ISSN": "1932-6203", "ESSN": "1932-6203"}}, "pubYear": "2014", "pageInfo": "e115655", "abstractText": "Satellite data show a steady increase, in the last decades, of the surface temperature (upper few millimetres of the water surface) of the Mediterranean Sea.
