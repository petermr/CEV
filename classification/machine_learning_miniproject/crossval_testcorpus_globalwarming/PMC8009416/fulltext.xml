Yet few studies have examined changes over time in the elevational distribution of species along fragmented gradients in response to global warming. Here, we report on a resurvey of an understory bird community in the Usambara Mountains in Tanzania, along a forested elevational gradient that has been fragmented over the last 200 years. In 2019, we resurveyed seven sites, ranging in elevation from 360 m to 2110 m, that were originally surveyed between 1979 and 1981. We calculated differences in mean elevation and lower and upper range limits for 29 species between the two time periods and corrected for possible differences in elevation due to chance. Over four decades, we documented a significant mean upslope shift across species of 93 m. This shift was smaller than the 125 m expected shift due to local climate warming. Of the 29 focal species, 19 shifted upslope, eight downslope, and two remained unchanged. Mean upslope shifts in species were driven largely by contracting lower range limits which moved significantly upslope on average across species by 183 m, while upper range limits shifted non-significantly upslope by 72 m, leading to a mean range contraction of 114 m across species. Community composition of understory bird species also shifted over time, with current communities resembling communities found historically at lower elevations. Past forest fragmentation in combination with the limited gap-crossing ability of many tropical understory bird species are very likely important contributory factors to the observed asymmetrical shifts in lower and upper elevational range limits. Re-establishing forested linkages among the largest and closest forest fragments in the Eastern Arc Mountains are critical to permitting species to shift upslope and to reduce further elevational range contractions over time.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>JRS Biodiversity Foundation</institution></funding-source><award-id>#60708_TAWIRI</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9753-6765</contrib-id><name><surname>Neate-Clegg</surname><given-names>Montague H.

Consequently many tropical montane species are threatened by climate change [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].

The impacts of habitat loss and fragmentation on tropical bird communities are well-documented [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However the combined impacts of climate change and habitat loss on tropical birds are less well-understood although potentially devastating [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248712.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. There have been far fewer studies of climate change effects on tropical bird species compared to temperate species [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Furthermore, most studies of elevational range shifts of bird communities in the tropics have been conducted along elevational gradients in continuous forest [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248712.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248712.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Consequently, there has been little research assessing how climate-induced elevational shifts of species are impacted in fragmented forests.</p><p>Across a species&#x02019; elevational range, changes over time in lower and upper elevational range limits are a result of range contractions and expansions. Upslope shifts in the lower elevational range of a species represent a population contraction along the trailing edge of a species&#x02019; range [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], with areas that were formerly suitable becoming unsuitable. On the other hand, upslope shifts in the upper elevational range limit represent a range expansion and necessitate colonization. Although new areas at higher elevations may over time become ecologically suitable for a species, such areas may not be colonized if individuals are unable to reach them [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248712.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248712.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. If upslope shifts in the lower elevational range limit exceed upslope shifts in the upper elevational range limit this results in a range contraction.</p><p>Forest fragmentation can alter elevational range shifts of species in response to global warming through a restriction of species dispersal. For species with low dispersal capability, upslope shifts in response to climate change will very likely be more constrained in fragmented than in continuous forested landscapes. Many tropical understory bird species have very low dispersal and gap-crossing ability [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248712.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248712.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] compared to their temperate counterparts. Consequently, colonizing newly-suitable habitats at higher elevations separated by forest gaps may be particularly problematic for many understory bird species. As a result upper elevational range limits for many tropical understory bird species may shift minimally in response to global warming while lower range boundaries may contract leading to a compression in elevational ranges [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248712.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Alternatively, forest fragmentation may reduce competitively-driven upslope shifts of species due to the inability of lowland species to disperse to higher elevation fragments [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Most research on elevational range shifts of bird species over time in the tropics has been conducted in the Neotropics [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248712.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248712.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248712.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and Southeast Asia [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248712.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248712.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. There has been relatively little research in the Afrotropics (but see: [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]). This is salient because most montane forests in Africa are isolated from one another and continuous elevational gradients have often received incomplete protection [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248712.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. For example, the 13 Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania and Kenya are separated on average by tens to hundreds of kilometers [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Such distances preclude dispersal of forest-dependent species with low dispersal ability [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248712.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248712.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Furthermore, within the Eastern Arc Mountains, forests are extensively fragmented [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248712.g001">Fig 1</xref>). While there is some evidence that climate change may be altering the elevational distribution of Afrotropical birds in montane habitats [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], there has been little assessment of elevational shifts of species over defined time periods.</p><fig id="pone.0248712.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0248712.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Natural forest cover and location of 1980 and 2019 survey sites in the East and West Usambara Mountains in northeast Tanzania.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0248712.g001"/></fig><p>Here, we repeat a historical elevational transect of understory bird species conducted between 1979 and 1981 along a fragmented gradient in the East and West Usambara Mountains in northeast Tanzania (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248712.g001">Fig 1</xref>). We assess shifts over time in the elevational distributions of species by calculating range shifts of species&#x02019; mean elevations as well as shifts in species&#x02019; lower and upper range limits. We then compare observed shifts to expected shifts due to climate warming. Finally, we examine changes over time in community composition along an elevational gradient. In the absence of habitat fragmentation, we would expect species&#x02019; elevational ranges to shift upslope over time. However, as a result of habitat fragmentation in the East and West Usambara Mountains, and based on observed elevational range shifts of species in these mountains, we predict that lower elevational range limits should shift upslope faster than upper elevational range limits resulting in a range contraction across species in comparison to tropical montane species occurring in continuously forested landscapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248712.g002">Fig 2</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0248712.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0248712.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Predicted elevational range shifts of species over time in response to global warming in continuous versus fragmented forest.</title><p>Yellow and pink lines illustrate the upper and lower elevational range limits of a species, respectively.

The elevation of survey sites was derived from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for Tanzania.</p><p>In the 2019 resurvey, we replicated historical sampling methods. At each location, we erected a single line of mist nets (12m x 2 m, 36 mm mesh) of equivalent length (100 m, 190 m, and 380 m; <xref rid="pone.0248712.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) as conducted in the historical survey. All mist net lines ran perpendicular to the forest edge and began 100 m from the forest edge, with the exception of the mist net line at the 360 m elevation site that began at the edge. Mist net lines were operated from dawn to dusk (12 hours) over five continuous days and all captured birds were banded and standard morphometric measurements recorded. Although the historical survey was conducted over a ten-day period at each location, because of the high drop-off in capture rate over time, the resurvey effort was limited to five days per site. Consequently, we restricted the analysis of the historical survey data to the first five days of that survey.

For each time period and species, we calculated mean elevation, and the 2.5% and 97.5% elevational range quantiles to define the &#x0201c;lower&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;upper&#x0201d; range limits, respectively. Percent quantiles are preferable to the minimum and maximum values of elevation in assessing lower and upper range limits because they are less influenced by individual outliers and incorporate all data. In calculating a species&#x02019; elevational shift over time, we subtracted historic elevation values from current values. In calculating upper range limit shifts across species, we excluded all species that were recorded at the highest elevation site (2110 m) during both surveys because for these species it is not possible to detect upslope shifts in upper range limits [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Similarly, in calculating lower range limit shifts we excluded all species that were recorded at the lowest elevation site (360 m) during both surveys. We did, however, incorporate species&#x02019; maximum and minimum recorded elevational range records in each of the two surveys in assessing number and proportion of elevational range shifts that occurred within continuous versus fragmented forest because the 2.5% and 97.5% elevational range quantiles are calculated rather than observed values. For those species whose maximum or minimum recorded elevation were higher in 2019 than 1980, we calculated the proportion of species for which this change occurred within contiguous versus fragmented forest.</p><p>We then assessed across species whether shifts differed significantly from 0 using a weighted two-tailed t-test (&#x0201c;wtd.t.test&#x0201d; from package <italic>weights</italic>) weighted by log number of captures. We used a weighted t-test rather than a conventional t-test because species&#x02019; sample sizes varied widely ranging from 2 to 84 captures. Estimates of elevational range shifts for species with large sample sizes are more reliable [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and hence are given greater weight under a weighted t-test, but log-transforming sample sizes ensured that the t-statistics were not excessively weighted towards a few species with large sample sizes [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>However, a detection of a difference in elevation between two time periods may be spurious, particularly if numbers of captures of individuals differ between time periods. We therefore conducted Monte Carlo simulations to generate differences in elevational range expected by chance alone [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In this simulation, we first pooled captures of all species across both time periods for each site, and then randomly assorted captures to each time period, keeping total captures during each period constant. For example, if 100 individual birds were captured in the historical survey at the 1020 m site, and 60 individuals were captured there in the resurvey, we combined captures from the two periods and then randomly selected without replacement 100 and 60 individuals from this combined pool to create a sample. From this randomized dataset, we calculated the difference in mean elevation and upper and lower range limits between the two periods for each species as above. We repeated this process 1000 times to construct a distribution of expected differences in elevation by species and then calculated the mean and 95% confidence intervals for these simulated distributions. If observed shifts fell outside the 95% confidence intervals of the expected differences, then a species was deemed to have shifted. We then calculated corrected shifts by subtracting expected shifts from observed shifts. Finally, we conducted a weighted two-tailed t-test on corrected shifts to assess whether they differed significantly from 0.</p><p>To assess how closely bird species were tracking temperature change over time, we first calculated changes in annual mean temperature (1979&#x02013;2019) derived from monthly mean temperature data available at half-degree grid cell resolution from the Climatic Research Unit, University of East Anglia [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] for the four 0.5&#x000b0; x 0.5&#x000b0; grid cells that overlap the seven study sites. We then took the average value for these four grid cells for each year and used a linear model to estimate annual temperature change. To calculate the expected distance of upslope shift required to match the increase in local temperature, we combined the annual change in temperature with the known lapse rate of 0.68&#x000b0;C per 100 m for the Usambara Mountains [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].

We found across 29 species in the East and West Usambara Mountains that the mean elevational range shifted upslope by 93 m over a 39-year period which is equivalent to 2.4 m/yr.

Thus, there would appear to be few species traits that are associated with upslope shifts across species, although rigorously assessing species traits is problematic due to sample size (n = 29). These results are consistent with a lack of pattern in species traits associated with shifts observed in the Neotropics and Southeast Asia [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248712.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248712.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], although in the Albertine Rift of Rwanda shift rates in tropical birds have been associated with avian body size [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The association between shift rates and species traits clearly warrants further investigation across the tropics.</p><p>In this study, of the 27 species that shifted their mean elevational range, eight species (28%) shifted their mean elevational range downslope. This proportion is similar to that observed in the Neotropics and Southeast Asia [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248712.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248712.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] where one-fifth to one-third of species have been observed to shift their mean elevational ranges downslope. The general consistency of this pattern across the tropics suggests that factors other than increasing temperature <italic>per se</italic> are important drivers of elevational range shifts for many species [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248712.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Determinants of the elevational range limits of birds are complex [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and individual species can respond very differently to climate change [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Temperature- and precipitation-induced changes in habitat structure [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248712.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], food availability [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], natural enemies [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], and competition [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248712.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248712.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] have all been shown to influence range limits in birds [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. A better mechanistic understanding of the interplay between these factors [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] is obviously required to more accurately predict the responses of tropical bird species to climate change and comparisons of species responses across the tropics may be useful and should provide additional insights.</p><p>In this study, the average rate at which the lower elevational range limit shifted upslope across species (182.8 m, 4.7 m/yr) was 2.5 times faster than that of the upper elevational range limit (71.8 m, 1.8 m/yr). As a result, the elevational ranges of bird species in the Usambara Mountains contracted on average by 114.4 m over the 39-year period. Along continuously forested gradients in New Guinea and Peru, lower elevational range limits of species shifted at a lower rate (New Guinea: 2.0&#x02013;2.8 m/yr, Peru: 3.7 m/yr), whereas upper elevational range limits of species shifted at a higher rate (New Guinea: 2.4&#x02013;3.5 m/yr, Peru: 2.1 m/yr) than in the Usambara Mountains, consistent with the prediction of elevational range contractions of bird species in fragmented forest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248712.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Some caution is warranted in comparing precise shift rates because of the slightly different methods that were used to calculate lower and upper range limits. Yet most notably in these latter studies, which were conducted in continuous forest, elevational ranges did not contract on average across species unlike in the Usambara Mountains. This pattern is also consistent with predictions of elevational range shifts of species in continuous versus fragmented forest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248712.g002">Fig 2</xref>).</p><p>Several factors may have contributed to the differential shift rates in lower and upper elevational range limits and resulting range contractions of bird species in the Usambara Mountains. In this study we observed that five of the six (83%) upslope shifts in species&#x02019; maximum elevations occurred within a forest block (i.e. continuous forest) between 1820 m and 2110 m. In contrast, over the 39-year study period, we documented only one species, Little Greenbul (<italic>Eurillas virens</italic>), shifting upslope over time between forest blocks. The Little Greenbul is an edge-tolerant species [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] that has previously been documented in the Usambara Mountains to readily cross forest gaps [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. On the other hand, of the 14 species whose minimum elevations shifted upslope, 71% of these observed shifts occurred across one or more forest blocks, indicating a population contraction along the trailing edge of these species&#x02019; elevational ranges. This difference suggests different processes are impacting species&#x02019; leading and trailing elevational range boundaries.</p><p>In continuous forest, upslope shifts in species&#x02019; upper and lower range boundaries are unconstrained by forest gaps [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In contrast, in fragmented forest, forest gaps can represent a serious barrier to species dispersal. Over the last 200&#x02013;300 years, forests in the East and West Usambara Mountains have been highly fragmented by human activities [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248712.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248712.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The mean distance (&#x000b1; SD) between the forest blocks included in this study is 13.9 km &#x000b1; 10.3 km (Table1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248712.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Furthermore, long-term monitoring of understory bird species in the East and West Usambara Mountains has indicated very limited dispersal ability for most species [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248712.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. At the 1020 and 1310 m study sites, understory bird species have been surveyed annually over 34 years across a network of 14 forest fragments [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248712.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Over this time period and based on &#x0003e;31,500 captures and 4.43 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> m-mistnet-hrs, 21% of all understory bird species have never been recorded within a study fragment other than where they were originally banded [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The reluctance and/or inability of these species to cross forest gaps in the Usambara Mountains has been further confirmed through detailed radio-tracking and foraging observations in matrix habitats [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248712.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Radio-tracking of four understory bird species with negligible gap-crossing ability over an eight-year period recorded no bird ever crossing a non-forested gap &#x0003e;15 m [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248712.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Limited gap-crossing capacity and dispersal ability have also been observed among many other tropical bird species in other regions [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248712.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248712.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248712.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248712.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].</p><p>For those bird species in the Usambara Mountains which have been documented to cross forest gaps, mean distance of movement between forest fragments is &#x0003c;150 m assuming a bird &#x02018;leap-frogged&#x02019; across the landscape (which is how radio-tagged birds in translocation experiments in the tropics have been observed moving through matrix habitats) or 360 m assuming a bird flew in a straight line between forest fragments [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. While selected understory bird species with good dispersal capability [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] may be able to disperse upslope over time by leap-frogging between small forest fragments, the distance between the remaining small forest fragments is still large relative to the dispersal ability of many species. The median distance between forest fragments &#x0003e;10 ha in size in the East and West Usambara Mountains is 581 m and 1387 m, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. And even if individual species are capable of dispersing upslope between forest blocks, establishing a population may be inhibited by an absence of attracting conspecifics [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248712.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] and/or by Allee effects [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248712.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Consequently, there are clearly multiple ecological constraints preventing species from shifting their upper elevational ranges upslope in fragmented forest in the East and West Usambara Mountains.</p><p>In contrast to upslope shifts in species&#x02019; upper elevational range limits, upslope shifts in the lower elevational range limits of species in fragmented landscapes are unconstrained by colonization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248712.g002">Fig 2</xref>) as they represent the loss of individuals from trailing edge habitats. Nonetheless, it is possible that forest gaps may act as an impediment to lowland competitors and/or natural enemies that may constrain the lower elevational limits of bird populations [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. For example, if the lower elevational limit of a species is a result of interspecific competition [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248712.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], and a competitor is unable to disperse upslope because of a forest gap, this could also alter species shift rates. However, unlike in regions such as the Andes where parapatric species replacements are common [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], in the Usambara Mountains there are very few parapatric species pairs. Thus, there is less evidence to suggest that reduced interspecific competition may be influencing lower limit shift rates. On the other hand, habitat fragmentation will almost certainly exacerbate impacts of global warming on shift rates of understory bird species along their lower elevational range limits via lag effects between past habitat loss and species responses [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] as well as edge effects on habitat selection and nest survival [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248712.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Fragmentation will therefore almost certainly amplify the impacts of global warming on population declines of tropical montane bird species along their trailing edge [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248712.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Over the next four decades, annual mean temperatures across Tanzania are projected to increase by 1.0 to 2.7&#x000b0;C [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Understory bird species in the Usambara Mountains would consequently be projected to shift their mean elevational range upslope by 114&#x02013;310 m and their lower elevational range limit upslope by 215&#x02013;581 m in order to track local temperatures while upper elevational range limits would very likely shift minimally. Given the fragmented nature of montane forests in the Eastern Arc Mountains and the limited ability of many understory bird species to cross forest gaps, a concerted effort to reconnect the largest and closest forest fragments with reforested linkages will be essential in the Eastern Arc Mountains [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] to reduce future elevational range contractions due to climate change and to permit species to shift their elevational ranges upslope in response to climate change.</p><p>The Eastern Arc Mountains, including the East and West Usambara Mountains, are globally important for threatened and endemic species, including birds [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. In the Usambara Mountains, nine bird species are currently listed as globally threatened: Long-billed Forest Warbler (<italic>Artisornis moreaui</italic>&#x02013;Critically Endangered (CR)); Sokoke Scops Owl (<italic>Otus ireneae</italic>&#x02013;Endangered (EN)); Usambara Akalat (<italic>Sheppardia montana</italic>&#x02013;EN); Usambara Hyliota (<italic>Hyliota usambara</italic>&#x02013;EN); Amani Sunbird (<italic>Hedydipna pallidigaster</italic>&#x02013;EN); Usambara Weaver (<italic>Ploceus nicolli</italic>&#x02013;EN); Banded Sunbird (<italic>Anthreptes rubritorques</italic>&#x02013;Vulnerable (VU)); Swynnerton&#x02019;s Robin (<italic>Swynnertonia swynnertoni</italic>&#x02013;VU); and Dapple-throat (<italic>Arcanator orostruthus</italic>&#x02013;VU). Of these, only one&#x02014;the Usambara Akalat&#x02014;was caught in sufficient numbers to be incorporated in the analysis. This species is endemic to the high elevations in the West Usambara Mountains. Forty years ago, it was abundant in the forests &#x0003e;1800 m in elevation, but our results suggest a decline on the order of 60%. As a mountain-top species, it cannot move any further upslope, and its conservation status is therefore of serious concern.</p><p>The remaining eight globally threatened species include four canopy species (Usambara Hyliota, Amani Sunbird, Banded Sunbird and Usambara Weaver) which were unlikely to be caught in mist-nets. However, five species (Long-billed Forest Warbler, Sokoke Scops Owl, Usambara Hyliota, Amani Sunbird, Swynnerton&#x02019;s Robin and Dapple-throat) were already very rare in the Usambara Mountains 40 years ago based on both mist-net and line transect surveys [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and are currently so based on mist-net surveys and opportunistic sightings (WDN; MHCNC personal observations). Consequently, climate change has very likely also impacted the elevational range of these species over the last four decades. There should be particular concern for the Long-billed Forest Warbler and the Usambara Hyliota, both of which are endemic to the East Usambara Mountains and have very narrow elevational ranges. The IUCN Red List status for all of these globally threatened species should be reassessed. We also recommend that conservation plans be developed for all of these species as soon as possible, and these should include a focus on emergency conservation measures, such as reconnecting forest fragments, and possibly even assisted colonization for species that face local or even global extinction without such measures [<xref rid="pone.0248712.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>].</p><p>Our results indicate that over the last four decades lower elevational range limits of understory bird species in the East and West Usambara Mountains have shifted upslope, upper elevational range limits have largely remained stationary, and consequently average elevational ranges of species have contracted. If this is the case for relatively mobile species such as birds, we can only assume that the situation is almost certainly worse for even more sedentary groups of animals and plants. Given the global importance of the East and West Usambara and other Eastern Arc Mountains for biodiversity conservation, a conservation strategy for species that addresses climate change is urgently needed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec010"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0248712.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Historic and current elevational range limits, and observed and corrected elevational range shifts for 29 focal understory bird species in the Usambara Mountains, Tanzania.</title><p>Number of captures are across both historic and current surveys.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0248712.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0248712.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Time-series Google Earth aerial imagery (1984&#x02013;2016) of study forest blocks and adjacent matrix habitats in the East and West Usambara Mountains, Tanzania.</title><p>The forest block displayed in row 1 contains survey sites at 360 m and 580 m; row 2 contains the survey site at 1020 m; row 3 contains the survey site at 1310 m; row 4 contains the survey site at 1530 m; and row 5 contains survey sites at 1820 m and 2110 m.

The MS do not have single table and has only two figures. The data can be more appropriately visualized graphically or through tables. Authors can atleast provide map of the study area showing current and historical sampling locations (hope they are not exactly the same). I understand that sampling elevations are same but I presume locations must be different. Hence, make this point clear in the methods section and include map as suggested.</p><p>2. Since there will be definite LULC change of the landscape between historical period (1979-81) and current (2019), I suggest the authors to prepare LULC map of both time scale and report any change that have undergone during this 40 years period. This will be helpful to understand whether some of the range shifts in birds is due to landuse change rather than climate change per se. Otherwise, how did authors control over land use changes (leading to habitat change) over these years?</p><p>Reviewers' comments:</p><p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p><p><bold>Comments to the Author</bold></p><p>1.

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#x000a0;This is a great paper. It clearly describes why the study is important, what the authors found, and what these results mean. I have only one minor comment.</p><p>1) Please clarify how elevational shifts were calculated for upper and lower range limits. In particular, it does matter whether all species are included in these calculations or whether species historically found at the lower limit were excluded for lower limit shifts and at upper limit excluded for upper limit shift. This is mentioned in the Discussion but should be incorporated into the more general results as well. Particularly for the upper limits, it makes sense to NOT include species that already live at the highest elevation when calculating upper elevation shifts.</p><p>Also please fix the references in text to consistently match the correct style</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;My only concern about this manuscript is with the interpretation that these species are moving upslope rather than just disappearing from lower elevations. The study landscape is a very complex one and the West Usambaras (all of the high-elevation sites) and the east Usambaras (all of the low-elevation sites) are separated by a large lowland savannah/agricultural gap and seem very unlikely to have much bird movement between them. Rather, they seem to have independently evolved communities in which all of the movements are likely to have been within them. I therefore wonder if the threat is not much greater than indicated with the east Usambara species simply being pushed upslope with nowhere to go. All of the other comparable paper have dealt with continuous transects in which dispersal is not limited. If you have evidence to the contrary, then I would need to see it to have enough confidence that these bids can in fact cross these gaps. If not, then the analysis needs to be done separately for the two mountain ranges.</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#x000a0;Summary:</p><p>This study performs a resurvey of bird communities (following on initial studies 40 years ago) along an elevational gradient made up of forest fragments in the East and West Usambara Mountains of Tanzania. The authors document shifts in mean, lower and upper limits for nearly 30 species, using a range of methods including Monte Carlo simulations to test for significant shifts and ordination analysis of community similarity metrics. The majority of species showed upslope shifts, though a handful shifted downslope in this landscape, and lower elevation limits shifted more than upper limits, resulting in range contractions in the community. The authors point to influences such as the limited ability of species to cross gaps, which could impact the observed range shifts in this Afromontane region.</p><p>I think this is a solid study that could make a nice contribution to PLoSONE, though with substantive revisions. The dataset is unique and important, the manuscript is well written and the text is balanced. Yet I feel that the manuscript is falling slightly short of the mark, or rather, not expressing its potential, in showing how this helps us understand climate change impacts on tropical species in fragmented landscapes. This can be improved by first giving more context (in the introduction) for how fragmentation can further disrupt the continuity of populations as they respond to shifting climates (possible predictions and well formulated questions). For example, will fragments experience local environmental changes the same way as large tracts of continuous forest? If not, how are they expected to differ? Rather, most of the introduction text focuses on stating that we don&#x02019;t know much about these systems, which is valid, but there is little development beyond that. Adding more meat here to explore what we do know, about responses to climate change along other montane gradients, and/or responses to fragmentation in other systems, could set up the study better.</p><p>Second, I think the authors can do more to dig into the results, e.g., to ask if there are particular characteristics of species that are associated with movements (upslope or downslope, or the extent of shifts). Can we draw generalities on how tropical communities/groups of species/guilds will be impacted? Are there any comparisons that can be made across studies to draw additional insights here? I appreciate that brevity is emphasized, but it seems there is room to address this in more depth in the introduction and discussion, and doing so could make this a stronger contribution.</p><p>Third, I am left unconvinced regarding the fragmentation component of the study and the role it plays either formally or conceptually in the manuscript. There is not much depth in assessing how fragmentation affects how species shift in their ranges, except to say that the study was performed in a fragmented landscape. The results are considered in the extent of species range shifts compared to those found in other studies, but this is all done without thinking about any specific or general impacts of fragmentation, qualitatively or quantitatively. Would there be a way, for example, to test whether species track expected climate shifts more closely if they are found within the same forest blocks (or conversely, more likely to lag behind expected shifts if they are in different forest blocks)? It seems there could be a way to assess whether species that additionally have to contend with jumping between fragments in order to shift ranges are lagging further behind those that do not (i.e., the species that can move upslope within the same forest block). (It&#x02019;s also possible that I don&#x02019;t fully understand the layout and connectedness of the forest patches in the landscape &#x02013; I&#x02019;m just making inferences here based on Table 1).</p><p>As an aside, I found the patterns of slower colonization at the upper range limits really interesting. I wonder if there are other behavioral drivers that mediate these movements? Consider conspecific attraction &#x02013; where individuals are more likely to settle in an area if conspecifics are already present (particularly if the presence of individuals serves as a measure of habitat quality). This could apply to your system, since individuals moving upslope from the lower limit are moving into areas where conspecifics are present, whereas those at the upper range limit are effectively colonizing areas where the species is all together absent or at most at very low densities. If conspecific attraction is important for colonization, this could create a lag in movements at upper limits versus lower ones. Is there any documentation of this elsewhere? It would be an interesting point to entertain briefly in the discussion, space permitting.</p><p>Line specific comments and recommendations are below:</p><p>Introduction</p><p>Lines 51: desvasting -&#x0003e; devastating</p><p>Lines 55-56: The authors point out here that we know little about how elevational range shifts may occur in the tropics when species are simultaneously responding to habitat discontinuities and fragmentation. This is an important theme that makes this study unique from others, but there is little other context for how this could compound responses to climate change. What potential impacts have been proposed? What will we learn by doing such studies in fragmented landscapes? I think the overall impact of the study will be higher if this is articulated more, here in the introduction, and connected with some of the ideas put forward in the discussion (or even better if fragmentation can be analyzed formally).</p><p>Lines 68-74: I encourage the authors to state some hypotheses clearly at the end of the introduction. What are you expecting to see with these surveys? Could you set up the comparison to expected changes due to warming, based on other studies? Having more context ahead of this, as recommended above, would better lead into the questions/aims of the study.</p><p>Line 59-60: Should these references also be numbered?</p><p>Methods:</p><p>Line 88: What is the &#x0201c;cold season&#x0201d; &#x02013; is this characterized by less rain? Is this associated with the breeding season for the bird community? Notably, the resurvey is sampling a narrower duration of months compared to the original survey -- are the authors confident that these sampling periods are nevertheless capturing the same season? (In other words, could slight differences in seasonality be an issue here?)</p><p>Lines 111-161: I think the analytical methods are well executed here. I like the approach of using Monte Carlo simulations to account for differences in capture numbers between the time periods (though I had to read through this several times to get it), as well as the PCoA on the Bray-Curtis matrix.</p><p>Results:</p><p>Is there a way of explicitly considering the compositional change or range shifts within and between forest blocks? This seems important to fully base the study on the effects of fragmented forest on movement rates (otherwise the incorporation of fragmentation is a bit superficial, if there is no formal characterization in the study design or data analysis).</p><p>Lines 166-167: Which species were not represented in the resurvey? &#x0003e;13% decline in species richness is substantial. Could additional summaries be given for those species missing from the current survey?</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>In the discussion, I would like to see more in-depth evaluation of the kinds of species that move downslope, or those that are more likely to move upslope. Given the possibility for comparisons across three studies (Forero-Medina et al., Freeman &#x00026; Class, and your study) it seems there is ample opportunity to dig into these patterns a bit more (even while maintaining brevity in the manuscript). I&#x02019;ll reiterate here that this study makes an important contribution to our understanding of upper and lower range limit shifts in tropical systems, particularly by adding a new dataset from the Afrotropics. But the manuscript now stands more as a report on these patterns, yet it could do more to explore the context of patterns, first by setting up clearer questions and possible predictions at the beginning, and then layering some comparisons across studies that considers which species/groups have predictable responses (or not) in your study and across others like this one.</p><p>Lines 260-270: Here you report the greater frequency of movements within forest blocks than between forest blocks &#x02013; so this points to dispersal limitation of species and/or sensitivity to cross gaps. Are these formally reported in the results section? (These kinds of results can put more emphasis on the interactions between fragmentation and climate change in affecting range shifts).</p><p>Lines 295-298: &#x0201c;Our results suggest that climate warming in combination with average distance among fragments and the limited dispersal ability of many species are very likely important contributory factors to the observed range contractions in bird species in the Usambara Mountains.&#x0201d;</p><p>Here I don&#x02019;t really think the authors have completely made this case, especially as the results relate to the average distance among fragments. Distance among fragments was not considered explicitly in the analysis itself (I think it should be).</p><p>Lines 320 &#x02013; 332: I like the emphasis on the high elevation endemics in drawing attention to the conservation priority for this region, though the discussion is necessarily limited since for most of the endemics there are few data available to do a robust analysis. Can the authors address (through personal observation) whether these endemic species are rare numerically, or just not easily detected using the methods employed in this study?</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

One very important point:</p><p>I like the addition of explicit consideration of elevational range changes in fragmented landscapes. However, and this is a big however, it does mean that the whole pitch of the paper has changed based on the results.</p><p>This is an example of hypothesizing after the results are known. The hypothesis here is that fragmentation differentially affects range shifts at lower vs. upper elevation limits via reduced rates of colonization. As is, a reader assumes that the study was designed to test this hypothesis. This is not the case.</p><p>To fix this, the authors should be open about the relationship between their data and hypotheses about fragmentation. The authors should clearly state (1) what their results were and (2) introduce the hypothesis as a possible explanation of their results [Rather than (1) introduce the hypothesis and (2) describe a test of these predictions]. For example, the authors can say they observed a difference in changes at low vs. high elevation limits towards the end of the Introduction, then subsequently introduce the idea that difficulty of upslope colonizations in fragmented landscapes is a possible explanation for this interesting observation. All text, and the conceptual figure, should stay. Just be clear that these are post-hoc hypotheses. This is perfectly valid, does nothing to detract from the paper, and correctly represents this project [as far as I can judge, based on the original manuscript].</p><p>A couple important points:</p><p>clarify in Abstract that landscape was already fragmented in the 1970s.</p><p>Suggestion: Add a figure showing changes in elevations for each species (e.g. each species a column, elevation on the y axis). And/or a strip chart / box plot showing change in total elevational size to illustrate that most species are contracting in range.</p><p>And the following thoughts:</p><p>text in Figure 1 low-resolution / hard to read. True for other figures too - make sure final version are high-res.</p><p>beyond the scope of this paper, but interesting to think about specific predictions for range shifts at species&#x02019; lower limits in fragmented landscapes. Figure 1 illustrates the situation if temperature is the driver (species disappears from lowest fragment and is not present at lowest elevation of second-lowest fragment). One possibility is that upslope shifts at species&#x02019; lower limits result from being &#x0201c;pushed&#x0201d; up by biotic interactions linked to temperature. In this case, and if dispersal is generally very low (not just for the birds, but also for species whom they interact with in ways important for range limits), then you might expect the species to disappear from the lowest fragment (where it is pushed up) but still live at the lowest elevation of the second-lowest fragment (where there is nothing arriving to &#x0201c;push&#x0201d; it upslope).</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;The authors have done what they can to address the problem of the separation of the East and West Usambaras by lower-elevation savannah. I know the distances among fragments are the same, but I still worry that few, if any of these species would cross lowland savannah between the two ranges. Nevertheless, the new analyses address this issue to some extent and the conclusions recognize how extremely limited these species are in their ability to move upslope, a problem exacerbated by the separation of the two mountain ranges. Therefore, I am now confident that the conclusions drawn from the data are fully supported.</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#x000a0;I commend the authors in putting together such an interesting and well executed study. The authors were attentive to my suggestions and addressed the requested edits thoroughly. I like the addition of the conceptual model and predictions, the added consideration of effects across species with different natural history characteristics, and the broader comparisons to other tropical studies globally.</p><p>**********</p><p>7.
