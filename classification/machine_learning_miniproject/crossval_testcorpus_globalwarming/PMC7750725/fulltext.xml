We investigated changes in life cycle timing in a global warming scenario. We compared <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> ecotypes adapted to the warm/dry Cape Verdi Islands (Cvi), Macaronesia, and the cool/wet climate of the Burren (Bur), Ireland, Northern Europe. These are obligate winter and summer annuals, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s0101"><title>Methods</title><p>Using a global warming scenario predicting a 4 &#x000b0;C temperature rise from 2011 to approx. 2080, we produced F<sub>1</sub> seeds at each end of a thermogradient tunnel. Each F<sub>1</sub> cohort (cool and warm) then produced F<sub>2</sub> seeds at both ends of the thermal gradient in winter and summer annual life cycles. F<sub>2</sub> seeds from the winter life cycle were buried at three positions along the gradient to determine the impact of temperature on seedling emergence in a simulated winter life cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s0102"><title>Key Results</title><p>In a winter life cycle, increasing temperatures advanced flowering time by 10.1 d &#x000b0;C<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> in the winter annual and 4.9 d &#x000b0;C<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> in the summer annual. Plant size and seed yield responded positively to global warming in both ecotypes. In a winter life cycle, the impact of increasing temperature on seedling emergence timing was positive in the winter annual, but negative in the summer annual. Global warming reduced summer annual plant size and seed yield in a summer life cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s0103"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Seedling emergence timing observed in the north European summer annual ecotype may exacerbate the negative impact of predicted increased spring and summer temperatures on their establishment and reproductive performance. In contrast, seedling establishment of the Macaronesian winter annual may benefit from higher soil temperatures that will delay emergence until autumn, but which also facilitates earlier spring flowering and consequent avoidance of high summer temperatures. Such plasticity gives winter annual arabidopsis ecotypes a distinct advantage over summer annuals in expected global warming scenarios. This highlights the importance of variation in the timing of seedling establishment in understanding plant species responses to anthropogenic climate change.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd> Arabidopsis</kwd><kwd>climate change</kwd><kwd>dormancy</kwd><kwd>flowering time</kwd><kwd>global warming</kwd><kwd>seedling emergence</kwd><kwd>summer annual</kwd><kwd>temperature adaptation</kwd><kwd>winter annual</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council-UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/I022201/1</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Plants synchronize their life cycles with changes in the seasonal environment (phenology) (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Donohue, 2014</xref>). The major phase changes in plant life cycles are flowering and germination, which mark the transitions to the reproductive and the vegetative phases, respectively. These phenological events are linked and both are known to be temperature driven (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Springthorpe and Penfield, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Burghardt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Finch-Savage and Footitt, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Penfield and MacGregor, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Meta-analysis of 20&#x02013;50 years of multispecies flowering time data found it to have advanced by 1 d per decade in species responding to warming spring temperatures (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Cook <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). This makes understanding the impact of global warming on plant phenology crucially important as we address the resilience of both agricultural systems and native flora. A number of studies have highlighted the advancement of plant growth and flowering as spring becomes warmer (as reviewed in <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Parmesan and Hanley, 2015</xref>). Other studies have shown the impact of reduced winter chilling on major temperate fruit crop species such as <italic>Malus</italic>, <italic>Pyrus</italic> and <italic>Prunus</italic>, with higher winter and spring temperatures resulting in increased flower bud abscission, and poor flower quality, fruit set and yield (as reviewed in <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Atkinson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p><p>A model showing the impact of temperature on flowering time, seed set and dormancy in the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (L.) Heynh. ecotype Columbia (Col-0), which exhibits both winter and summer annual behaviour, was developed by <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Springthorpe and Penfield (2015)</xref>. Increasing temperature accelerated flowering time to set seed development in an ambient temperature window coincident with a temperature-sensitive switch in dormancy. This resulted in seed shedding at a temperature range of 14&#x02013;15 &#x000b0;C. Seeds produced below this range were more dormant and those above less dormant. This is a bet hedging strategy to produce seeds at a range of dormancy levels that will respond to conditions for optimum seedling emergence in the field (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Springthorpe and Penfield, 2015</xref>). When seeds of obligate winter and summer annual <italic>A. thaliana</italic> ecotypes were matured along a thermal gradient in a global warming scenario, the critical temperature for switching from deep to shallow dormancy was in the range 14&#x02013;16 &#x000b0;C (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>).</p><p>These two studies show that parental plasticity provides an indication of how plants adjust their phenology along a climate/temperature gradient but do not address their potential response over more than one generation to global warming. <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Auge <italic>et al.</italic> (2017)</xref> reasoned that although parental plasticity is a useful predictor of progeny behaviour in stable seasonal environments, this relationship might break down if conditions change in the next generation. At this point, the plasticity of the progeny to environmental signals is a better predictor of life cycle outcomes. The plasticity of the parent as evidenced by its ability to respond to within-generation environmental change has a direct bearing on the ability to adapt to trans-generational changes (for a review, see <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Auge <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>).</p><p>In a changing climate, populations with the greatest genetic variability will more readily adapt. This may take the form of the advancement in flowering time (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Cook <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Springthorpe and Penfield, 2015</xref>), or through the spatial and temporal dispersal of seeds (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">De Casas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Both aspects of seed dispersal influence the environments experienced by progeny. Spatial dispersal enables exploitation of more favourable environments by physically relocating seeds, while temporal dispersal in the form of seed dormancy cycling synchronizes the seedling emergence with environments favourable for successful seedling establishment. These strategies are reviewed by <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">De Casas <italic>et al.</italic> (2015)</xref> and Finch-Savage and <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Footitt (2017)</xref>.</p><p>Dormancy/germination is under strong environmental and genetic control. Secondary dormancy induction that occurs post-seed dispersal is by either low or high temperature depending on the climate to which populations are adapted (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Footitt <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Montesinos-Navarro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). These responses to temperature are likely to alter life cycle timing as the climate warms, for example flowering time (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Cook <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), and in the life cycles of a wide range of animal species (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Bradshaw and Holzapfel, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Work on <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> (M. Bieb.), whose seeds have simple dormancy requiring only exposure to low temperature for dormancy removal and seedling emergence, showed that global warming would result in reduced seedling emergence. However, as seeds emerging at higher temperatures have reduced dormancy and therefore a reduced requirement for low temperature, selection for lower dormancy would result in subsequent generations maintaining competitiveness (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Footitt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). To understand temperature-driven changes in the relationship between flowering time and dormancy <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Marcer <italic>et al.</italic> (2018)</xref> surveyed 300 Iberian populations of <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. This revealed that as minimum temperature increases, early flowering and deeper seed dormancy were favoured, indicating that this life cycle phenotype would become more common.</p><p>Here, we address the impact of global warming under &#x02018;natural&#x02019; seasonal conditions on the phenological plasticity of the two major phase transitions in the plant life cycle: flowering time and seedling emergence (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Donohue, 2014</xref>). To do this, we adopted a unique approach involving reciprocal transplantation along a thermal gradient in a common garden. We established a thermal gradient of +4 &#x000b0;C in a thermogradient tunnel to produce a realistic global warming scenario for the experimental area between 2011&#x02013;2013 and 2080 (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Wurr <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). Using a combined global warming&#x02013;common garden approach, we previously showed the potential for changes in seed maturation temperature to alter seed dormancy and germination behaviour in crop and weed members of the Brassicaceae (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Footitt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Awan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Due to its wide geographical range and large number of ecotypes, Arabidopsis is an ideal indicator species for investigating the impact of global warming on plant phenology. This is relevant in the wider context of plant biology. Here, in a global warming scenario, we test the phenological plasticity of the respective obligate winter and summer annual arabidopsis ecotypes Cvi from the Cape Verdi islands in Macaronesia and Bur from the Burren in Ireland, Northern Europe that have adapted to hot/dry and cool/wet climates separated by 17 &#x000b0;C of latitude (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Footitt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Using seeds produced at opposite ends of a thermal gradient, we raised plants under reciprocal temperature conditions under winter and summer life cycles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials" id="s2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s3"><title>Simulating a global warming scenario in a thermogradient tunnel</title><p>Experiments used <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> in a field-based thermogradient tunnel (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Wurr <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>) to investigate the impact of temperature over two generations in a global warming scenario. Operation of this polyethylene tunnel (32 m long &#x000d7; 9 m wide) is described elsewhere (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Wurr <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Footitt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). The tunnel enabled plant growth under natural daylengths and with a high percentage (76 %) of natural levels of irradiance. The basic operation involves monitoring the temperature outside the tunnel, reacting to which an electronic climate control system operates fans generating opposing warmed and ambient air flows to maintain an air temperature gradient from ambient at one end of the tunnel to approximately ambient +4 &#x000b0;C at the other end (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Wurr <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). This represents a projected median emissions scenario for the local experimental area used in this work (West Midlands, UK) that indicates an increase in the summer mean temperature of 3.7 &#x000b0;C by 2080 (UK Climate Change Projections, 2014; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ukclimateprojections.metoffice.gov.uk/">http://ukclimateprojections.metoffice.gov.uk/</ext-link>). Continuous monitoring of air and soil temperatures along the tunnel enabled varying degrees of simulated climate warming depending on position along the tunnel. This established realistic seasonal and diurnal air and soil temperature fluctuations in the tunnel.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p>The experiments compared two arabidopsis ecotypes, Cape Verde Islands (Cvi; N8580) and Burren (Bur; N6643) that exhibit obligate winter and summer annual behaviour, respectively, at the experimental site used (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Footitt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). In February 2011, non-dormant seeds of each ecotype were sown into compost (Levington F2/sand/vermiculite at a ratio of 6:1:1) in P24 cellular trays (24 cells, each 5 &#x000d7; 5 &#x000d7; 5 cm) held in capillary matting-lined seed trays. Seedlings were grown in a temperature-controlled glasshouse (23/17 &#x000b0;C, 16/8 h, light/dark) to bolting and then transferred to the thermal gradient as described in <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, (2018)</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Plants were placed at the cool/ambient end and the warm end of the tunnel (denoted as positions C and W) representing current temperature and the presumptive temperature for 2080. Harvesting of mature F<sub>1</sub> seeds was from the 21 to 26 April 2011 by hand threshing, followed by equilibration at 15 % relative humidity/15 &#x000b0;C for 7 d to produce an equilibrium moisture content of 5&#x02013;7 % on a dry weight basis. Seeds were stored at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C in sealed tubes. This strategy enabled completion of the reproductive phase (bolting to mature seed) under the conditions of a winter annual life cycle.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Seed thermal history. F<sub>0</sub> seedlings were grown under glasshouse conditions then at bolting transferred to the thermogradient tunnel. F<sub>0</sub> plants then produced F<sub>1</sub> seeds at the cool (C) and warm (W) ends of the thermal gradient. F<sub>1</sub> seedlings were grown under winter and summer annual life cycles at both ends of the thermal gradient, producing F<sub>2</sub> seeds with contrasting thermal histories.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mcaa141f0001"/></fig><p>In 2012, F<sub>1</sub> seeds produced above at the C and W end of the thermal gradient were surface sterilized in a 0.125 % sodium hypochlorite solution (household bleach: 5 % sodium hypochlorite, diluted to 2.5 % v/v) for 5 min and then washed three times with distilled water. Seeds (&#x02265;200 from each cohort) were then plated onto a sterile nylon mesh (mesh size 125 &#x003bc;m; Clarcor UK, UK) held in Petri plates containing 0.7 % agarose and half-strength Murashige and Skoog (1/2 MS) salts at pH 5.8. Dormancy was broken by nicking the seed coats with a syringe needle. After sealing with micropore tape, then sealing in freezer bags and wrapping in aluminium foil, the plates were incubated at 5 &#x000b0;C/dark for 3 d then transferred to constant light at 15 &#x000b0;C. Following germination, seedlings were transplanted at the first true leaf stage to compost in trays as above in the thermogradient tunnel. This gave 24 seedling from each C and W cohort at each end of the thermal gradient.</p><p>Seedlings of both ecotypes grown in the thermogradient tunnel experienced winter and summer annual life cycles (hereafter denoted as WLC and SLC, respectively), as described below, under ambient temperature at the cool end and those predicted for 2080 at the warm end of the tunnel. Seedlings (<italic>n</italic> = 24) from F<sub>1</sub> seeds produced at the cool end were grown to maturity at both positions C and W (denoted respectively as C@C and C@W) with one tray (<italic>n</italic> = 24) at each position. Similarly, at the same time, seedlings of F<sub>1</sub> seeds produced at the warm end were grown to maturity at both positions. This gives the intergeneration temperature combinations of C@C, W@C, C@W and W@W (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). In the WLC, seedling were transplanted to the tunnel on 19 November 2012, and in the SLC on 17 May 2013. At bolting, each plant was isolated using an Aracon (Arasystem, Belgium) to prevent cross-pollination and to facilitate seed collection. When two-thirds of the siliques on the plants in a tray had turned yellow, watering stopped to allow plants to dry for 7 d. At harvest, each plant was dried in a paper bag for 7 d at 15 &#x000b0;C/15 % relative humidity. After threshing and cleaning, F<sub>2</sub> seeds were sealed in tubes, and stored at &#x02013;80 &#x000b0;C. A number of parameters were recorded as components of fitness for each plant during the life cycle and post-harvest. These included the phenological measures days from transplanting to bolting (inflorescence extended to 1 cm) and number of rosette leaves at bolting, and plant height at harvest as a measure of size. Further direct measures of fitness were plant dry weight including flower and silique tissue following seed collection, and seed yield. Plant dry weight was determined after drying at 80 &#x000b0;C for 48 h.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Germination analysis of F<sub>2</sub> seeds</title><p>Seeds were surface sterilized as above then plated in three replicates of 40 seeds into 12 &#x000d7; 8 cm boxes (Stewart Plastics Ltd, UK) containing two pieces of 3MM chromatography paper and 8 mL of liquid.

Burial of seeds of both ecotypes produced under all temperature regimes during the WLC was in pots to represent shedding to soil in late spring consistent with this annual life cycle in order to investigate seed behaviour in the seed bank. Actual burial dates were, Bur on 10 June 2013 (C@W and W@W) and 21 June 2013 (C@C and W@C) and for Cvi on 23 May 2013 (C@W and W@W) and 21 June 2013 (C@C and W@C). The delayed dates resulted from delayed flowering and seed maturation at the cool end of the thermal gradient. Soil was disturbed in each pot every 2 weeks to expose seeds to light. Seedling emergence was recorded and seedlings removed weekly, more often during peak emergence periods, until October 2014.</p><p>Burial was at three positions in the thermogradient tunnel designated as cool, medium and warm. The cool and warm positions were those used for plant growth, with the medium position equidistant between the two. The soil temperature gradient between the cool and warm ends of the tunnel was 2.5 &#x000b0;C. Three biologically independent replicates of 500 seed were used.

Two-way ANOVA was used to test for interaction of temperature regimes on biomass. In one-way ANOVA, Bonferroni correction was used and multiple comparisons for significance used Tukey&#x02019;s range test. Flowering time, temperature from transplanting to bolting, temperature over 30 d prior to harvest, rosette leaf number at bolting, and plant height, dry weight and seed yield at harvest were analysed by one-way ANOVA separately for each life cycle and ecotype to determine the impact of the intergenerational temperature regimes (e.g. C@C). Final germination and seedling emergence is shown as the mean with the 95 % confidence interval. In the seedling emergence trial, seeds were buried at different times (see above) due to the impact of the thermal gradient on flowering time and seed development. To account for this, analysis of seedling emergence took the final burial date for each ecotype as the starting point for the analysis. Analysis was performed by converting total emergence to December 2013 to 100 % and calculating time to 50 % emergence of the total emerged seedlings by performing Probit transformation of the data and linear regression analysis of each replicate. Two-way ANOVA was performed to detect interaction between the global warming scenario (soil temperature) and the intergenerational temperature regimes separately on each ecotype. This was followed by one-way ANOVA to detect separately significant effects of the global warming scenario (soil temperature) and the intergenerational temperature regimes on each ecotype. Statistical analysis used Excel and the Real Statistics Resource Pack software (Release 6.8) (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Zaiontz 2020</xref>).

F<sub>1</sub> seeds were produced under a global warming scenario representing the ambient thermal environment (2011) and that predicted for approx. 2080 (ambient +3.7 &#x000b0;C) (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). Each F<sub>1</sub> cohort then experienced WLC and SLC to produce the F<sub>2</sub> generation in our global warming scenario. In response to global warming, phenological plasticity was examined and this revealed intergenerational effects of temperature on both major phase transitions in the plants life cycle, i.e. flowering and seedling emergence.</p><sec id="s20"><title>Flowering time</title><p>In the WLC, Cvi flowered 6&#x02013;8 weeks earlier than Bur at both ends of the thermal gradient. In the SLC, this difference was only 3 d at the warm end, with no difference at the cool end. This difference in flowering time in the WLC results from the vernalization-independent late flowering phenotype of Bur driven by late flowering loci other than <italic>FLOWERING LOCUS C</italic> (<italic>FLC</italic>), because in Bur <italic>FLC</italic> is a null allele (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Werner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). This mutation may drive the summer annual behaviour of Bur observed by <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Ratcliffe (1976)</xref> in its native habitat.</p><p>Significant differences in the time to bolting in both ecotypes in the WLC and SLC revealed differences in phenological plasticity of flowering time in response to global warming. In Bur, flowering time advanced by 4.92 and 0.49 d &#x000b0;C<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> in the respective WLC and SLC, while in Cvi it advanced by 10.1 and 1.0 d &#x000b0;C<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>. This greater plasticity of the obligate winter annual ecotype Cvi shows that it is more adaptable to future global warming than the summer annual Bur which may reflect their adaptation to warm/dry (Cvi) and cool/wet (Bur) climates (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Footitt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; Finch-Savage and <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Footitt, 2017</xref>). Differences in intergenerational temperature had no impact on flowering time in Bur. However, in Cvi, warm conditions during F<sub>1</sub> seed development significantly advanced flowering time during F<sub>2</sub> seed production at the cool end of the thermal gradient in both the WLC and SLC, indicating the operation of a thermal memory. The advance of flowering time in Cvi in the WLC (W@C) resulted in significantly greater biomass and a larger but non-significantly greater seed yield. In Bur, seed yield was less under warm summer conditions, as seen previously (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). This indicates increased fitness and bet hedging potential in Cvi compared with Bur. In the Col-0 ecotype, ancestral heat stress also increased fitness and accelerated flowering (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Whittle <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Migicovsky <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). The mechanism underlying this thermo-memory that promotes reproduction and fitness by accelerating flowering was identified by <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic> (2019)</xref>. This mechanism may contribute to other intergenerational temperature effects seen here, such as greater seed yield (Bur) and changes in biomass (Cvi).</p><p>The relationship between biomass and seed yield also differs between the two ecotypes. In Bur, these measures of fitness are positively correlated, but not in Cvi. The <italic>FLC</italic> null allele of Bur delays flowering time in the WLC, allowing more rosette leaves to be produced. Even in the SLC when flowering is at the same time as Cvi, Bur has more rosette leaves, with 2&#x000d7; to 4&#x000d7; more rosette leaves than Cvi in the two life cycles. In contrast, Cvi rosette leaf number appears to be fixed. Therefore, Bur has a larger vegetative source tissue contributing to the reproductive sink. Furthermore, the later flowering of Bur in the WLC would result in higher light intensity to provide increased potential for photosynthesis. The restriction in vegetative source tissue may explain the more stunted growth habit of Cvi seen here.</p><p>The impact of rising CO<sub>2</sub> during future climate change is not accounted for here. However, higher CO<sub>2</sub> levels resulted in earlier flowering and increased seed yield in arabidopsis (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Ward and Strain 1997</xref>). It is unclear if this will counter the impact of temperature on seed yield , particularly in Bur where increased temperature has a negative effect on fertility (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Huang <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). In the wider context, flowering time determines the thermal window for seed development and maturation (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Springthorpe and Penfield, 2015</xref>), with flowering time genes also contributing to seed dormancy. Of these, <italic>FLC</italic> in the zygotic environment reduces dormancy, but it is repressed by the autonomous flowering pathway (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Chiang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Auge <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). However, in Bur, <italic>FLC</italic> is a null allele (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Werner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) so plays no part in dormancy.</p></sec><sec id="s21"><title>Seedling emergence timing (SET)</title><p>Manipulation of the thermal environment during F<sub>1</sub> seed production altered future life cycles. First, it altered the timing of the F<sub>1</sub> reproductive phase transition (bolting time). This is consistent with later, rather than earlier, environments in the parental life cycle being better predictors of progeny environments (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Auge <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Secondly, we found that SET in the F<sub>2</sub> generation responds to the environment experienced during F<sub>1</sub> seed production.</p><p>In both ecotypes, warm temperatures experienced in the F<sub>2</sub> generation decreased primary dormancy when germination was tested in the laboratory, consistent with earlier reports (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Kendall <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Awan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). Laboratory-based dormancy tests are blunt instruments not always suited to differentiating long-term impacts of the environment. Therefore, to further investigate the effect of intergenerational temperature, we looked at SET along the thermal gradient. When seeds were buried in spring to mimic seed dispersal following a WLC, we observed a strong influence of the intergenerational thermal memory on dormancy cycling leading to SET. If SET responded only to the seasonal soil temperatures experienced, the peak SET would have been the same regardless of the temperature experienced in the maternal environment. We show that this is not the case as maternal temperatures influenced subsequent SET.</p><p>The response of SET to soil temperature differed between Bur and Cvi. Bur seedling emergence occurred when soil temperature was rising and falling, indicating greater plasticity in this trait than in Cvi, which only emerged when soil temperature was falling, as seen previously (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Footitt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>). Soil temperature also had a significant impact on total seedling emergence along the thermal gradient. Total emergence in Bur decreased and in Cvi increased at higher temperatures. In both ecotypes, the soil temperature gradient (2.5 &#x000b0;C) between the cool and warm ends of the tunnel had a significant impact on peak SET, which was delayed at the warm end. In both ecotypes, the earliest peak in SET was at the cool end of the gradient. Increasing soil temperature delayed emergence in seeds from each growth temperature regime. This is consistent with induction (Bur), and relief (Cvi) of secondary dormancy by higher temperatures (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Footitt <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s22"><title>SET in Bur</title><p>In Bur, the early peak SET at the cool end of the thermal gradient reflects greater dormancy loss under cooler conditions. As dormancy is reduced, seeds enter a shallow dormancy phase. In this state, they become receptive to environmental signals that remove the final layer of dormancy (e.g. light), and the permissive temperature range for germination increases (Finch-Savage and <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Footitt, 2017</xref>). Total seedling emergence was greater in the middle of the thermal gradient. The delay in peak SET at the warm end of the gradient results from secondary dormancy induction by the elevated temperature reducing the proportion of the population receptive to dormancy-breaking signals. Here, in the absence of environmental signals that remove the final layer of dormancy, secondary dormancy induction by high temperature counteracts the ability of this ecotype to germinate. The ability of Bur to germinate at the warmer temperatures may have evolved due to lack of high temperature selection pressure in the low temperature environment to which this ecotype is adapted. As seedlings emerge along the thermal gradient, the order in which seeds from the different temperature regimes reach peak SET changes until at the warm end the order of peak SET is the same as seen for Cvi at all positions along the gradient. It therefore appears that increasing soil temperature forces Bur to act more like the obligate winter annual Cvi.</p></sec><sec id="s23"><title>SET in Cvi</title><p>In the deeply dormant Cvi ecotype, emergence was lower than in Bur. However, a clear effect of the maternal temperature regimes emerged. At each position along the thermal gradient, the earliest and latest peak SET was in seeds with C@W and W@C thermal histories, respectively, indicating that warm temperatures in the F<sub>2</sub> generation reduced dormancy, and advanced emergence and cool temperatures had the opposite effect. Seeds with W@W and C@C thermal histories had intermediate SET peaks. This indicates the impact of thermal history on seed behaviour in the field.</p><p>Overall, as temperature increased along the gradient, Cvi seeds experience temperatures that remove dormancy as seen in the field and laboratory (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Footitt <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). However, at these temperatures, sensitivity to spatial signals that remove the final layer of dormancy is not high enough for them to be effective; a consequence of the high temperature thermo-dormancy seen in Cvi. Only when soil temperature declines does an increasing proportion of the population become sensitive to spatial signals and seedling emergence commences. The seedling emergence phase ends as secondary dormancy is induced by decreasing soil temperature, as seen previously (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Footitt <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p><p>The regulation of SET appears to be by proteins encoded by the genes <italic>DELAY OF GERMINATION 1</italic> (<italic>DOG1</italic>) and <italic>ABA-HYPERSENSITIVE GERMINATION 1</italic> (<italic>AHG1</italic>).

In Cvi, flowering time advanced at twice the rate of that of Bur in a WLC. Cvi showed significant intergenerational responses in flowering time when the F<sub>1</sub> seed production was under the warmer conditions indicative of 2080. This is consistent with the operation of a thermal memory. Seedling emergence timing responded positively to increased temperature in Cvi, but negatively in Bur. This indicates that Cvi emergence would continue to occur past the peak in summer temperature so avoiding potential drought conditions. In contrast, in Bur, emergence would continue in potentially hostile environments for seedling establishment. Overall, we show that the obligate winter annual Cvi responds more positively to global warming than the obligate summer annual Bur. This confirms the prediction by <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Marcer <italic>et al.</italic>, (2018)</xref> that early flowering and deep dormancy will be selected for by a warming climate.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s25"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary data are available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://academic.oup.com/aob">https://academic.oup.com/aob</ext-link> and consist of the following.
