Here we performed thermal adaptation of two species and three strains of mesophilic microbes for improvement of the survival upper limit of temperature, and the improvement was evaluated by a newly developed method. To understand the limitation and variation of thermal adaptation, experiments with mutators and by multiple cultures were performed. The results of experiments including genome sequencing and analysis of the characteristics of mutants suggest that these microbes bear a genomic potential to endure a 2&#x02013;3&#x000b0;C rise in temperature but possess a limited variation of strategies for thermal adaptation.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by Advanced Low Carbon Technology Research and Development Program, which was granted by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JPMJAL1106) (T.K. and M.Y.) and MEXT-supported Program for Strategic Research Foundation at Private Universities, 2013-2017 (S1311017), and partially supported by the Core to Core Program A.

The fifth Assessment Report points out the possibility of various effects on society and the environment if the temperature continues to rise as it has been. Global warming may affect not only environments but also the diversity and populations of organisms. Each microorganism possesses a critical high temperature (CHT) that is an upper limit of survival as well as an optimum temperature for growth, probably due to the integration of various factors including general and unique metabolisms. Mesophilic microbes that have CHTs near the range of global warming would be crucially damaged by such a temperature rise. Their growth may be prevented or they may die, resulting in alterations in local ecosystems in which they are included. Alternatively, they might survive by adaptation to a temperature rise if effective mutations are accumulated. However, there has been no report on their capacity for adaptation to a rise in temperature and the variation in their strategies for adaptation, though there are many reports on <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> regarding improvement of thermal stability and regarding the perspective of evolution to adapt to fixed or stepwise increasing temperatures [<xref rid="pone.0215614.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0215614.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In order to obtain clues for understanding the survival of microbes under the condition of progressive global warming and for preventing the extinction of species, we carried out <italic>in vitro</italic> thermal adaptation experiments using three strains of microbes with different CHTs: two strains of <italic>Zymomonas mobilis</italic> and one strain of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. The upper limit of thermal adaptation was further examined by using mutators that are defective in mismatch repair and thus have a high mutation frequency [<xref rid="pone.0215614.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The strategic variation for thermal adaptation was investigated by repetitive cultivations of 4 lines of the same strain that were performed in parallel. The thermal adaptation of isolated mutants was evaluated by determination of their CHTs, by physiological characterization and by genomic sequencing analysis. The results suggested the genomic capacity of these microbes for survival in global warming. Here we also discuss functional overlapping of thermal adaptive mutations with thermotolerant genes, which are essential for survival around the CHT, in mesophilic microbes including <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>mobilis</italic> and <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0215614.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0215614.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p>The microbes used in this study were <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>mobilis</italic> strains CP4, LMG 457, TISTR 548 (ATCC29191), TISTR 405, TISTR 550, TISTR 551 and NCIMB 11163, mutants of TISTR 548 and CP4, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> K-12 strain W3110 (IN (<italic>rrnD-rrnE</italic>), <italic>rph-1</italic>) and mutants of W3110.

The temperature was up-shifted when the lag time was significantly reduced. Finally, no growth was observed after 200 cultivations when the temperature was increased to 40.5&#x000b0;C and the repeated cultivation was therefore stopped. After single colony isolation, mutants named 80M, 130M and 200M, which were obtained from 80, 130 and 200 repetitive cultivations, respectively, were isolated. 200M was isolated after about 1,150 generations from TISTR 548.

Colony-forming ability and live and dead cell analyses revealed that most of the cells in the first culture above their CHT died (Figs B and C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215614.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Notably, cells grown at 37&#x000b0;C, a temperature close to their CHT, were stained red as well as green, presumably due to some membrane damage at that temperature that allowed a red fluorescent dye to enter the cytoplasm, but the cells showed colony-forming units (CFU) about 3 orders of magnitude larger than those grown at 38&#x000b0;C. Similarly, the CHT of LMG 457 was determined to be 37&#x000b0;C and the CHTs of TISTR 548, TISTR 405, TISTR 550, TISTR 551 and NCIMB 11163 were all 38&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Thermal adaptation of <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>mobilis</italic> TISTR 548 and mutant characteristics</title><p>One of issues in this study was whether microbes have a limitation to their adaptation to a high temperature or whether mesophiles are able to evolve to become thermo-resistant at the thermophile level by accumulation of mutations. We thus attempted to clarify the potential of microbes for thermal adaptation. <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>mobilis</italic> TISTR 548 was exposed to repetitive cultivation with a gradual increase in temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215614.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), and thermoadapted mutants, called 80M, 130M and 200M, were obtained. Two-step cultivation analysis revealed that the CHTs of all three mutants were 40&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="pone.0215614.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215614.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>), though 130M and 200M exhibited faster growth and higher turbidity at 40&#x000b0;C than those of 80M. Since 130M and 200M exhibited almost the same levels of turbidity in the second cultivation, it is likely that thermal adaptation by repetitive cultivation had reached the limit. In addition to enhanced thermotolerance, 130M and 200M became resistant to a high concentration of glucose but sensitive to a low pH compared to the resistance and sensitivity of the parental strain (Fig A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215614.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). The cell morphology of <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>mobilis</italic> was changed at a temperature close to the CHT and the cells became filamentous. The cell lengths of the thermoadapted mutants 80M, 130M and 200M, however, were significantly smaller than the cell length of the parental strain at 37&#x000b0;C and 39&#x000b0;C, whereas the cell lengths of all strains were almost the same at 30&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215614.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that cell elongation at a high temperature is suppressed by thermal adaptation. Cells are exposed to oxidative stress at a temperature close to their CHT [<xref rid="pone.0215614.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0215614.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Consistently, TISTR 548 showed remarkable accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at 39&#x000b0;C, but all of the thermoadapted mutants showed a low level of ROS accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215614.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). We measured respiratory activity because it has been reported that reduction of NADH dehydrogenase activity in the respiratory chain is somehow linked to enhancement of thermotolerance [<xref rid="pone.0215614.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. All of the thermoadapted mutants exhibited only about half of the NADH dehydrogenase and oxidase activities of the parental strain (Fig B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215614.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that one of the reasons for the thermal adaptation in these mutants is a low level of NADH dehydrogenase activity, which may reduce leakage of electrons and thus prevent the accumulation of ROS.

There is no Tn insertion mutation in thermoadapted mutants from <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>mobilis</italic> CP4 and <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> W3110, though SNSs and indel(s) are present in those from all three strains.

At least in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, mutation frequency might thus be higher around the CHT.

Synonymous mutations are rare in thermoadapted mutants: none of the 13 SNSs in protein-coding regions in CP4-derived mutants (in total) and none of the 7 SNSs in protein-coding regions in W3110-derived mutants. Thus, the ratios of synonymous to nonsynonymous mutations are significantly less than the ratio of 24.9% expected by chance that is adapted from ref. 7. Thus, these data suggest a strong signal of adaptive evolution. The thermoadapted mutants obtained in this study bear 2&#x02013;15 mutations in protein-coding regions of genes, which are categorized into 6 groups (<xref rid="pone.0215614.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).

thermal adaptation. Frame-shift mutations by indels and Tn insertion in protein-coding regions would mostly generate negative or neutral effects on their thermoresistance. No large deletion was detected in this study, possible contributing to thermal adaptation as demonstrated in other bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0215614.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Preliminary experiments, in which individual mutations of CP4-derived thermoadapted mutants were introduced into the genome of the parental CP4 by the procedure similar to that for construction of mutators (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215614.s004">S4 Fig</xref>) after cloning each mutated gene into the pK18-attP plasmid (followed by confirmation by nucleotide sequencing), showed that most of single mutations in coding regions of genes for categories of general metabolism, membrane stabilization and transcriptional regulation (<xref rid="pone.0215614.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) improved the CHT by about 1 degree, which was determined by the two-step cultivation method in comparison with the corresponding thermoadapted mutant and CP4. These genes were ZCP4_1739 and ZCP4_0567 among 5 mutants tested for Z4-80a, ZCP4_0028 and ZCP4_1646 among 2 mutants tested for Z4-80b, ZCP4_1739 and ZCP4_0567 among 4 mutants tested for Z4-80c, and ZCP4_1739 and ZCP4_0588 among 3 mutants tested for Z4-80d (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215614.s008">S2 Table</xref>). Therefore, it is assumed that a few mutations among many mutations are valuable and beneficial for high-temperature tolerance characteristics and that effective mutations of these mutants are mostly gain-of-function mutations.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec018"><title>Discussion</title><p>Previous adaptation experiments were carried out by repetitive cultivations in minimum or rich media at fixed temperatures from 20&#x000b0;C to 42&#x000b0;C [<xref rid="pone.0215614.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0215614.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0215614.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] or by a stepwise increase in temperature to 45.5&#x000b0;C [<xref rid="pone.0215614.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] or 48.5&#x000b0;C [<xref rid="pone.0215614.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0215614.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and thermoadapted mutants isolated by a stepwise temperature upshift in a rich medium were shown to survive at equivalent high temperatures in a minimum medium [<xref rid="pone.0215614.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In this study using thermal adaptation experiments in a rich medium with two different species and three strains with distinct CHTs, there was an improvement in the CHTs up to 2 degrees (<xref rid="pone.0215614.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and application of mutators to further improve the CHT resulted in an increase of one more degree in the CHT of <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>mobilis</italic> TISTR 548, thus giving a total increase of 3 degrees in the CHT. The increase in CHT of 3 degrees may be close to the limit of thermal adaptation considering the application of a mutator. Therefore, it is assumed that the CHT improvement potential in the genome is around 3 degrees in these mesophiles. Although there is no information on generation speed or mutation rate in nature, an increase of 2&#x02013;3 degrees in global temperature is considered to have a strong impact on mesophiles and the ecosystems including these microbes.</p><p>In <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, cell density in a rich medium becomes 10-100-times higher than that in a minimum medium, while the mutation rates under phosphate- limited and carbon-limited conditions are 9-times and 6-times higher, respectively, than the mutation rate under a nutrient-sufficient condition [<xref rid="pone.0215614.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In nature, microbes may rarely be in a nutrient-rich environment and are generally exposed to conditions in which several nutrients are limited. Therefore, the mutation frequency in nature would be within the range of mutation rates in the background of a mismatch-repair defect (mismatch repair mutant), but acquisition of thermal adaptation is mainly dependent on chances to obtain nutrients for proliferation. On the other hand, thermal adaptation with multiple lines of the same parental strain provides an intriguing conjecture that there is a low diversity of thermal adaptation strategies. Two of the <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>mobilis</italic> thermoadapted mutants accumulated mutations in almost the same genes and the remaining two mutants exhibited similar phenotypes, though they had mutations in different genes. Two <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> thermoadapted mutants derived from 4 lines shared phenotypes and had mutations in the same or similar function-related genes. These findings lead us to speculate that the limited diversity for thermal adaptation decreases the chance for microbes to survival in the progress of global warming.</p><p>There are some key issues to be clarified. The period of adaptation in this study could be considered to be too short for acquisition of beneficial mutations. Thermoadaptation of more than 160 generations (about 400 generations in the case of TISTR548) was continued after reaching the upper limit temperature, but no more improvement of thermoresistance was found. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of accumulation of beneficial mutations in a much longer period of adaptation than that tested in this study. The thermal adaptation experiments performed in this study are very simple compared with complicated nature, in which there are seasonal temperature oscillations and spatial variation with regular cooler periods/places that are still suitable for the growth of mesophiles. Thus, if mesophiles in an area are continuously exposed to high temperatures in a range exceeding their CHTs for a duration that is sufficient to kill them, they will be removed from that area.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec019"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0215614.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Two-step cultivation for determination of CHT.</title><p>(A and B) Strains A and B are cultured in a rich medium at 37&#x000b0;C (A) and 38&#x000b0;C (B) as the first cultivation (straight lines).
