A facility is needed that can provide suitable combinations of different temperatures at reasonable cost for large plots.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">Here, an additional field warming facility option named the hot-blast warming facility (HBWF), which comprised heaters, blowers, wind breaks, and a control board was developed. An application case based on HBWF was carried out to assess elevated temperature effects on rice in Central China during 2015 and 2016. We tested four elevated temperature treatments on four rice cultivars under paddy field conditions and measured yield and its components. Heating convection air directly, the facility could increase the temperature of the rice canopy up to 1&#x02013;2 &#x000b0;C, which could properly simulate global warming. Considering the costs, the HBWF reduced the operating costs because of its relatively lower power consumption (0.164 kW/m<sup>2</sup>), which was 80% lower than that of Free Air Temperature Increase. Our results demonstrate that the HBWF could build a 25 m<sup>2</sup> homogeneous heating area and had little effect on the relative humidity under a paddy field environment. Warming treatments significantly reduced the grain yield by 4.4&#x02013;22.7% in 2015, and 30.8&#x02013;61.9% in 2016, compared to the control. The main contribution to the significant decrease of the grain yields was the decrease in seed setting rate. Moreover, a reduction of 1000-grain weight led to the decline in grain yield. The increasing ranges of the temperature simulated by HBWF were stable in different years, however, whether the elevated treatments demonstrated significant difference on rice growth mainly decided by the basic atmospheric temperature (as the control) during the growth period.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">The new warming facility is suitable for field trials to assess elevated temperature combinations and provides an extra equipment option for use in elevated temperature research in the future.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Climate change</kwd><kwd>Open-top chamber system (OTCs)</kwd><kwd>Convection heating</kwd><kwd>Wind break</kwd><kwd>Rice (<italic>Oryza sativa L.</italic>)</kwd><kwd>Grain yield</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31361140368</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Jianliang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par4">Global mean surface temperature will increase 0.3&#x02013;4.8 &#x000b0;C from 2081 to 2100, compared to that from 1986 to 2005 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Under global warming, not only the days and intensity of precipitation will change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], but also the increase of the daily maximum temperature is generally lower compared to the daily minimum temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It means that the daily temperature difference range (DTR) will decrease and the warming may also have an asymmetric effect. Previous reports based on crop models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and historical data analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] showed that warming during daytime and nighttime might significantly decrease crop yield. For instance, it&#x02019;s predicted that rice yield will decrease by 10% if the daily minimum temperature increases by 1 &#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. From 1981 to 2010, extreme temperature stress caused by global warming resulted in a loss of about 6.1% of irrigated rice yield [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and the yield per unit area of rice was reduced by 0.25 (0.01&#x02013;0.56) t hm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> 10 year<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, most previous studies are based on models or using pot experiments. Few studies were based on field experiments, so the actual crop production has not been exactly assessed yet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Investigating the actual responses of crop growth to different temperature increasing scenarios and the underlying mechanism will provide more certain information about the effects of global warming on crop production and more theoretical supports for ensuring food security under irreversible global warming trends.</p><p id="Par5">As one of the most important food crops globally, rice accounted for more than 25.8% of the total cereal production in 2017 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. It&#x02019;s of great significance to investigate the practical effect of climate warming on rice production. To date, due to the limitation of many conditions, most previous studies were conducted under controlled conditions, such as in greenhouses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] or open-top chambers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. These passive facilities are generally used to simulate elevated temperature to investigate crops&#x02019; responses in closed or semi-closed small spaces, not at the same scale as in field crop systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In this case, not only is the applied area is limited but also the daily temperature variation characteristics under natural conditions are changed. For the above reasons, it seems hard to simulate a natural environment to investigate the impact of future climate change on crop production. To overcome the deficiency of such facilities, some experts built the Free Air Temperature Increase (FATI) system, and it has been widely used to study plant responses to global warming at an ecosystem scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The FATI system mainly uses an infrared device to directly heat the foliage (not the air) in the field, which can provide good temperature control and has little change in the growth environment other than the warming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Rehmani [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] reported that FATI needs to deploy six infrared heaters with a power rating of 1 kW each to warm a hexagonal 7 m<sup>2</sup> plot. Too many heaters will not only produce high operating costs but also increase the number of cables in the field, which is not conducive for easy installation and disassembly. Moreover, the warming unit is completely open in the field, so its effect is more susceptible to the influence of climatic conditions such as rainfall and wind [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">For studying the impact of elevated temperatures on crop production, a site-specific test with several temperature treatments, combinations, and plot arrangements will provide more application value. However, it is difficult for existing heating facilities to satisfy the needs. To fill this gap and overcome the shortage of existing facilities, a hot-blast warming facility (HBWF) that could increase the temperature under field conditions by nearly 2 &#x000b0;C was developed based on the existing research results in our laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Herein, the assembly of the newly developed warming facility is provided in detail, and the advantages and disadvantages are also discussed. Moreover, a warming experiment with the HBWF on middle-season rice in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River was conducted to verify the feasibility of this equipment during 2015 and 2016. The objectives of this trial are developing the HBWF and testing its efficacy for assessing warming effects on rice in the field, and then provide a reliable research method to cope with the warming effect for future crop production.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Assembly of the hot-blast warming facility (HBWF)</title><p id="Par7">The HBWF installation began after transplanting rice in the paddy field. First, two blowers with heaters were fixed on a cement ridge at opposite ends of each plot by screws (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Second, a pipe was connected to each blower as a heat vent to form a single heating unit (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). A temperature sensor (12-Bit Temp Smart Sensor S-TMB-017, sensor was sheltered from rain, sunlight and other environmental conditions by utilizing solar radiation shields to achieve more precise data about temperature and relative humidity) was installed in the center of a plot (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). Finally, a wind break comprised of four rigid transparent plastic walls (composed of polycarbonate, with high light transmission and less durable) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) was installed around the edges of the warmed plot (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). The farmland hot-blast warming facility increased the temperature by blowing hot air into the plot and was mainly composed of four parts: the control board, heating device, wind break and temperature measuring/monitoring unit.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Process of the hot-blast warming facility (HBWF) installation in the field. <bold>a</bold> soil preparation for rice transplanting, <bold>b</bold>: installation of blower and heater after transplanting, <bold>c</bold> installing heat vent pipe, <bold>d</bold> installation of transparent plastic walls and temperature sensors as the last step</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13007_2020_598_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Control board</title><p id="Par8">The control board (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a) controlled a group of heating devices by a timer with a microcomputer (ZYT11, Toone Electronic LTD, Shanghai, China) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c) and supplied power to the test area according to the various temperature treatments separately. A three-phase supply (380 V) was connected through the main switch to meet the electricity demand. To ensure the safety of the heating system during operation, some electrical components were installed in the electrical control cabinet with a length, width and height of 70 cm, 40 cm, and 180 cm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e), respectively. The installed electrical components included the main switch (CDM1-225L/3300, Delixi Electric LTD, Zhejiang, China) and circuit breaker (with functions of short circuit, overload and isolation) (DZ47-125, Delixi Electric LTD, Zhejiang, China) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b), a relay control (CDC1-25-30-10, Delixi Electric LTD, Zhejiang, China) for each set of heating equipment and a miniature circuit breaker (DZ47-C32, Delixi Electric LTD, Zhejiang, China) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d). Moreover, the electrical control cabinet and the heater in the heating device were all grounded by an earth wire. The cables from the control cabinet to the blower were all wrapped by PVC pipes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b) as conduits for laying, and the blower was covered with stainless steel rainproof herringbone plates (Figs. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>h, <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>e) to avoid potential danger. The installation of the circuits and connecting equipment must be performed by professional electricians, so a local equipment installation company needed to employed when installing the HBWF.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Internal structure of the electric control cabinet. <bold>a</bold> circuit design in the electric control cabinet, <bold>b</bold> main switch for power supply and main leakage protector, <bold>c</bold> time switch with a microcomputer, <bold>d</bold> relay control for each set of heating equipment and branch leakage protector, <bold>e</bold> external picture of the electric control cabinet</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13007_2020_598_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig><fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Components of heating equipment. <bold>a</bold> blower, <bold>b</bold> heater, <bold>c</bold> heating resistance wire, <bold>d</bold> heat vent pipe, <bold>e</bold> blower and heater, <bold>f</bold> steel rings, <bold>g</bold> rubber pad, <bold>h</bold> stainless steel herringbone rainproof, <bold>i</bold> bolt</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13007_2020_598_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Heating device</title><p id="Par9">The heating device comprised of a blower (rated power 0.55 kW, 220 V, CZR80, Yongqiang Ventilation System LTD, Guangdong, China) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a), a heater (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b) and a heat vent pipe (Figs. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d, <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>f) made up a heating device. The rotation speed of the blower is 2800 rpm, and the airflow and the wind pressure from the blower are 18 m<sup>3</sup> min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 1.7 kpa, respectively. The blower and heater were integrated through a rubber pad (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>g), bolts (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>i) and steel rings with holes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>f), as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e. According to our technical requirements, the heater was assembled by a local company and the heat vent pipes were made by common materials in the market. The heater consisted of resistance heating wire with cooling fins (resistance of 25 &#x003a9; and rated power of 1.5 kW, 220 V) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c) and a stainless steel pipe projecting outward (length of 0.7 m, the diameter of 13 cm). The heating resistance wire was powered by two insulated wires (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e) coated with high temperature-resistant rubber, and the entire heater needed to be grounded by an earth wire to ensure safety. The heat vent pipe was a high-pressure PVC-U pipe (Goody Science &#x00026; Technology LTD, Hubei, China) with a thickness of 4 mm, an external diameter of 11 cm and a length of 4.5 m. The terminal of the heat vent pipe was blocked, and the pipe ran across the plot at a height of 20 cm over the ground. Twenty-one round air holes (approx. 2.5 cm in diameter) were drilled on each side of the pipe, parallel to the ground. When the wind speed is higher, the pressure is lower, so it is more difficult for thermal air to flow out when it is closer to the blower. Therefore, the distance between the holes gradually increased as follows from the blower to the end of the pipe: 16 cm, 16 cm, 17 cm, 17 cm, 18 cm,18 cm, 18 cm,19 cm, 19 cm,19 cm, 20 cm, 20 cm, 21 cm, 21 cm, 21 cm, 22 cm, 22 cm, 22 cm, 23 cm, 23 cm, 24 cm, 24 cm, 25 cm and 25 cm. This was to facilitate the uniform outflow of thermal air in a horizontal direction and increase the temperature of the plots. Also, the wind speed measured by an anemometer was nearly 0 at different heights perpendicular to the ground during the operation of the equipment. Each warming plot was equipped with two sets of heating devices, and they were positioned relative to each other with an adjacent distance of 2.5 m. In this case, the total power of each heating unit (25 m<sup>2</sup>) was 4.1 kW.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Wind break and temperature measuring device</title><p id="Par10">To maintain constant elevated temperatures inside the plot, four high transparent plastic walls (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) with a height of 1.1 m, a side length of 5 m and a thickness of 7 mm were used as a wind break or heat preservation device to slow the loss of heat from just blowing freely away. The wind breaks surrounded all of the various treated main plots (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c). In effect, each plot was a large open-top chamber, albeit much wider than others described in the literature. Furthermore, each transparent plastic wall was fixed with 4&#x02013;5 bamboo poles with a height of 1.2 m to prevent being blown over by the wind. Every plot formed a heating cell from the initiation of the elevated temperature treatments until the harvesting time. Ambient plots were in similar design to the heated plots except without any heating devices. During the operation of this facility, the contribution of the transparent plastic walls is limited to the warming effect by comparing the average air temperature in the control plot (29.7 &#x000b0;C) and the natural rice filed (29.5 &#x000b0;C) from 28/07 to 10/08 in 2017.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Commodity figure and real products figure about the transparent plastic walls</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13007_2020_598_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig><fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Top view of the verification test in the field. <bold>a</bold> electric control cabinet, <bold>b</bold> main electric cables laid in a PVC pipe (shown by the yellow line in the picture), <bold>c</bold> transparent plastic walls, <bold>d</bold> temperature sensors in the polt, <bold>e</bold> blower with herringbone rain shield, <bold>f</bold> heat vent pipe for warming air</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13007_2020_598_Fig5_HTML" id="MO5"/></fig></p><p id="Par11">A HOBO Micro Station data logger (H21&#x02013;002) and temperature sensors (12-Bit Temp Smart Sensor S-TMB-017, which could monitor temperatures from &#x02212;&#x02009;40 to 100 &#x000b0;C, Onset Computer Corporation, Massachusetts, USA) were the main components of the temperature monitoring device. The sensor was placed in the center of the main plot (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d) and sheltered from rain, sunlight and other environmental conditions by utilizing louvered solar radiation shields to achieve more precise data. The canopy air temperature and relative humidity were recorded at 5-min intervals, and data were collected once every 30 days.

In the warming plot, the temperature increased in points A, C, and E in the daytime were approximately 1 &#x000b0;C, while the temperature increased in points B and D were approximately 0.6 &#x000b0;C, which were smaller than those of points A, C and E. In contrast, the amplitudes of nighttime temperature enhancement were significantly higher than those of the daytime, but the characteristics of the increase at each site were the same as those in the daytime. The asymmetry of elevated temperature in daytime and nighttime under the future global warming trends was simulated precisely.

The facility completely avoids the solar radiation shading effects by infrared heaters and makes up for the deficiency observed in other methods to simulate air convection heating while not altering the spectral characteristics.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Temperature increase</title><p id="Par22">Our data show that the new-type of warming facility had a conspicuous warming effect in the field that could raise the air temperature in the rice canopy by 1.0&#x02013;2.1 &#x000b0;C (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Similar temperature enhancements were achieved in some previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. According to inference by the IPCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], the temperature increment is appropriate in the HBWF and is in line with the predicted range of atmospheric temperature increases in China in the next few decades. In a warming unit, the vertical temperature gradient was studied and the results indicated that the temperature decreases with the height increasing. From 55 cm to 75 cm, there&#x02019;s about a 2 &#x000b0;C drop in temperature. Although we formed a relatively closed space through the rice plants and transparent plastic walls (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), the hot air flows from the lower part of the rice to the canopy, so there are a certain lag and heat dissipation during the facility operation. Besides, it could show the characteristics of asymmetry about global warming in the daytime and nighttime (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In the context of global warming, the ascending range of the highest temperature in the daytime is much lower than that of the lowest temperature at night [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and there are enormous differences in the impact of elevated temperatures on rice between daytime and nighttime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. So this feature is undoubtedly important for a warming trial in the field. During the daytime and nighttime, the facility could raise the air temperature in the rice canopy by 0.6&#x02013;1.5 &#x000b0;C and 1.3&#x02013;2.2 &#x000b0;C, respectively (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). It satisfied the requirement of field warming experiments well. Under the HBWF, there was significant variation of temperature increment in diurnal mean temperature of rice canopy among the treatments (AW&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;NW&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;DW) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>b, d) and the trends of diurnal temperature variation dynamics under warming treatments were nearly consistent with the natural control (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>a, c). Such warming circumstances can better reflect the actual changes in rice plants under future climate change. However, the warming effect of the facility will be affected by the foundational atmospheric temperature between different years. The research results show that the temperature increment of each warming treatment in 2015 was higher than that in 2016 (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). According to the temperature record under 2 years of natural conditions, the average atmospheric temperature in 2016 was higher than that in 2015, and the number of days with high temperature (&#x02265;&#x02009;35 &#x000b0;C) in 2016 was 37 days (data not shown), which was much higher than that in 2015. This may be the causes for the difference in the warming effect of the facility in 2 years. If the facility is to continue to be used in field trials with a steady warming effect in elevated temperature, the above changes may warrant attention and improvement (e.g., by increasing the power of the heater).</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Relative humidity</title><p id="Par23">Among common environmental factors, not only temperature but also humidity can affect the growth and development of rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. One problem that had been identified in the heating experiment with infrared heaters (FATI) is that the vapor pressure gradients (VPGs) from inside the leaves to the air outside would not be the same as would be expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Therefore, we investigated the changes in relative humidity over the whole growth period of each main plot in this trial. The findings regarding relative air humidity imply that the absolute value of relative humidity fluctuated very little between the four temperature treatments, despite the relative humidity of the rice canopy being significantly different among the different treatments (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Moreover, we calculated the average relative humidity of natural air during the rice-growing season of 2015&#x02013;2016. The relative humidity were 75.2% and 72.0% in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Meanwhile, humidity varied in the range of 79&#x02013;87% in 2015 and 80&#x02013;84% in 2016, which were a higher humidity level and were all bigger than the average relative humidity of natural air. It&#x02019;s demonstrated that although the vapor pressure deficit in the air will vary, the changes are very limited in the paddy field when the air is heated directly by simulating convective heating.</p><p id="Par24">For this problem with VPGs, Kimball [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] proposed that irrigation can be used to compensate for the water lost in the ecosystem as a first-order correction. In this assessing study, there was adequate moisture present in the field of the irrigated rice system because the paddy field was flooded in a long term. As a consequence, the HBWF has a limited impact on the relative humidity of the heated plot under the paddy field. Until now, this facility was only used in a rice planting system, and land surface temperature and soil moisture were not investigated in this paper because we maintained flood irrigation management during the growth period. If we want to study the response of wheat and other dryland crops to elevated temperatures, we would need to consider the influence of temperature enhancement on soil temperature, air humidity, soil moisture content and so on just like Wan et al.

In the HBWF, the role of PID and IRTs are replaced by transparent plastic walls. Four transparent plastic walls forming a wind break were installed as a thermal insulation device around each plot and formed a relatively closed space for the rice plants (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). This heating method with active and passive characteristics not only simplified the equipment layout but also isolated adjacent areas so they did not affect each other. This also saved space and improved the land utilization effectiveness of the field block. Nevertheless, in early stages of the growth, the plants close to the walls were also taller, indicative of less mechanical disturbance by wind. These effects were taken into account to ensure the accuracy of the trials when sampling. Additionally, the same position perpendicular to the direction of the pipe was selected for each destructive sampling, and the original position was filled by transplanting other marked rice plants after sampling to ensure the tightness of the group space and avoid the border effect. After the HBWF was started, access into the warming unit should be reduced as far as possible to avoid the interference of human factors.</p><p id="Par26">Currently, a FATI system needed to deploy six infrared heaters with a rated power of 1 kW to form an effective warming unit with an area of 7 m<sup>2</sup> in the paddy field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. It consumed approximately 0.85 kW per square meter. This meant that if we wanted to use the FATI system to complete a warming test, we would have a high cost of operating. In contrast, the HBWF consumed only approximately 0.165 kW per square meter and reduced operating costs by 80% because it doesn&#x02019;t operate in free air. Furthermore, installation convenience, facility security, and thermal insulation of the new equipment were greatly improved compared to those of predecessors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In the HBWF, the heater, blower, and rainproof cover were all connected and fixed by screws, and the cables of the equipment were arranged into PVC pipes in advance. Compared with the FATI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], the HBWF was easy to install and remove due to the cables and components were greatly reduced. Nevertheless, due to the facility running in a field environment, its line laying was installed by professional electricians based on the field design, and its daily maintenance and management were also handled by the professional and technical personnel. Also, the facility should be turned off to improve safety when sampling, although a variety of electrical leakage protection measures (Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, d, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e, h) were taken during operation. However, it is undeniable that when the new warming facility is used to conduct a warming experiment during the whole growing period of crops, higher electricity costs will be generated (for example, the total energy consumption in our trial is 70,848 kW h in 90 days). Therefore, it would be more feasible to consider multi-party cooperation or to select a specific growth period of crops for a warming experiment for laboratories with insufficient funds. Overall, the hot-blast warming facility was suitable for the fixed-point test with several temperature treatments, combinations, and plot arrangements and can be used for many years.

Here, our trials demonstrate that a temperature variation of approximately 2 &#x000b0;C can lead to significant yield losses (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). The experimental results were consistent with the reduction trend predicted by previous models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. During both years, the maximum decrease in grain yield was recorded under AW treatments. In 2015 and 2016, the yield in the AW treatment was reduced by 10&#x02013;35% and 42&#x02013;79%, respectively. The conspicuous reduction of AW was ascribed to the uninterrupted elevated temperatures for the diel (24 h), which formed a superposition effect of the DW and NW treatments and resulted in a comparatively higher cumulative temperature at the end of the growth period. Such a reduction in yield with an all-day temperature increase had been already reported in various investigations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], but Dong et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] reported that the rice yield was decreased only by 0.9% under AW, which was far less than the decrease of yield under DW and NW. These differences might be attributed to the interannual differences in the natural temperature of the atmosphere, which led to the stronger or weaker responses of rice to the elevated temperatures. Our results of both years confirmed this inference. Meanwhile, ecotypes of the tested rice and other environmental factors such as radiation, relative humidity, and rainfall have impacted the growth of rice in a season, leading to the differences in results obtained from different studies. The reduction of yield in four cultivars in DW and NW was less than in AW, but the adverse impacts of these cultivars were consistent. The effect of DW and NW on the rice yield during 2015 was not significant, while DW and NW significantly decreased the rice yield of four cultivars in 2016. Peng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] reported that grain yield declined by 10% for each 1 &#x000b0;C increase in the nighttime temperature, while daytime temperature had an inconspicuous influence on the rice yield. In 2016, the yield was reduced by 18&#x02013;55% when the nighttime temperature increased by 2 &#x000b0;C, which was approximately similar to Peng&#x02019;s result. However, the DW treatment diminished the grain yield by 20&#x02013;52% in 2016, which was different from the results of Peng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. We speculated that this difference was mainly ascribed to the natural temperature level in 2016 is higher than that of the past years. According to the temperature data under 2 years of natural conditions, the number of days with high temperature (&#x02265;&#x02009;35 &#x000b0;C) was 37 days and there was a period of high temperature during the 55&#x02013;65 days after transplanting in 2016 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>d), which coincided with the flowering period of rice. This meant that the frequency of suffering high-temperature stress increased for rice plants in the DW treatment and aggravated the high-temperature stress response. The responses of the four indica ecotypes to warming treatments were also significantly different. Our results demonstrated that the performance of LYPJ was the worst; simultaneously, SY63 and YLY6 showed more tolerance than the other two genotypes under elevated temperatures (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). In the same ecotype, the two-line hybrid rice LYPJ possessed relatively more sensitive to temperature increments than other cultivars. Furthermore, Shah et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] revealed that japonica ecotypes were much more sensitive to heat stress than indica ecotypes concerning yield. Thus, an effective way to reduce the detrimental effects of high temperatures is by selecting and breeding high temperature-resistant varieties from different ecological types and determining the genetic differences of the varieties with different temperature sensitivity in response to a warming climate.</p><p id="Par28">Rice grain yield is determined by four parameters: number of panicles per plant, number of spikelets per panicle, grain filling rate and total grain weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. With global warming, the increase in the maximum daily temperature will significantly increase the frequency of suffering from high-temperature stress for rice during the day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], which is not conducive to the reproductive growth of rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] and seriously affects the seed setting rate and the 1000-grain weight of rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. By analyzing the yield composition factors of the four varieties during 2015 and 2016, it can be found that the decrease in rice yield was mainly caused by a decrease in the seed setting rate, followed by a decrease in the 1000-grain weight (Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). In 2016, an approximately 60% reduction in the seed setting rate was observed in LYPJ and HHZ under AW treatment. In contrast, although the 1000-grain weight of rice was significantly reduced by 5% under the different warming treatments, especially the AW treatment, it did not contribute much to the grain yield reduction. Hubei Province, as the main producing area of middle-season rice in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, is prone to encounter high-temperature stress during the fertile flowering period under warming weather, which will inhibit pollen activity, anther cracking, and stigma pollen germination, leading to a high sterility of spikelets and a reduced seed setting rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Under the trend that the average atmospheric temperature will continue to rise in the future with climate warming, it can be predicted that rice production in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River will face a severe test based on the results of this study. In this context, it is of great significance to design stable and reliable field warming facilities and observe an accurate simulation of future climate change. The area of temperature increase in the HBWF is sufficiently large to meet the needs of multiple samples, and an in-depth exploration can be conducted on the internal mechanisms between rice yield composition factors and the temperature increases in the future research. Not only that, it&#x02019;s convenient to explore the role of field cultivation means such as fertilization and irrigation in alleviating the temperature increase effects through the new warming facility.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par29">An additional field warming facility option named as hot-blast warming facility (HBWF), which comprising heaters, blowers, wind breaks, and a control board was developed. The modular design of the facility facilitated the installation and disassembly of different devices, which also greatly improves the safety of the equipment. The farmland hot-blast warming facility could raise the temperature to 1&#x02013;2 &#x000b0;C in the rice canopy without changing the diurnal variation characteristics and formed form an effective warming unit with an abundant area. The warming units are independent of each other, which enables carrying out multiple elevated temperature treatments for different crops in the limited experimental land at the same time. Furthermore, the HBWF had little effect on relative humidity in paddy field and could simulate convection heating by directly heating air. The power consumption per square meter in the warming plot was reduced due to the adoption of heat preservation equipment. In the validation trial, the facility stably provided uniformly controlled warming plots, and it provided reproducible results under field conditions. Among all treatments, the AW caused the most adverse effects, and the day and night temperature augmentation caused the same degree of adverse effects. The primary cause for the significant decrease in rice yield in 2 years was a decrease in the seed setting rate, followed by a decrease in the 1000-grain weight. In general, the hot-blast warming facility developed in this experiment and the resultant data from rice planted in middle-season are of great reference value to predict the specific changes of rice under the future climate warming and to propose feasible countermeasures accordingly.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec21"><title>Site description</title><p id="Par30">Field warming experiments were conducted during July&#x02013;October in 2015&#x02013;2016 using a hot-blast facility at Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China (30&#x000b0; 50&#x02032; N latitude, 114&#x000b0; 33&#x02032; E longitude).

Sterilized seed of all four cultivars was germinated and then sown on 11th May and 17th May for the nursery rearing in 2015 and 2016, respectively. One month after sowing, three seedlings per hill were transplanted manually with a hill spacing of 16.7 cm&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;20.0 cm in mid-June.

All of the P, half of the K and 40% of N were applied as a basal dressing 1 day before transplanting, while the residual nitrogen was equally split at the mid-tillering stage and the panicle initiation stages, and the other 50% of the potassium was top-dressed during panicle initiation.
