However, wheat production and quality will scarcely fulfill forward demands, which are compounded by high-temperature (HT) events as heatwaves, increasingly common in Portugal. Thus, landraces assume crucial importance as potential reservoirs of useful traits for wheat breeding and may be pre-adapted to extreme environmental conditions. This work evaluates four Portuguese landrace yield and grain composition through attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, particularly protein content, and their responses to HT treatment mimicking a heatwave. Landraces showed distinct yield traits, especially plant height and first spike grain number, and a similar pattern in FTIR spectra, although revealing differences in grain components&#x02019; proportions. Comparison between spectra band intensity indicates that Ardito has the highest protein-related peaks, contrary to Magueija, which appears to be the landrace with higher lipid content. In plants submitted to 1 week of HT treatment 10 days after anthesis, the first spike grain size and weight were markedly reduced in all landraces. Additionally, it was observed that a general increase in grain protein content in the four landraces, being the increment observed in Ardito and Gr&#x000e9;cia, is statistically significant. The comparative assessment of control and HT average FTIR spectra denoted also the occurrence of alterations in grain polysaccharide composition. An integrated assessment of the evaluations performed revealed that Ardito and Magueija landraces presented diverse yield-related characteristics and distinct responses to cope with HT. In fact, the former landrace revealed considerable grain yield diminution along with an increase in grain protein proportion after HT, while the latter showed a significant increase in spikes and grain number, with grain quality detriment. These results reinforce the relevance of scrutinizing old genotype diversity seeking for useful characteristics, particularly considering HT impact on grain production and quality.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>bread wheat</kwd><kwd>landraces</kwd><kwd>heatwave</kwd><kwd>yield</kwd><kwd>grain composition</kwd><kwd>protein content</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o para a Ci&#x000ea;ncia e a Tecnologia<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001871</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o para a Ci&#x000ea;ncia e a Tecnologia<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001871</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn003">Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o para a Ci&#x000ea;ncia e a Tecnologia<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001871</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn004">Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o para a Ci&#x000ea;ncia e a Tecnologia<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001871</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn005">Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o para a Ci&#x000ea;ncia e a Tecnologia<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001871</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="44"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) is a major cereal consumed worldwide on a daily basis (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">FAO, 2017</xref>). However, the global mean growth rate of wheat is not sufficient to cover the production predicted to be necessary in 2050 (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Ray et al., 2013</xref>), and one of this limitation causes is the progressive global warming (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Gaupp et al., 2019</xref>). In fact, the increase in mean temperature during wheat development was predicted to reduce grain production (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Asseng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Major effects of high temperature (HT) on wheat plants include decrease in pollen viability, plant cycle shortening, as well as deterioration of chlorophyll and reduction of photochemical efficiency with consequent grain number diminution and kernel shrinkage (reviewed in <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Akter and Islam, 2017</xref>). Temperatures above 30&#x000b0;C after anthesis, in the early stages of grain filling, accelerate plant development leading to smaller and shrunken grains (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Altenbach et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). This reduction in grain development time caused by heat decreases starch and protein deposition, affecting grain composition and final quality (reviewed in <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Farooq et al., 2011</xref>). Several reports suggested that a HT induces higher grain protein content as kernel size is smaller, and this augment seems to be more pronounced when HTs are imposed in early stages of grain filling (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Corbellini et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Daniel and Triboi, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Castro et al., 2007</xref>). However, distinct stress responses were registered in different wheat genotypes commercially available with a reduction in both kernel weight and protein content in some varieties (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Tom&#x000e1;s et al., 2020a</xref>). In this context, it is particularly relevant to comparatively assess the variability of distinct commercial varieties (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Pradhan et al., 2019</xref>) and also, more importantly, the old and traditional landraces, considering the eroded genetic pool of commercial varieties that resulted from decades of homogenization through breeding.</p><p>Landraces provided notable successes in crop improvement (reviewed in <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Dwivedi et al., 2016</xref>). Wheat landraces, defined as a traditional varieties with potential higher tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses, present better yield stability under low input agricultural system (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Zeven, 1998</xref>). Thus, landraces may constitute extremely valuable agrobiodiversity pools assuming a prominent role in the actual unpredictable weather conditions (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Lopes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Alipour et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The effects of extreme heat events particularly frequent in Portugal, like heatwaves (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Cardoso et al., 2019</xref>), defined as five or more consecutive days of heat in which the daily maximum temperature is at least 5&#x000b0;C higher than the average maximum temperature (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">WMO, 2015</xref>), have been studied in wheat commercial varieties. Those reports showed that HT treatments mimetizing heatwaves during grain filling leads to lower intervarietal diversity in transcription levels of genes related to grain quality and in the proportions of distinct protein fractions (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Tom&#x000e1;s et al., 2020b</xref>), as well as in grain polysaccharide composition and global protein content (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Tom&#x000e1;s et al., 2020a</xref>). Thus, it is crucial to assess the biodiversity enclosed in landraces to cope with a broad range of environmental conditions. The objective of this work was to assess the effect of a short period of HT during grain filling in distinct Portuguese landraces on grain yield and composition with special focus on protein content as one of the most determinant parameters of grain quality. Our results revealed distinct responses to HT treatment concerning most yield parameters, except grain weight, and a concordant general increase in protein content and reduction in starch amount. Additionally, landraces presenting distinct responses to HT treatment imposed during grain filling were identified.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2.SS1"><title>Plant Material</title><p>Bread wheat (<italic>T. aestivum</italic> L., 2n = 6 &#x000d7; = 42, AABBDD) old Portuguese landraces from Vasconcellos collection, established in the 1930s of the last century (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Vasconcellos, 1933</xref>), were used in this work&#x02014;Ardito, Gr&#x000e9;cia, Magueija e Ruivo.

Flours ATR-FTIR spectra were recorded with a Bruker-P Alpha spectrometer (Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany) equipped with a single-reflection diamond ATR (attenuated total reflection) accessory. The spectra were obtained between 4,000 and 400 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> with a resolution of 4 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, and each spectrum was the average of 24 scans corresponding to technical replicates.

Magueija HT treated plants showed an average area significantly higher (31%) than the control ones and the comparison between landraces submitted to HT conditions indicates that this value (1,166.37 cm<sup>2</sup>) is significantly higher than other landrace plant areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>Considering the average number of spikes per plant kept in control conditions, Magueija and Ruivo presented the lowest average values (6.9 and 6.5, respectively), significantly different than the highest average number (9.6) shown by Gr&#x000e9;cia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). The comparison of the average number of spikes between control and HT-treated plants revealed a significant difference only in Magueija, with a remarkable increase of 72%, (from 6.9 to 11.9). Also, the comparison between landraces submitted to HT treatment revealed that Magueija plants showed a significantly higher number of spikes in comparison with all other genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). The number of spikes was moreover influenced by the appearance of new tillers after the HT treatment period, during ripening, with subsequent additional spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>).

The comparison between landraces submitted to HT treatment showed that Ardito has the significantly higher number of grains/spike of all landraces (47) and a higher grain weight/spike (0.99 g) than Gr&#x000e9;cia and Ruivo.

A very weak band, in some cases only a shoulder, located at 1,745 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, could be from C = O stretching from lipids that if present at all would be in a very small percentage.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>FIGURE 3</label><caption><p>Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) average spectra of Ardito (dark blue), Gr&#x000e9;cia (green), Magueija (light blue), and Ruivo (red) <bold>(A)</bold> control and <bold>(B)</bold> HT samples with the assignment of relevant bands.

This analysis unravels that Ardito has a more intense spectra than Magueija and Ruivo in half of the selected bands, including the band with maximum at 3,294 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> assigned to starch polymer and Amides I and II bands. On the contrary, the average spectrum of grains from Magueija control plants was the most intense at the 1,745 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> band (probably related with fat), and 2,927, 929, and 848 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> starch-related bands. Globally, only for the Amide I, the four spectra are clearly separated, while for the other selected bands, at least two spectra have similar absorbance intensities.</p><p>The comparison of maximum intensity at selected wavenumber between the average spectra of grains from control and HT = treated plants, after min-max normalization is shown in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Overall, the spectra of grains from HT-treated plants are more intense than the ones obtained from grains of control plants for all four landraces. The only exceptions to these were the more intense Gr&#x000e9;cia and Magueija control spectra in the band with a maximum at 3,294 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, mainly assigned to O&#x02013;H stretching from the starch polymer. Amide I and II proteins bands are the ones that revealed more relevant differences between control and HT. In fact, the intensity of HT Ardito and Gr&#x000e9;cia spectra is much higher than the control ones in both Amide bands, as well as in Ruivo regarding Amide I band. This increase in protein content is expected to be associated with a proportional reduction in starch grain content, as these are the main components of wheat grain, and the spectra normalization was done by the more intense band at 997 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, associated with starch. Although Ardito HT spectrum is also quite more intense than the control one in bands with a maximum at 1,149 and 1,077 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, and Gr&#x000e9;cia presented a greater difference between the control and HT spectra in 1,077 and 929 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> bands, in both cases, the bands are associated with starch. These alterations suggest that the proportions of distinct polysaccharides may also be altered after HT treatment. Last, based on the 1,745-cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> band, the lipid fraction increases slightly in grains from HT-treated plants of Ardito, Gr&#x000e9;cia, and Ruivo.</p><table-wrap id="T1"

On its turn, Ardito responds to HT privileging plant growth, increasing plant height, but reducing grain yield, with spike length, and both grain number and weight reduced in treated plants. Concerning grain composition, a significant increase in protein content was observed and, allied to the reduction in grain size and weight, foresee a reduction in grain starch amount.

Facing a global warming scenario, these advantages are even more relevant for essential crops like bread wheat considering the projections of insufficient cereal production to meet the demand in a few decades (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Ray et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Gaupp et al., 2019</xref>). In this context, the invaluable resource encompassed in the wheat old traditional landraces collected in the 1930s of the last century by <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Vasconcellos (1933)</xref> in Portugal fields assume special relevance. In this work, we studied four of these bread wheat landraces evaluating their yield and grain quality modulation by a HT treatment mimicking a heatwave during grain filling. This particular extreme heat event was predicted to be intensified onward especially in Portugal (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Cardoso et al., 2019</xref>). Yield parameters and grain composition were comparatively evaluated in landrace plants kept in control conditions and HT treated.</p><p>The evaluation of the four landraces showed considerable intervariety diversity since significant differences were detected in all yield parameters analyzed in control plants, especially in the number of spikes, grain number, and plant height, the latter being significantly different between all the landraces. The variability disclosed in the number of grains per spike contrasts with the complete homogeneity observed in this parameter of grain yield observed in bread wheat commercial varieties (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Tom&#x000e1;s et al., 2020a</xref>). On the other hand, the diversity disclosed in the number of spikes contrasts also with the lack of diversity reported in commercial genotypes (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Khan and Naqvi, 2011</xref>). Ardito landrace stands out as the one with the lower plant height and area along with the higher grain number and weight in the first spike, characteristics close to the desired for commercial varieties (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Khush, 1999</xref>). Globally, the yield parameters are similar to other European landraces previously studied (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Dotla&#x000e8;il et al., 2003</xref>). Unexpectedly, two landraces (Magueija and Gr&#x000e9;cia) 10 grain weight was higher (0.44 g) than the higher value reported for commercial varieties recommended to be used in Portugal (0.38 g) assessed in similar assays (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Tom&#x000e1;s et al., 2020a</xref>). Concerning the average protein content, the values obtained in the landraces studied, ranging from 10.3 to 19.7% (control condition), were similar to the ones assessed in commercial varieties through the same methodology (between 9.5 and 21.4%, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Tom&#x000e1;s et al., 2020a</xref>). It is relevant that although these landraces were not submitted to breeding programs, their values of protein content are very acceptable and similar to the ones reported for commercial varieties. Recently, the screening of Pakistani wheat landraces also found several traditional genotypes with high storage protein concentration, pointing out their potential to improve the nutritional quality of modern wheat commercial genotypes (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Mughal et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, different landraces studied in our work revealed distinct responses to HT traduced even in opposite effects in most yield parameters evaluated. The evaluation of the plant height of Ardito and Ruivo, and the area of Magueija revealed significant differences between the control and HT plants. As plant area is often used as plant biomass predictor (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Armonien&#x000e9; et al., 2018</xref>), our results indicate that Magueija increase in biomass may compromise grain filling, as in this plant development phase, all plant resources should be directed to grain. Both number of spikes per plant and first spike length showed a significant difference between the control and HT plants in Ardito and Magueija, although HT induced differences in the first spike length in opposite ways in these two landraces. Additionally, the increase in Magueija number of spikes induced by HT treatment was mainly due to the appearance of new tillers with spike during ripening. The appearance of these late tillers was observed in all the landraces, in both control and HT-treated plants. It must be emphasized that late spikes were never observed in commercial varieties previously assayed in similar conditions (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Tom&#x000e1;s et al., 2020a</xref>). Moreover, extemporaneous tiller appearance was described in some wheat varieties but only until the beginning of stem elongation (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Bowden et al., 2007</xref>). We speculate that this phenomenon can constitute a strategy to assure descendance in extreme conditions.</p><p>The less affected yield parameter was grain number since it was the only one that did not reveal significant differences between the control and HT-treated plants in any of the genotypes assessed, in opposition to 10-grain weight, which was significantly lower in HT-treated plants of all four landraces. This is in accordance with some previous works that reported that grain number is mostly affected by HT treatments imposed before fertilization, while elevated temperature occurring during grain filling is known to shorten developing period and lead to shrunken grains (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Stone and Nicolas, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Farooq et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Talukder et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Tao et al., 2018</xref>). Although an increase in assimilate supply was reported in this phase, it was not sufficient to fully compensate the shorter duration of grain filling period (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Lobell et al., 2012</xref>). Contrary to this uniform effect on grain weight observed in all landraces analyzed, some previous works revealed different HT effects in grain weight between distinct genotypes (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Scotti-Campos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Tom&#x000e1;s et al., 2020a</xref>). Globally, the comparative evaluation of yield-related traits between genotypes in the control and HT treatment plants showed that parameters determinant for grain yield like spike number and 10-grain weight presented high variability in both developmental conditions assayed.</p><p>Concerning grain composition evaluated by ATR-FTIR, all spectra here obtained were similar to the ones already described in <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Tom&#x000e1;s et al. (2020a)</xref> for commercial wheat varieties and were concordant with the main components of wheat grain&#x02014;starch and proteins (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Shewry, 2009</xref>). The balance between starch and the other components suggests that grains from Ardito plants have higher protein content than the other four landraces, especially due to the contribution of Amide I (1,648 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>). Lipid fraction constitutes only 3&#x02013;4% of the whole grain (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Wrigley et al., 2009</xref>), and in our work, it is negligible as the embryo, which is responsible for one-third of the wheat grain lipid fraction that was removed before grain milling. Nevertheless, the comparison between average spectra shows that Magueija grains have the higher fat amount.</p><p>Overall, spectra from HT-treated samples were more intense than the control ones in all the landraces, indicating an increase in protein content and a decrease in starch. These results are in accordance with model predicted protein content, which shows a significant increase in Ardito and Gr&#x000e9;cia grains from HT-treated plants and with previous works (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">DuPont et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Tao et al., 2018</xref>). Also, an increase in protein content should be related with a decrease in starch content and this is in accordance with the decrease in 10-grain weight and grain size previously observed and with other studies showing that HTs affect the starch synthesis in wheat grain (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Hurkman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Tom&#x000e1;s et al., 2020b</xref>). A shift between landrace spectra in bands mainly assigned to starch suggests that also the proportions of different polysaccharides are altered as the effect of HT treatment. This effect was also observed in commercial genotypes submitted to similar HT treatments (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Tom&#x000e1;s et al., 2020a</xref>).</p><p>After HT treatment, the significant increase in Ardito protein amount was also reflected in the greater distance between this landrace and the other ones regarding maximum intensity at Amide I and II bands. Also, the range of maxima intensity values in each spectra band is bigger indicating differences between landraces in HT-treated plants not observed in control ones. This is also corroborated by the increased dispersion of HT sample protein values as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>. In fact, associated with the global increase in protein content induced by HT treatment, a higher range of protein content values was obtained after HT (15%) in comparison to control samples (9%). Even more important was the increase in protein observed in HT-treated plants that corroborate the relevance of identifying variable wheat genotypes more adapted to global warming, particularly concerning the major determinant of grain quality&#x02014;protein content (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Asseng et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, the comparison of protein content range in grains from plants submitted to heatwave like the treatment here observed in landraces (10.2&#x02013;25.4%) and reported in commercial genotypes (10.1&#x02013;17.6%, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Tom&#x000e1;s et al., 2020a</xref>). This diversity, together with the higher average protein content observed in landraces after HT treatment, supports the relevance of old traditional genotypes as a source of useful variability breeding focused in wheat nutrimental quality.</p><p>Altogether, the four landraces studied presented clear distinct pathways in HT response testifying once again the diversity enclosed in the old varieties studied. Gr&#x000e9;cia and Ruivo are both affected in vegetative growth and yield, with a reduction, although not always significant, in almost all the parameters. The other two landraces&#x02014;Magueija and Ardito&#x02014;showed opposite behaviors, as unraveled by the PCA of all yield parameters and protein quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Magueija plants seem to be less affected by heatwave-like treatment in terms of yield as after HT, 10-grain weight is higher even when compared with commercial varieties. However, no significant increase in grain protein content was induced by HT, suggesting that the increase in tillers&#x02019; number may reduce the allocation of resources to the grain filling per spike, ultimately resulting in worst flour quality (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). On the other hand, Ardito not only revealed the higher protein content in the control condition but also disclosed a significant increase in this grain quality parameter after HT treatment. Moreover, Ardito is the earlier landrace (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), with a number of days from germinations to flowering similar to the ones previously observed (not published) in commercial varieties studied in <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Tom&#x000e1;s et al. (2020a)</xref>, which may be determinant to avoid heat stress conditions.</p><p>The overall diverse outcomes induced by a heatwave-like treatment in distinct landraces contrasts with the reduced diversity observed in wheat commercial varieties submitted to a similar treatment previously reported (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Tom&#x000e1;s et al., 2020a</xref>,b). This superior variability, unraveled under extreme thermal conditions, highlights the potential usefulness of the biodiversity enclosed in old traditional wheat genotypes facing climate changes already sensed. Moreover, the integrative assessment of this work outcomes suggests that both Magueija and Ardito genotypes should be further evaluated seeking for attractive genotypes for wheat breeding plans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="S6"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Material</xref>.
