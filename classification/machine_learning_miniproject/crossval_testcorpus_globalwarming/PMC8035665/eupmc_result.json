The point of analysis is the University of Buraimi, located in Al Buraimi Governate, in the Northwest of the Sultanate of Oman, near its border with United Arab Emirates (UAE). The data is in the form of a value per day, for every day in the year. The data analyzed span the period from January 3<sup>rd</sup>, 1981 (earliest day available) to December 31<sup>st</sup>, 2019 (latest end-of-year available). The statistical analysis methods include: simple linear regression, F-test: two-sample for variances, analysis of variance (ANOVA): single factor, and t-test: two-sample assuming equal variances (pooled). The results show that the mean of the local 2-meter air temperature is increasing at a rate of about 0.039 \u00b0C per year, starting from an estimated value of 27.4 \u00b0C in 1980. For the standard deviation of the 2-meter air temperature, and the mean and standard deviation of its range; although a linear regression analysis suggests a decline over time, the regression coefficient is not significant. On the other hand, the analysis of variance for the 9 years 1981, 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2019 suggests existence of statistical difference among them collectively, for the 2-meter air temperature and its range. In the second part of this work, NASA POWER data for the air temperature at 2 m above the ground, the atmospheric pressure, the relative humidity at 2 m above the ground, and the daily precipitation were compared with recorded sensor measurements at Manah meteorological station, located in Al Dakhiliyah Governate, in the Northeast of the Sultanate of Oman over all days of years 2011, 2012, 2015, and 2016. The statistical analysis and visual inspection suggest that NASA POWER data are reliable for the 2-meter air temperature, while showing about 2.1 kPa constant shift (underestimation) for the atmospheric pressure. The data show mild inaccuracy for the 2-meter relative humidity, but are largely unreliable for the precipitation, with significantly exaggerated values compared to real recordings.", "affiliation": "College of Engineering, University of Buraimi, P.O.
