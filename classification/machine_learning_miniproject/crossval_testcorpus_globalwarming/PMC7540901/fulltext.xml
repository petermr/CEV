The earliest such damage estimates were speculative mathematical representations, but some more recent studies provide empirical estimates of damages on economic growth that accumulate over time and result in larger damages than those estimated previously. These heightened damage estimates have been used to suggest that limiting global warming this century to 1.5 &#x000b0;C avoids tens of trillions of 2010 US$ in damage to gross world product relative to limiting global warming to 2.0 &#x000b0;C. However, in order to estimate the <italic>net</italic> effect on gross world product, mitigation costs associated with decarbonizing the world&#x02019;s energy systems must be subtracted from the benefits of avoided damages. Here, we follow previous work to parameterize the aforementioned heightened damage estimates into a schematic global climate-economy model (DICE) so that they can be weighed against mainstream estimates of mitigation costs in a unified framework. We investigate the net effect of mitigation on gross world product through finite time horizons under a spectrum of exogenously defined levels of mitigation stringency. We find that even under heightened damage estimates, the additional mitigation costs of limiting global warming to 1.5 &#x000b0;C (relative to 2.0 &#x000b0;C) are higher than the additional avoided damages this century under most parameter combinations considered. Specifically, using our central parameter values, limiting global warming to 1.5 &#x000b0;C results in a net loss of gross world product of roughly forty trillion US$ relative to 2 &#x000b0;C and achieving either 1.5 &#x000b0;C or 2.0 &#x000b0;C require a net sacrifice of gross world product, relative to a no-mitigation case, though 2100 with a 3%/year discount rate. However, the benefits of more stringent mitigation accumulate over time and our calculations indicate that stabilizing warming at 1.5 &#x000b0;C or 2.0 &#x000b0;C by 2100 would eventually confer net benefits of thousands of trillions of US$ in gross world product by 2300. The results emphasize the temporal asymmetry between the costs of mitigation and benefits of avoided damages from climate change and thus the long timeframe for which climate change mitigation investment pays off.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was unfunded.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="13"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="27"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>The Matlab code used for this analysis is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4002104">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4002104</ext-link>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>The Matlab code used for this analysis is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4002104">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4002104</ext-link>.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>1 Introduction</title><p>Human economic well-being is affected by the efficiency by which societies convert various inputs (e.g., natural resources, physical capital, human capital, and labor) into goods and services that raise the standard of living of those who consume them. The availability of energy is fundamental to this process, and over the past several centuries humanity has relied heavily on the combustion of fossil fuels to provide this energy. However, the carbon dioxide emitted as a byproduct of fossil fuel combustion alters global biogeochemistry and climate.</p><p>The combustion of all available fossil fuels would likely be sufficient to raise global temperatures by more than ~10 &#x000b0;C above preindustrial levels [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This could trigger a geologically unprecedented climate change that, among a myriad of other consequences, would entail an eventual sea-level rise of over 60 meters [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and risk a mass extinction [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] that would undoubtedly harm human economic well-being. Reducing all emissions to zero in the very near-term, however, would likely require significant societal disruption which could also have substantial negative consequences for human economic well-being. Given the undesirability of these two extreme cases, it would be rational for humanity to follow an intermediate path to decarbonization [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>However, the optimal path of decarbonization from a global macroeconomic output perspective (i.e., the emissions reduction rate that maximizes the present discounted value of gross world product), is unlikely to come about under laissez-faire conditions since the economic damages of fossil fuel combustion are external to the private transactions associated with energy acquisition [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. That is, the benefits of fossil fuel combustion are privatized while the costs are socialized both is space and in time. To correct for this market failure, governments have long pursued multilateral agreements to limit global greenhouse gas emissions. In 1992, the United Nations Framework Convention of Climate Change adopted the official objective of stabilizing global temperature at a level that would &#x0201c;avoid dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system&#x0201d;[<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The 2009 Copenhagen Accord defined this global temperature target to be 2 <bold>&#x000b0;C</bold> above preindustrial levels [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and the 2015 Paris Accord enshrined this goal in an internationally legally binding document. The Paris Accord also strengthened the language such that the goal was to remain &#x0201c;well below&#x0201d; 2 <bold>&#x000b0;C</bold> and it articulated ambitions for limiting global temperature to 1.5 <bold>&#x000b0;C</bold> [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239520.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, current national commitments under the Paris Accord are likely to result in global warming closer to 3 <bold>&#x000b0;C</bold> above preindustrial levels by 2100 [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The most prominent tools used to evaluate the economic implications of various global temperature targets are Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs). There are a wide variety of such IAMs that vary in geographical and sectoral resolution [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], but some of the simplest and most often-used are FUND [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], PAGE [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and the Dynamic Integrated Climate Economy model (DICE) [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239520.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These models weigh the benefits of avoided economic damages from climate change against the costs of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and are often employed to calculate the global greenhouse gas emissions reduction pathway that maximizes the present discounted value of global social welfare. However, in most configurations, these IAMs produce optimal greenhouse gas emissions pathways that result in temperature stabilization levels above the Paris Accord&#x02019;s articulated targets of 1.5 &#x000b0;C or 2 &#x000b0;C [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. That is, these IAMs typically calculate that stabilizing temperatures at or below 2 &#x000b0;C imposes a global mitigation cost on welfare that is larger than the benefits incurred from avoided damages.</p><p>However, the optimal mitigation pathways calculated by IAMs may be reconciled with Paris Accord temperature targets if IAMs either substantially overestimate the cost of mitigation or underestimate the economic damages associated with climate change. Mitigation costs may be overestimated if, for example, induced technological change from climate policy is underestimated or the rates of cost reductions from learning-by-doing are underestimated [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. On the economic damages side, a growing body of research has challenged the previous widely-used climate change damage estimates included in these IAMs on the grounds that they neglect important impacts [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239520.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], are insufficient in their geographic coverage [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], are insufficient in their extrapolation to high levels of warming [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], do not account for synergistic effects [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], do not account for environmental tipping points [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], do not account for non-substitutability between market and non-market environmental goods [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239520.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239520.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and do not account for the impacts on economic growth imposed through influences on the factors of production [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239520.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>The representation of economic climate damages in IAMs might be improved by more rigorous grounding in observed relationships between climate conditions and economic output. Indeed, recent research has emphasized the historical/empirical estimation of the economic effects of climate change [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239520.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In particular, the results of several studies [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] suggest substantial effects of temperature change on economic growth. Unlike impacts on the level of economic output in a given year, such impacts on economic growth accumulate over time and can result in substantially higher aggregate estimates of impact than those traditionally calculated in IAMs [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239520.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. These computed damages are large enough such that even small differences in global temperature stabilization targets result in large impacts on global gross domestic product (gross world product, GWP).</p><p>In particular, Burke at al. [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] found that limiting global warming to 1.5 &#x000b0;C relative to 2 &#x000b0;C would result in cumulative avoided damages of ~40 trillion 2010 US$ in present discounted value (PDV) of GWP through 2100 at a 3%/year discount rate (we round most GWP values in this paper to the nearest 10 trillion to emphasize the approximate nature of these calculations). As a point of reference, GWP for the single year of 2018 was ~80 trillion US$ [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The above ~40 trillion US$ figure is the primary impetus for the analyses conducted in this study. The ~40 trillion US$ number represents the benefit side of the ledger for global warming mitigation of a given level but our goal is to put this number in context by including estimates of the costs associated with remaining below given levels of global warming. Our study follows in the footsteps of several previous studies that incorporated damages to economic growth into DICE [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239520.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239520.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239520.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] but we seek to address the following specific questions.

If we were to attempt to implement near-term finite time horizons (e.g., through 2050 or 2100) in the traditional DICE framework, the model would find it optimal to not mitigate climate change at all since the benefits of mitigation would not be fully realizable until after the model&#x02019;s world has ended.</p><p>Finally, we are seeking a rough estimate of what might be the practical net effect of various levels of emissions reductions stringencies; we are not necessarily seeking the net effect of the absolute best-case scenario emissions reduction pathway calculated with perfect foresight (what traditional DICE calculates).</p><p>Given our goals and the complications mentioned above, we alter DICE such that it is not run in its traditional optimization mode. Instead, we feed DICE a spectrum of greenhouse gas (represented by CO<sub>2</sub> alone) emissions reduction control trajectories that vary in their stringency (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239520.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239520.g003">3</xref>).

This savings rate results from the default values of the parameters used in traditional DICE and it is close to historical observations which range from 23.4%-26.8% from 2000&#x02013;2018 [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>In our framework, each ensemble of DICE runs is driven by sixty different &#x003bc;(t) time series that all represent linear increases in CO<sub>2</sub> control rates and differ in the timestep (at five year increments) at which 125% control is reached&#x02013;allowing for net negative emissions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239520.g004">Fig 4</xref>).

Since our exogenously-defined &#x003bc;(t) timeseries are required to be linear, the &#x003bc;(t) that we define as &#x0201c;optimal&#x0201d; in this paper is optimal in the sense that it maximized GWP under the constraints of monotonic linear reductions in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Requiring the &#x003bc;(t) timeseries to be linear greatly reduces the degrees of freedom in our analysis and thus simplifies our study. Because of these changes, we are using equations in DICE to run forward-projections in the same way a typical climate model would be run rather than using the equations to inform the perspective of a benevolent social planner.

In our most stringent mitigation case, we allow CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to cross zero and become net negative by 2040 &#x02013;similar to the most ambitions decarbonization pathways envisioned in the SSPs [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239520.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239520.g008">Fig 8a</xref>, green shading).</p><p>Below, we adopt the convention of identifying (i.e., labeling) the stringency of mitigation with the level of global warming realized in 2100 (i.e., where Default-DICE and Burke-DICE trajectories cross the vertical dotted line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239520.g008">Fig 8b</xref>). Thus, the more stringent the mitigation, the lower the temperature in 2100.</p><sec id="sec011"><title>3.1 Costs and benefits of mitigation through time</title><p>In addition to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and global temperature, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239520.g008">Fig 8</xref> also shows economic outcomes under each level of mitigation stringency. As might be expected, the largest difference between Burke-DICE and Default-DICE is seen in the calculation of the economic cost of climate change in terms of the fraction of global GWP lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239520.g008">Fig 8d</xref>), with Burke-DICE damages resulting in much greater losses of GWP than Default-DICE damages. Under Burke-DICE damages, ~15% to ~30% of GWP is lost in 2100 (relative to a counterfactual of no climate change). By design, this is consistent with the range calculated in Burke at al. [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This is in stark contrast to the Default-DICE calculation which shows about one-half to three percent of GWP is lost in 2100 depending on the global temperature. Also, since the Burke-DICE damages are levied on factors of production (as opposed to GWP &#x0201c;levels&#x0201d; as is the case for Default-DICE), economic damages under Burke-DICE continue to accumulate even after global temperature crests and begins to decrease (note the monotonic increase in the fraction of GWP lost even under the most stringent mitigation efforts for Burke-DICE, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239520.g008">Fig 8d</xref>).</p><p>Mitigation costs as a fraction of GWP, which are the same for Default-DICE and Burke-DICE, are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239520.g008">Fig 8c</xref>. DICE&#x02019;s representation of mitigation cost is highly idealized but produces global results consistent with those calculated from disaggregated, process-based IAMs [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239520.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Achieving the most stringent temperature stabilization targets entails the highest cost primarily because carbon-free energy sources are expected to be more expensive in the near term. In particular, DICE calculates that the mitigation costs associated with limiting global temperatures to below 1.5 &#x000b0;C are associated with a reduction of nearly 10% of GWP per year in the 2040s for both Default-DICE and Burke-DICE (relative to the no-mitigation case; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239520.g008">Fig 8C</xref>).</p><p>In the DICE framework, economic growth is projected to be strong enough to outstrip combined climate change mitigation costs and damages in all our model runs: all trajectories have substantial increases in GWP through time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239520.g008">Fig 8e and 8f</xref>). Thus, in order to highlight the effect of various levels of mitigation effort, the shading in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239520.g009">Fig 9</xref> shows differences in per-capita GWP relative to the no-mitigation case.

The solid black curves separate positive from negative values and thus delineate the year at which the given level of mitigation effort results in higher per-capita gross world product than the no-mitigation case (which we refer to as the break-even year).</p><fig id="pone.0239520.g009" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0239520.g009</object-id><label>Fig 9</label><caption><title>Effect of the level of mitigation effort on per-capita gross world product through time for both default-DICE and Burke-DICE representations of damages from climate change.</title><p>Plots contour the difference in per-capita gross world product between the no-mitigation scenario and the mitigation scenario which results in the global warming above preindustrial levels labeled on the y-axes (in 2100).

Light blue horizontal lines identify the level of mitigation effort that maximizes the time-discounted (3%/year) per-capita gross world product through 2100 and through 2300. The effect of heightened damages (Burke-DICE, panel b) is to decrease the net loss from mitigation in the near term, increase the net gain in the long term and to move the break-even year backward in time.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0239520.g009"/></fig><p>Under both representations of damages, mitigation reduces per-capita GWP in the near-term but increases per-capita GWP in the long-term. The more stringent the level of mitigation (moving towards the bottom of the Figures), the more economic loss in the near term and the larger the economic gain in the long term (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239520.g009">Fig 9</xref>). Thus, all levels of mitigation considered in this framework eventually confer a net economic benefit with the magnitude of the long-term benefit increasing with the level of mitigation effort.</p><p>Since Burke-DICE damages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239520.g009">Fig 9b</xref>) are substantially larger than Default-DICE damages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239520.g009">Fig 9a</xref>), they produce a shorter payback period (the break-even year is sooner in Burke-DICE than in Default-DICE). This effect is particularly strong at the higher levels of mitigation effort. Under the Default-DICE damage representation, the mitigation effort necessary to limit global warming to below approximately 3 &#x000b0;C is associated with a payback period that extends into the 22<sup>nd</sup> century (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239520.g009">Fig 9a</xref>). Under Burke-DICE damages, on the other hand, net economic gains from any mitigation begin to be realized within the 21<sup>st</sup> century (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239520.g009">Fig 9b</xref>). For more ambitious 1.5 &#x000b0;C and 2 &#x000b0;C temperature targets, Default-DICE damages imply a 21<sup>st</sup> century entirely characterized, by GWP sacrifice in favor of future generations while Burke-DICE damages imply that net global mean benefits will begin to be realized by the 2070s to 2080s, within the lifetimes of many people alive today.</p><p>Although mitigation effort eventually results in net benefit in all cases, the total economic impact of a given level of mitigation is typically quantified with a present discounted value (PDV) metric under which future economic outcomes are time-discounted and accumulated. This practice is typically implemented under a framework that considers climate change mitigation to be an investment analogous to any generic financial investment. Under such a framework, it is not sufficient to justify a given mitigation effort on the grounds that it will eventually confer a net benefit. In addition, it should be demonstrated that the mitigation effort out-performs reasonable alternative investments (in e.g., education, healthcare, or the direct alleviation of poverty) and thus it is worth not only the absolute cost but also the opportunity-cost of foregone investment elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. This notion is expressed mathematically by discounting the net economic effect of the mitigation effort, typically at an annually compounding rate of several percent per year (the discount rate, r), emulating the prevailing market interest rate in alternative investments [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]:

Specifically, this result suggests that if we suppose that alternative investments in capital, education and technology would yield returns of &#x0003e;7%/year indefinitely, without any hindrance due to climate change, then these alternative investments would be preferable to climate mitigation, even under Burke-DICE damages. However, on a finite planet that utilizes labor, energy and natural capital for production, we cannot expect exponential economic growth indefinitely, particularly in the face of unmitigated climate change. In particular, it may be more appropriate to think of GWP as being on a logistic trajectory than an exponential one.

[<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] justify the 2.0 &#x000b0;C target on purely economic grounds. There are a number of relevant modeling and parameter differences between the present study and these two previous studies that could account for some differences in conclusions (c.f. the present study&#x02019;s Methods section with &#x0201c;Calculation of Damage Costs&#x0201d; in Appendix A2 of Ueckerdt et al. [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] and &#x0201c;Deriving a New Damage Cost Function for DICE&#x0201d; in the Methods section of Glanemann et al. [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]). However, our results are not necessarily inconsistent with either of these studies. A critical point of distinction is that in Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239520.g012">12b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239520.g013">13a</xref>, we are discussing outcomes integrated through the time horizon of 2100 while these studies consider the optimal warming level (in 2100) taking into account accrued benefits integrated well beyond the year 2100 (though still time-discounted).</p><p>Indeed, when we consider the longer time horizon of 2300 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239520.g012">12c, 12d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239520.g013">13b</xref>), the distributions of all three levels of mitigation effort (1.5 &#x000b0;C, 2.0 &#x000b0;C and 3.0 &#x000b0;C in 2100) become positive on average for both Default-DICE and Burke-DICE, meaning that under most parameter combinations, the 1.5 &#x000b0;C and 2.0 &#x000b0;C temperature targets confer net benefits relative to no-mitigation. In particular, The mean of the distribution for Burke-DICE associated with the 1.5 &#x000b0;C target is near 2,000 trillion US$ and has a long tail that surpasses 3,500 trillion US$, indicating that the consideration of this longer time horizon and heightened damages, drastically increases the calculated benefits of stringent mitigation. Under Burke-DICE and the 2300 time horizon, nearly every parameter combination tested results in the 1.5 &#x000b0;C target producing more accumulated (time-discounted) GWP than the 2.0 &#x000b0;C target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239520.g013">Fig 13b</xref>, red).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>4. Discussion and conclusions</title><p>The results of this study come with a number of important caveats. First, we use a highly-idealized schematic model of the coupled global climate-economic system (DICE). This simplicity allows us to make transparent calculations but prevents us from explicitly simulating features of the system that may turn out to be of great importance. This applies to all modules of the DICE model, but it is particularly relevant to the estimation of mitigation costs which we weigh against climate damages in our benefit-cost analyses. Although DICE&#x02019;s mitigation cost calculations produce global values consistent with those produced from processed-based IAMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239520.g007">Fig 7</xref>), they do not explicitly represent individual energy technologies, individual geographical regions, energy systems&#x02019; inertia, cost declines via learning-by-doing, induced technological change, etc.</p><p>Another key limitation is that we have not considered the impact of Paris Accord temperature targets on non-market environmental goods and/or natural capital. The present study has been framed in terms of gross world product so that our results would be comparable to similar calculations from the IPCC [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239520.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and Burke at al. [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, the Paris Accord temperature targets were devised with much more than just economic optimization in mind and thus even if a given level of mitigation effort turns out to be suboptimal from a gross world product standpoint, it could still be optimal in a more holistic framework that places a higher weight on e.g., intangible natural capital like biodiversity. Impacts that are expected to be exacerbated under 2 &#x000b0;C of global warming compared to 1.5 &#x000b0;C, but are difficult to monetize, include a larger reduction in the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], a greater amount of ocean acidification [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], increased probability of an ice-free arctic [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], increased frequency of category 4 and 5 tropical cyclones [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>], increased habitat loss for insects, vertebrates and plants [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>], and increased susceptibility for malaria transmission [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], among many others [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, even impacts that may be readily monetizable, like the economic effect of sea level rise, will not be captured by historical interannual temperature shocks and are thus not included in Burke at al. [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] damages estimates. On the other hand, the damage calculations of Burke at al. [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] do not anticipate future adaptation and it is controversial as to whether historical temperature variability is an appropriate analog for the economic damages to be expected from sustained climate change. Indeed, it has been suggested that the damages projected by Burke at al. [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] may be substantially overestimated [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239520.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239520.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] and thus the range between those estimates and the default DICE representation of damages may be able to serve as a rough proxy for the envelope of uncertainty in economic damages from climate change.</p><p>Another caveat is that our model not run in optimization mode so the impact of mitigation on gross world product is not at its absolute least-cost limit under conditions of perfect foresight. However, practically speaking, we cannot expect to implement a perfect-foresight, least-cost control rate on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions at the global level. Thus, selecting from the spectrum of linearly ramping control rates used here still represents an outcome that is optimistic in terms of maximizing gross world product since the selection would likely avoid many economic inefficiencies associated with real-world implementation of mitigation policy.</p><p>Finally, we conduct our analysis using a highly idealized model with a single production function at the global mean level. This means that all of our calculations only apply to the global aggregate and say nothing about the distribution of benefits and costs of mitigation over differing portions of the income distribution [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239520.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>], or over different geographical locations [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239520.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. In particular, since we conduct our analysis on gross world product and not on the utility of consumption, we do not discount the well-being of future generations (which are wealthier than the present generation in this framework) in the way that they would be in the traditional DICE framework.</p><p>The above caveats notwithstanding, our analysis (which is similar to previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239520.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239520.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239520.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]) is able to reveal some rough first-order insights. First, the incorporation of heightened damages from Burke at al. [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] shifts the year at which a given level of mitigation effort begins to provide net economic benefit from the 22<sup>nd</sup> century to well within the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Thus, under stringent mitigation effort, Default-DICE damages imply, on the global mean, a 21<sup>st</sup> century entirely characterized by gross world product sacrifice for future generations while Burke-DICE damages imply that net economic benefits will begin to be conferred by the 2070s or 2080s, within the lifetimes of many people alive today (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239520.g009">Fig 9</xref>).</p><p>There are large differences between the two representations of damages in terms of the level of mitigation that results in the maximum present discounted value of gross world product. Under the traditional representation of damages, the 1.5 &#x000b0;C and 2 &#x000b0;C targets maximize the present discounted value of gross world product only under the combination of long time horizons and low discount rates (beyond 2150, and under 1%/year, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239520.g011">Fig 11a</xref>). In contrast, under the heightened representation of damages, the 1.5 &#x000b0;C and 2 &#x000b0;C targets maximize the present discounted value of gross world product starting in the early 21<sup>st</sup> century with discount rates as high as ~3%/year (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239520.g011">Fig 11b</xref>).</p><p>With the above point in mind, we still choose to highlight calculations using a 3%/year discount rate (because this is the principal discount rate used in Burke at al. [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]) and a time horizon of 2100 (because this is the timeframe used in Burke at al. [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], in IPCC assessments [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239520.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], and in Shared Socioeconomic Pathway studies [<xref rid="pone.0239520.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]). Under these temporal parameters, we calculate that limiting global warming to 1.5 &#x000b0;C tends to result in a net loss in gross world product relative to both the 2 &#x000b0;C level of mitigation, as well as relative to the no-mitigation scenario, under both Default-DICE and Burke-DICE representations of damages (blue and green vertical lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239520.g012">Fig 12a and 12b</xref>). Under the Burke-DICE representation of damages, we calculate that achieving the 1.5 &#x000b0;C target results in a net loss of approximately 40 trillion US$ in gross world product relative to 2 &#x000b0;C (through 2100, 3%/year discount rate).

He does so by including an empirically derived damage function into the simple integrated assessment model DICE for a set of linear mitigation curves. With the new damage function (compared to the one used in "classical" DICE) the author finds the costs of climate change (measured in global GDP losses) to outweigh the mitigation costs sooner. Net costs in such a comparison, however, are shown to highly depend on the discount rate as well as the time frame considered.</p><p>Overall the manuscript underlines the importance of looking at the time scales of mitigation costs and climate damages when comparing the two. It is written in a clear language and well structured in principal. I have, however, some concerns with the methods and the manuscript.</p><p>The underlying idea here is to compare climate damages avoided to the necessary mitigation costs. In doing so separately, it is quite similar to the method in Uekerdt et al. [1], who also use Burke et al. 2018 on SSP projections to derive climate damages. They compare these to mitigation costs as per a process-based IAM (REMIND); whereas this manuscript establishes an ensemble of the latter. I very much wonder why [1] get lower optimal temperatures (though when minimizing lost welfare) compared to these results. The author should definitively discuss these differences. Another recent publication with a similar endeavor the author should relate to - at least in the discussions - is Glanemann et al. [2]. They also incorporate Burke et al. 2018 damages into DICE, while separating growth from level effects in the full optimizing mode of DICE. They find the 2&#x000b0;C target to be optimal, even lower temperature targets depending on the SSP.</p><p>This manuscript nevertheless adds to the literature by looking at some uncertainties in the mitigation cost curve, but the aforementioned differences to other parts of the literature should be discussed thoroughly.</p><p>Unfortunately, many important details of the methodology are missing, which makes it difficult to fully follow the conclusions. Ideally, the author would also provide the underlying source code used.</p><p>I was very astonished to see that the author does not seem to use DICE in its standard mode of optimization, but rather uses some of its equations. The most important control variable of DICE, actually, is the savings rate, not the mitigation control rate as stated here. That also the savings rate is derived exogenously, so there is no optimization at all, only became clear to me later throughout the paper. As this is a very important aspect of the methodology here, it should be stated clearly and early.</p><p>Overall, it is not clear which variables are exogenous and which are endogenous. Also, though some equations can be found in the respective DICE description papers, this manuscript would much benefit from describing its methodology full for the important variables used here.</p><p>This includes:</p><p>- How is the capital depreciation rate used in K(t)? K(t) is determined using the SSPs (eq. 7). Is that only to derive the savings rate? What are typical savings rates derived from the SSPs?</p><p>- How do beta and xi (eq. 8) evolve? Is that from the original DICE? How are they scaled later in the Monte Carlo simulations? Same factor for the whole time series?</p><p>- What are the values for the parameters used here, e.g. gamma in eq. 4, c or theta in eq. 8?</p><p>- When is Y(t) used and when GWP(t)? Is the former used as gross GWP and the latter as net GWP?</p><p>- For sake of completeness a summarizing equation for the values depicted in the figures (e.g. climate damages, damages avoided) would be very helpful.</p><p>- Is only SSP2 used throughout the manuscript after Figure 1?</p><p>The method description needs to be much more complete before a publication of this manuscript.</p><p>A main point in this manuscript is the ensemble of mitigation scenarios, i.e. time series of mu(t). I wonder how narrowing the assumption of linear mu(t) actually is (assuming a constant reduction rate, i.e. exponential mu(t) seem to be as or even more reasonable). All of these include negative emissions, but for a more complete picture other mu(t) with ambitious mitigation without negative emissions would be highly desirable. Omitting negative emissions in a mu(t) additionally prevents shifting avoided damages into the future and would thus contribute to a more complete picture when looking at the relevant time frames as done in this paper.</p><p>Especially for communication in Figure 4 the method would benefit from sampling the mu(t) to have equidistant temperatures in 2100 (as that is the main variable used in the subsequent analysis). Regardless of the sampling used, a full description of the parameters used for that must be given in the method description.</p><p>In lines 150-158 the authors states three primary advantages of the method used. I partially agree with the first two, though I think one should note that, since DICE is not used in its optimizing mode, the results of this paper are not easily transferable to "normal" DICE analyses. However, the author claims that the method "removes the philosophical complications associated with converting consumption to human well-being via a utility function" (3rd point). While this is always a problematic issue, it is not avoided here at all. Rather than focusing on well-being via a utility function, this study looks at net production (Y/GWP), which is implicitly assumed to be the relevant measure to be maximized for this cost-benefit analysis (or "to justify the [...] temperature targets" as stated in the abstract). In a revised article this needs to be made more explicit.</p><p>Additionally, maximizing Y/GWP in the optimization mode in DICE would essentially mean no consumption. One might thus ask, if sticking to gross production as per the SSP data with a fixed savings rate makes sense when, at the same time, comparing mitigation costs and avoided damages in terms of GWP; in most IAMs this would result in shifting consumption in time additionally avoiding climate damaging production.</p><p>On a minor note, I would very much appreciate a short discussion on the concept of the discount rate. Since the costs of climate change go sub-linear in time (Figure 4d), a sufficiently large discount rate (as an exponent for exponentially diminishing sum) will always outweigh them (Figure 7); regardless of the time horizon.</p><p>Overall, I believe, when already using an integrated assessment model, the question of cost-benefit would be much better tackled in the full optimizing mode. This would actually embrace the idea of normative assessment in inter-temporal optimization for which such a model is built. Deriving both cost curves independently as done here, totally neglects their interaction (perceived damages in the future).</p><p>Nevertheless, after a thorough revision, this publication could definitely contribute to the literature on climate change cost-benefit analyses.</p><p>Other comments/questions:</p><p>Abstract (lines 13/14)</p><p>- I doubt that's a reasonable interpretation of the "break-even year" as used in this manuscript. Here it is the year in which the mitigation costs of that year and those of the damages avoided (for that year!) are the same. This notion totally neglects that the avoided damages of a certain year - due to the inertia in the climate system - result from mitigation efforts before that year. Thus, this definition of "break-even year" is only useful in a technical sense.</p><p>Figure 1:</p><p>- Please use a legend instead of arrows</p><p>- Do you mean "GWP change" (as it is &#x0003c;0, which is meant to be losses)?</p><p>Figure 2:</p><p>- Are the values on both y-axes "per year" or "per 5 years"?</p><p>Figure 3:</p><p>- Which discount rate is used here?</p><p>- Please use a legend instead the arrow</p><p>- "loss" in x-axis label should be removed</p><p>Figure 4:</p><p>- Please use a legend instead of arrows</p><p>- Damages avoided would be an interesting variable</p><p>- Please mark y=0 in c &#x00026; d.

Nat Comm., 2020.</p><p>Reviewer #2: I would like to thank the author for a very interesting article on a very topical matter. The paper is extraordinarily well written and very easy to follow. Given the large literature on DICE modelling, I think the paper adds a number of interesting aspects, such as comparing DICE outcomes to the SSPs, yet before this paper is suitable to publish, I would, recommend a number of changes, clarifications and additional discussions to be taken up by the author.</p><p>Substantive Comments</p><p>1. It seems to me that the author is making a number of highly interesting additions to the DICE modelling framework. Yet overall, the fundamental question the author intends to answer (are the Paris Agreement goals economically beneficial, given new information on the damage relationship?) does not necessitate all these modifications to the DICE set-up. As DICE, in its original form, already equates costs and benefits and hence answers this question, I would be highly interested in the result of DICE with an amended damage relationship, but keeping the emission control rate endogenous, rather than as an exogenous variable derived from the RCPs (see Glanemann et al. 2020, Nature Comms).</p><p>2. In line 413, the author contrasts his results to Burke et al (2018), who find achieving 1.5&#x000b0;C over 2&#x000b0;C would result in $36tn economic benefits by 2100, while archiving this target would result in a loss of $9tn in GWP under the author&#x02019;s framework, which also includes mitigation costs. This would imply mitigation costs of $45tn by 2100 &#x02013; I would urge the author to discuss whether such a value for mitigation costs seems plausible.</p><p>3. The author stresses that the goal of his study is to represent the range of uncertainty between both DICE versions (Line 115). I would suggest representing this intention in the abstract as well, as uncertainty is not currently addressed in the abstract.</p><p>4. The author transparently states that in his framework &#x003bc;(t) must take a linear form. I would appreciate it, if the author would discuss the validity of this assumption based on empirical data (most process-based IAMs tend to suggest an inverse functional relationship being needed/most realistic) and some discussion whether his results would hold under an amended functional form.</p><p>5. It remains unclear to me whether the values of a, b, and c were tested for their sensitivity. It seems to me they were not included in the Monte Carlo analysis. As they are crucial values for the subsequent analysis, I would urge the author to discuss whether the choice of values (both individually as well as in relation to each other) would affect the estimation result. Further, I would appreciate a comparison of the study&#x02019;s values with the empirical evidence of temperature effects on capital depreciation as well as on total factor productivity.</p><p>Minor Comments</p><p>6. The author should detail the exact data source for Figure 3. I am unclear how the four boxes of for the mitigation costs of RCPs have been calculated and which IAM variable in process-based variables is used for this comparison (I assume the data was taken from the Appendix of reference 65, but more detail would be appreciated).</p><p>7. I recognise that the author is following Moore and Diaz in their functional form for equations 5 and 6, but I would appreciate an explanation/discussion on why temperature enters linearly in 5 and in a non-linear form in 6.</p><p>8. The goals the article is referring to are not &#x0201c;United Nations&#x0201d; goals. They are specific to certain international treaties and declarations, which have varying membership but are not universally accepted by all member states of the United Nations. In the spirit the author is referring to them, they should be referred to as &#x0201c;Paris Agreement&#x0201d; targets. Similarly, the Paris Agreement did not &#x0201c;affirm&#x0201d; the 2&#x000b0;C target (line 55), as it was enshrined in an internationally legally binding document for the first time then (Copenhagen Accord was not a treaty), while the language was strengthened in the PA to &#x0201c;well-below 2&#x000b0;C&#x0201d; rather than &#x0201c;below 2&#x000b0;C&#x0201d;.</p><p>9. For readers unfamiliar with the economics terminology, I would suggest explaining all variables used in equations when they first appear &#x02013; even if they are as simple as labour, capital and Utility (line 126, the definition is only provided two pages later).</p><p>10. In Figure 1, the author could consider presenting SSPs 1,3,4 and 5 in an appendix.</p><p>Where possible, Table 1 should feature the Greek letter for the variables in the Monte Carlo analysis as well.</p><p>11. In line 296, rather than referring to &#x0201c;comprehensive&#x0201d; IAMs, I would stick to the term used in line 258 &#x0201c;process-based&#x0201d; (alternatively: energy-system models or cost-effectiveness IAMs).</p><p>Reference 47 has different formatting to all other references.</p><p>12. The author could consider citing Lontzek, TS; Cai, Y; Judd, KL; et al. 2015 when discussing possible non-linear changes in the climate system and their effects on DICE modelling.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;I would like to thank the authors for implementing many of the suggested revisions from my first set of comments. Especially welcome is the revamped methodology section and especially the included schematic figures ensure clarity much better.</p><p>Given these changes, I only have a few remaining comments, which are either editorial or mainly concern the paper&#x02019;s framing. The framing of the paper is ultimately of course up to the authors, but I would encourage the authors to carefully consider my major comments, as I think the possible reception of this paper from certain audiences might deviate from the paper&#x02019;s actual conclusions.</p><p>This overall leads me to conclude that I think this is a highly interesting and well-presented paper which ultimately should be published, but I do believe that the authors should be wary of the reception of their results, which is why I suggest a few small changes to ensure adequate qualifiers are added, where they are necessary.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>I understand that the authors have chosen to report a particular specification of discount rate and time preference as their main result in order to compare their results to Burke et al&#x02019;s number of US$36tn. However, considering the major implications their claims could have regarding the 1.5&#x000b0;C and 2&#x000b0;C targets independent of Burke et al&#x02019;s result, I would urge the authors to qualify their 2100 main result with reference to the considerable sensitivity that is highlighted in their paper. The authors themselves argue that the sign of the 2100 result is sensitive to variation in their parameters and that across reasonable parameters the negative result would not hold for e.g. 90 or 95 per cent of the analysed parameters (the authors list that this is the case for 70% of the 2&#x000b0;C result and 80% of the runs for the 1.5&#x000b0;C result in their Burke-DICE) &#x02013; in contrast to the 2300 result where the sign of the estimated effects seems to be clear. I would suggest to the authors to qualify their main result for 2100 in the appropriate places (e.g. abstract, conclusion, etc.) with a reference to a certain sensitivity to the parameters chosen.</p><p>In a similar vein, I would argue the authors should at least mention that their calculations are not cost optimal pathways in the abstract and the conclusions.</p><p>I thank the authors for adding the reference that now clarifies that US$ 45tn is a reasonable estimate for the mitigation costs; at least according to the existing literature.</p><p>Perhaps the authors could add whether this is also the number that their model uses for the mitigation costs based on the SSPs. Currently, the authors simply compare their overall GWP loss to Burke et al&#x02019;s damage statement, which implies the US$45tn mitigation cost. In effect, I would be interested to see how close the authors parameterization of the damages gets to Burke et al&#x02019;s original number.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>I would appreciate if the authors could restate in one sentence or so how Burke et al 2018 have arrived at their US$36tn figure so as to make the comparison easier (around line 480).</p><p>It is not entirely clear which study the authors are basing their damage parameters from. In a number of places, they refer to Burke et al 2015 and in others to Burke et al 2018. I would guess that their reference to Burke et al 2015 is wrong e.g. in Fig 3 caption, line 237, etc.</p><p>In the legend for Figure 1, the authors forgot the parameter h</p><p>I thank the authors for making their replication code available. Before publication, however, they should ensure to add replication instructions to the GitHub repository.</p><p>Reference 87 seems to have a formatting issue regarding the names of the authors in the bibliography.</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#x000a0;I did not review the previous version of the paper. The authors worked hard to revise the paper, but more work is needed. The language is awkward, the authors mess up their welfare theory, and the rely on a wrong model (see below).</p><p>Furthermore, there is little new in here. The authors refer to a series of papers that do very similar things.</p><p>"Traditional DICE" Traditional? Please consult a dictionary.</p><p>"we find it simplifying" ugly language</p><p>"to eliminate the social welfare function [...] so that the specific values of the normative parameters are not latently affecting our GWP calculations" what is "latently affecting"? more importantly, you did not remove the normative parameters, you set the rate of risk aversion to zero. You may want to reread Bernoulli's work on this.</p><p>"It eliminates the latent influence of normative parameters" No, it does not. It just replaces one set of normative parameters with another. The proposed method is not at all new. In the literature, FUND and PAGE have been running in this mode for decades.</p><p>"pretext" see above remark about a dictionary</p><p>"suggest" is the right word -- there is little evidence that climate change affects the growth rate of output rather than its level -- I do not need to point you to the relevant papers, which are in your bibliography.</p><p>The Burke model is not credible. It is by now common knowledge that there econometrics are wrong. They claim to regress a stationary variable (the change in log per capita income) on a non-stationary one (temperature). In fact, the regress income growth on the cointegrating vector of temperature and year dummies. This works in-sample, although their parameters are biased and their standard errors meaningless. Out-of-sample, the model goes quickly off the rails.</p><p>**********</p><p>7.
