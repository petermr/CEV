The ultimate broadening of the concept of marketing: Marketing is any activity, message, emotion, or behavior by someone, firm, organization, government, community, or brand executed consciously or nonconsciously that may stimulate an observable or non-observable activity, emotion, attitude, belief, or thought by someone else, group, organization, firm or community. The broadening definition applies to the current interventions by national and state/provincial governments as well as healthcare facilities, medical science facilities, firms, and individuals to mitigate and eliminate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Framing interventions as experiments is helpful in improving the quality of their designs, implementing them successfully, and validly interpreting their effectiveness. In January and February 2020, a few nations were exemplars for accurately forecasting the coming disaster of COVID-19 as a cause of illness and death and in designing/implementing effective mitigating strategies: Denmark, Finland, Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Norway, and Vietnam. While the COVID-19 prevention intervention tests now being run for several promising vaccines are true experiments, the researchers analyzing the data from these interventions may need prompting to examine the efficacy of each vaccine tested by modeling demographic subgroups for the members in the treatment and placebo groups in the randomized control trials.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kg005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>Intervention</kwd><kwd>Experiment</kwd><kwd>Marketing</kwd><kwd>Ultimate broadening</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Preamble</title><p id="p0030">The U.S. has deadliest 24&#x000a0;h: WHO data shows that 2909 people died from coronavirus [Friday, May 1, 2020] as lockdown restrictions ease across America. At the time of writing this note, the confirmed deaths per day for the most recent week range from 2374 (April 27) to 2909 deaths Friday, May 1. Close to 68,000 American deaths have occurred since the start of COVID-19 in the U.S. in January 2020. Counting the 50 states and 3 major U.S. territories, new cases of COVID-19 continue to increase in 19, remaining the same in 19, and declining in 15. The new cases per day plateaued in early April and remains for weeks at a 2000 daily average including the big spike on May 1 to 2909. As of May 3, the total cases in the U.S. is 1.2 million, with 153 thousand case recoveries, and nearly 68,000 deaths. Globally, COVID-19 has 3.5 million confirmed cases, 1.1 million recovered cases, and 246 thousand deaths. Given the partial opening of the lockdown in early May by most U.S. states and the low &#x0201c;herd immunity&#x0201d; present in May in the U.S. (i.e., below 30%), the nation will likely remain near the top of the crest in the first wave through May&#x02014;resulting in 60,000 (&#x000b1;10,000) deaths in May&#x02014;possibly a wakeup call for designing and implementing new major interventions in the summer months. The recent forecasts of 70,000 (up to 100,000 on May 4) U.S. deaths by early August were surpassed on May 4. U.S deaths due to COVID-19 will surpass 100,000 by the end of May and 2 million by December 2022.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0035">This essay highlights the following points. Research in management, marketing, and evaluations research specifically, and the additional business sub-disciplines, behavioral economics, history, healthcare, travel/hospitality research, and social psychology as well, provide useful principles and tools of practical value in mitigating society disasters ranging from pandemics to mass shootings&#x02014;these useful principles and tools relevant to the tasks-at-hand are ignored by most but not all executives and by members of the general population of many (e.g., the United States) but not all nations (e.g., Denmark). Second, the &#x0201c;ultimate broadening of the concept of marketing&#x0201d; (<xref rid="b9020" ref-type="bibr">Woodside, Caldwell, &#x00026; Calhoun, 2020</xref>) justifies marketing and business research involvement in examining and offering practical steps for managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Third, examining designs, implementations, and outcomes of interventions in mitigating and eliminating the COVID-19 pandemic as experiments is insightful. Fourth, principles for improving the accuracy of forecasting COVID-19&#x02019;s impact are available but are being ignored by most officials&#x02014;this ignorance nurtures bad decisions and helps strengthen the continuation of COVID-19&#x02019;s first wave of high numbers of illnesses and deaths. Fifth, recognizing (and (in) effectively managing) pandemics, global warming, corruption, segregation, misogyny, income inequality, cigarettes, and guns as interventions helps to identify similarities and substantial interconnections (e.g., the powerful remnants of segregation policies and outcomes still in place nurture substantially greater numbers of COVID-19 deaths per capita of African Americans versus European Americans).</p><p id="p0040">Each section from two through five elaborate on one of these five points. Section six emphasizes limitations of this essay and concludes with a very short-list of dramatic short- and long-term steps for mitigating and eliminating the seven disasters appearing in the title.</p></sec><sec id="s0015"><label>3</label><title>Use of principles and tools to the task-at-hand but ignored pervasively</title><p id="p0045">Effective principles and verified useful thought-action steps developed in medicine on how to treat diseases developed after 1940 in medicine because the discipline began to use the findings from experiments to create such principles/protocols for treating patients (<xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Armstrong, 2010, p. 2</xref>). The development was gradual (many decades) but medical schools embraced the teaching of evidence-based medical principles (<xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Armstrong, 2010, p. 2</xref>). Economics, management, marketing, travel/hospitality, and the additional disciplines are far behind medicine but advances are starting to appear while medical research still needs weening from using bad science practices in testing the efficacy of new drugs including vaccines (see below).</p><p id="p0050">The following statement is factual and supports the resulting principle from evaluation research that is known well and widely ignored. Fact: symmetric theory construction and null hypothesis significance tests (NHTS) are detrimental to advancing accurate and useful knowledge (<xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Armstrong, 2010</xref>, <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">Hubbard, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">McCloskey, 2002</xref>, <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">Meehl, 1978</xref>, <xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">Wasserstein, 2016</xref>, <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">Wasserstein and Lazar, 2016</xref>, <xref rid="b0220" ref-type="bibr">Woodside, 2019</xref>, <xref rid="b0235" ref-type="bibr">Ziliak and McCloskey, 2008</xref>) and NHTS is detrimental to effective decision-making (<xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">Hauer, 2004</xref>, <xref rid="b0235" ref-type="bibr">Ziliak and McCloskey, 2008</xref>). Principle: avoid symmetric construction and using NHST; use asymmetric theory test and &#x0201c;somewhat precise outcome testing&#x0201d; (SPOT) (<xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">Woodside, 2017</xref>). Applying evidence and principles to the new drug, remdesivir, for mitigating (not preventing) COVID-19&#x02019;s harmful effects, is suggestive that the Food and Drug Administration&#x02019;s (FDA) recent emergency approval of the drug is unsound because the evidence includes only two completed studies using random control trials (RCTs)&#x02014;one published in a respected refereed journal (<xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) and one unpublished, and additional studies without control groups. Here is the main conclusions of the published study, &#x0201c;Remdesivir use was not associated with a [statistical significant] difference in time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio 1.23 [95% CI 0.87&#x02013;1.75]). Although not statistically significant, patients receiving remdesivir had a numerically faster time to clinical improvement than those receiving placebo among patients with symptom duration of 10&#x000a0;days or less (hazard ratio 1.52 [0.95&#x02013;2.43])&#x0201d; (<xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020, p. 1</xref>).</p><p id="p0055">Anthony Fauci (Fauci quotes in <xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">Wehrwein, 2020</xref>), Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and one of President Trump&#x02019;s medical advisors reported in late April, &#x0201c;This is opening the door to the fact that we now have the capability of treating&#x0201d; COVID-19, Fauci told reporters sitting on a couch in the Oval Office with President Trump looking on. &#x0201c;And I can guarantee you as more people, more companies, and more investigators get involved, it is going to get better and better. &#x02026; Fauci said the NIAID trial, called the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial, showed a statistically significant difference in the primary endpoint, time to recovery, between patients randomized to remdesivir and those in the placebo group. The time for recovery for the remdesivir group was 11&#x000a0;days compared with 15 for the patients in the placebo group, Fauci said in the Oval Office. &#x0201c;Although a 31% improvement doesn&#x02019;t seem like a knockout 100%, it is a very important proof of concept because what it has proven is that a drug can block this virus,&#x0201d; Fauci told reporters. &#x0201c;This is opening the door to the fact that we now have the capability of treating&#x0201d; COVID-19, Fauci told reporters while sitting on a couch in the Oval Office with President Trump looking on. &#x0201c;And I can guarantee you as more people, more companies, and more investigators get involved, it is going to get better and better. &#x02026; Fauci said the difference in deaths&#x02014;&#x0201c;8% in the remdesivir group compared with 11% in the placebo&#x02014;had not yet reached statistical significance.&#x0201d; (<xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">Wehrwein, 2020, p. 1</xref>). Based on the evidence of the detrimental value of statistical significance testing and the likely failure in both the published study by <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2020)</xref> and the unpublished preliminary report by <xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">Wehrwein (2020)</xref> to analyze their data thoroughly at the case-level and asymmetrically, the available findings are inadequate for FDA granting of remdesivir&#x02019;s emergency use. <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2020)</xref> published study does not include examining the asymmetric configuration case-level effects for remdesivir versus the placebo as treatment conditions with additional chronic conditions in the same models. The relevant literature is highly supportive that RCT&#x02019;s do not achieve randomness for true randomness and the measurement of treatment effects in case-based, not variable-based, models are necessary (e.g., <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">Schulz, Chalmers, &#x00026; Hayes, 1999</xref>). Because randomized control trials may include bias in assignments of participants, examination of alternative configurations of treatment and measured variable conditions is another reason for doing so&#x02014;reliance on low correlations among treatment and measured variables is insufficient because of the inherent biases in correlations and the fact that conditional analysis differs inherently from variable directional relationship analysis. Plainly stated, remdesivir dosages may be effective for patients who are members in one to five profiles of patients but not among patients in general. Note in the findings of the <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2020)</xref> experiment, remdesivir had negative effects among 66% of the patients in the treatment group versus 50% in the control group receiving the placebo. Since RCT rarely achieve randomization completely in actual practices, the Wang study is improvable by constructing case-level, four-corner, asymmetric complex-antecedent configuration models (<xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">Woodside, Nagy, &#x00026; Megehee, 2018</xref>) to build separate screens for cases to identify in detail:<list list-type="simple" id="l0010"><list-item id="o0030"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0060">Patients for whom remdesivir indicates health improvements</p></list-item><list-item id="o0035"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0065">Patients for whom remdesivir indicates adverse health effects</p></list-item><list-item id="o0040"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0070">Patients for whom the placebo indicates health improvements</p></list-item><list-item id="o0045"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0075">Patients for whom the placebo indicates adverse health effects.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="p0080">Researchers in medical RCTs are aware that a new treatment drug may be highly effective for some patients exhibiting certain configurations of conditions but may have adverse effects on other patients with the same illness but exhibiting other configurations of conditions&#x02014;but they frequently do not build and test formal case outcome models of the treatment condition with these additional conditions in the model&#x02014;constructing and testing such asymmetric models of treatment and chronic conditions are possible (e.g., <xref rid="b0220" ref-type="bibr">Woodside, 2019</xref>) in field true experiments and quasi-experiments (e.g., <xref rid="b0220" ref-type="bibr">Woodside, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">Woodside et al., 2018</xref>). Such testing predicts point or interval outcomes using Bayesian statistical tests and not variable directional relationships (VDRs) using symmetric significance tests (NHST).</p><p id="p0085">Testing available without a placebo treatment, without using an RCT experiment design, and use of patients with severe cases frequently provide very rosy findings. For example, The University of Chicago Medicine recruited 125 people with COVID-19 into Gilead&#x02019;s [the firm owning COVID-19] two Phase 3 clinical trials. Of those people, 113 had severe disease. All the patients have been treated with daily infusions of remdesivir. &#x0201c;The best news is that most of our patients have already been discharged, which is great. We&#x02019;ve only had two patients perish,&#x0201d; said Kathleen Mullane, the University of Chicago infectious disease specialist overseeing the remdesivir studies for the hospital. Such a study does not control for &#x0201c;statistical regression to the mean&#x0201d; (<xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">Campbell &#x00026; Stanley, 1963</xref>) source of invalidity&#x02014;the use of patients all having severe disease will indicate either improvement or death since scant room exists for both improvement and decline other than death. Such a test is invalid for demonstrating improvement.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>4</label><title>The ultimate broadening of the concept of marketing</title><p id="p0090">The ultimate broadening concept of marketing: &#x0201c;Marketing&#x0201d; is any activity, message, emotion, or behavior by someone, firm, organization, government, community, or brand executed consciously or nonconsciously that may stimulate an observable or non-observable activity, emotion, attitude, belief, or thought by someone else, group, organization, firm or community. While scholars may propose that marketing is planning explicitly to attempt to influence a customer, this view is an overly narrow perspective. The ultimately broadest view of the concept of marketing is that marketing need not be planned for marketing to occur. The &#x0201c;marketing concept&#x0201d; &#x02013; the philosophy that firms should analyze the needs of their customers and then make decisions to satisfy those needs, better than the competition &#x02013; is not necessary nor sufficient in the ultimately broadened concept of marketing. &#x0201c;Something said or done by someone may stimulate (i.e. spark) someone else to think, say, feel, and or do something&#x0201d; captures the essence of the ultimately broadened concept of marketing. This perspective is intended to be the flip-side of <xref rid="b9010" ref-type="bibr">Tucker&#x02019;s (1967, p. 134)</xref> assertion of two primary propositions of consumer behavior: P1. Someone goes through some process and acquires something with some effect. P2. Someone else uses something in some way with some effect.</p><p id="p0095">Famously, <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">Kotler and Levy (1969)</xref> described the need for &#x0201c;broadening the concept of marketing.&#x0201d; &#x0201c;When we come to the marketing function, it is also clear that every organization performs marketing-like activities whether or not they are recognized as such. The philosophy of broadening the concept of marketing beyond business contexts has garnered support as well as stiff resistance (<xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">Novatorov, 2016</xref>). <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">Levy (2003, p. 5)</xref> observed, &#x0201c;The broadening idea created a stir. It was criticized by some people as obvious, wrongheaded, and even as evil. One-piece (<xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">Laczniak &#x00026; Michie, 1979</xref>) in the <italic>Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science</italic> accused us of creating social disorder by distorting the definition of marketing.&#x0201d;</p><p id="p0100">Embracing the ultimate broadening of the concept of marketing is helpful for replacing stovepipe disciplinary with multidisciplinary perspectives about knowledge, tools, theory, and evidence. Adopting broadening perspectives may help to reduce the tendency to think narrowly and help to avert the criticism, &#x0201c;That&#x02019;s not a marketing or a business topic&#x0201d; suggesting that a given issue is not relevant to the discipline. The ultimate broadening concept of marketing supports the perspective that marketing actions occur in fighting to overcome pandemics, global warming, corruption, segregation, misogyny, income inequality, cigarettes, and guns.</p><p id="p0105">Applying the ultimate broadening concept to the available evidence across the seven disasters in this essay&#x02019;s title supports the conclusion that the seven vary systematically across nations globally with some exceptions. For example, Russia and the USA are high consistently in comparisons to Australia, Canada, Germany, Denmark, Finland, New Zealand, Switzerland, and the Republic of Korea, in meager responses to COVID-19 during January to March 15 in the U.S. and all months since December 2019 in Russia, failing to respond to global warming (in the U.S. since President Trump&#x02019;s 2016 election and before and after 2016 in Russia), supporting corruption (in the U.S. since President Trump&#x02019;s 2016 election), neglecting civil rights violations, nurturing misogyny, increasing income inequality, and supporting the widespread availability of assault rifles (U.S. not Russia for guns), and exceptions include ROK&#x02019;s high corruption among business and government leaders.</p><p id="p0110">Some nations do have mixed bag responses to the seven disasters. For example, Japan has highly restrictive gun laws in comparison to the U.S. Handguns are banned outright. &#x0201c;Only shotguns and air rifles are allowed. The law restricts the number of gun shops. In most of Japan's 40 or so prefectures there can be no more than three, and you can only buy fresh cartridges by returning the spent cartridges you bought on your last visit&#x0201d; (<xref rid="b9000" ref-type="bibr">Low, 2017</xref>). However, Japan&#x02019;s culture nurtures misogynistic practices. This finding supports the repeated contention of the Economist (<xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">Economist, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Economist, 2014</xref>) that Japan needs to introduce national policies that would reduce highly misogynistic practices; here is the title of one of the articles in The Economist (<xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Anonymous, 2014</xref>): Holding back half the nation; Japanese women and work. The Economist has been very vocal (&#x0201c;read my lips&#x0201d;) about the need for cultural change in Japan. In contrast, for nearly four decades now the United Nations, and specific countries such as Denmark, have passed legislation and policies to nurture &#x0201c;gender mainstreaming&#x0201d; that effectively shifts nations from high to low misogyny. Thus, while likely to be exceptionally difficult to accomplish (e.g., centuries (1619&#x02013;1865) of slavery in the USA preceded &#x0201c;Jim Crow&#x0201d; laws from the 1890s to 1965 supporting racial oppression, lynching, and segregation), different sets of ingredients within a cultural recipe are improvable with major nudges via national will and action. Regarding Japan&#x02019;s response to COVID-19, the nation deserves a low grade assessment:<disp-quote><p>On March 24, the government and the International Olympic Committee agreed to postpone the Summer Games. This paved the way for the government on April 7 to finally announce a one-month state of emergency from April 8 to May 6 for Tokyo and six other prefectures. And on April 14, this was expanded to the entire country, although the &#x0201c;lockdowns&#x0201d; are partial in nature and largely exhortatory, lacking the power of legal enforcement and penalties for infractions. Now the state of emergency is to be extended. (<xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">Fukushima, 2020</xref>)</p></disp-quote>

Similar to the &#x0201c;Spanish&#x0201d; (i.e., starting in Kansas, U.S.) flu (1918&#x02013;1920 pandemic), the COVID-19 pandemic is highly likely to include three waves over two years resulting in 1.5&#x02013;4 million deaths in the U.S.&#x02014;1.5&#x02013;2.0 million with an effective vaccine becoming widely available (if ever) midstream in the second wave in 2021. Without the development of an effective preventative vaccine, COVID-19 will release its grip when herd immunity of 70 percent occurs around December 2022. Consequently, the U.S. can decrease deaths by 0.5&#x02013;3 million during the second and third waves by creating and implementing the ROK policies in overcoming COVID-19 in the fall 2020. Given the continuing profound incompetence in the U.S. national government in planning interventions to the COVID-19 disaster (since receiving reports of the looming disaster in early January and into May), the U.S. is highly likely to experience at least 1 million deaths before September 2021 and a second million deaths before December 2020 without the effective vaccine becoming widely available before September 2021. Periods of shutdowns or complete lockdowns cannot include the several months necessary for effectively reducing deaths based on the felt need and demands to open the nation after seven weeks.<disp-quote><p>The head of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has called on other countries around the world to &#x0201c;apply the lessons learned in [South] Korea and elsewhere&#x0201d; in their own battles against the coronavirus. South Korea's foreign minister, Kang Kyung-wha, speaking to the BBC last week, said the key lessons from her country are that it developed testing for the virus even before it had a significant number of cases. &#x0201c;In mid-January, our health authorities quickly conferred with the research institutions here [to develop a test],&#x0201d; Kang said. &#x0201c;And then they shared that result with the pharmaceutical companies, who then produced the reagent [chemical] and the equipment needed for the testing.&#x0201d; So when members of a religious sect in Daegu started getting sick in February, South Korea was able to rapidly confirm that it was COVID-19. &#x0201c;Testing is central&#x0201d; to the outbreak response, said Kang, &#x0201c;Because that leads to early detection. It minimizes further spread.&#x0201d; And it allows health authorities to quickly isolate and treat those found with the virus. Hong Kong and Singapore have followed similar paths in responding to this outbreak. They've used testing aggressively to identify cases&#x02014;not only testing people who are so sick that they're hospitalized but also mild cases and even suspected cases. They've quarantined tens of thousands of people who may have been exposed to confirmed cases. The vast majority of the people ordered to quarantine at home are perfectly healthy and never do get sick, but the few who do develop symptoms can be quickly isolated further. Tedros of the WHO refers to this as cutting off the virus at the bud&#x02014;basically stopping the virus from spreading further and preventing community transmission. &#x02026; Their experiences with these past outbreaks may have made officials more aggressive in responding to COVID-19 and possibly made residents more willing to accept intrusive measures to contain the virus. South Korea has used data from surveillance cameras, cellphones and credit card transactions to map the social connections of suspected cases. Hong Kong issues detailed information each evening about every newly confirmed case. While Hong Kong doesn't give out the names of those infected, health officials release each person's age, gender, street address, medical symptoms &#x02014; and often the exact location of where the person works. This allows other residents to determine if they might have been in contact with the infected individual. (<xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">Beaubien, 2020</xref>)</p></disp-quote>

During 1918&#x02013;1920 and valid today for COVID-19, with no vaccine to protect against influenza infection and no antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial infections typically associated with influenza infections, control efforts worldwide were limited to non-pharmaceutical interventions such as isolation, quarantine, good personal hygiene, use of disinfectants, and limitations of public gatherings, which were applied unevenly. The following information from shutdown interventions during the 1918&#x02013;1920 flu is relevant today. In the U.S., the lowest deaths per 100,000 were all in the nine cities with the longest social distancing periods: Minneapolis (267 deaths per 100,000), Indianapolis (290), Milwaukee (359), Columbus, OH (312), St. Louis (358), Rochester (359), Chicago (373), Louisville (406), and Dayton (460) (<xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">Markel, Lipman, &#x00026; Alexander Navarro, 2017</xref>).

Applying <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">Armstrong and Green, 2018a</xref>, <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">Armstrong and Green, 2018b</xref> first (of a few) rules for accurate forecasting, be conservative, construct forecasts using knowledge-based methods, and apply the simplicity principle, constructing a rapid forecast of outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic is possible using data from the 1918&#x02013;1920 flu. The frequently stated deaths for the 1918&#x02013;1920 flu is 675,000 Americans. The U.S. population in 1919 was 104,514,000. Using the ratio of 675,000/104,514,000, 0.646% of Americans will die by the end of COVID-19 (i.e., 2,112,000 souls). Given the improvements in medicines in 2020 versus 1918, the potential arrival of an effective preventive vaccine in 2021, and the end of profound incompetency if Trump is defeated, and shift from 25% toward 70% herd immunity, the prediction might be lowered conservatively to 1.5 million.

However, given the lack of preparation, the absence of an effective vaccine well into 2021 and possibly longer, executive incompetency, the current estimated low herd immunity estimates (i.e., &#x02264;30%), the inability to shut-down a nation for 3&#x02013;10&#x000a0;months, and current reliance on short-term estimates of COVID-19s impact, the estimate of 2.1 million U.S. deaths may be overly conservative. Overly conservative forecasts of impact of COVID-19 may be a hallmark of organizations initially from an industry perspective.

The World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC 2003) estimated that up to three million people in the industry lost their jobs in the most severely affected jurisdictions of China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Vietnam and that the outbreak cost these four economies over $20 billion in lost GDP. Tourism arrivals also fell by 70% or more across the rest of Asia, even in countries that were largely or totally disease-free.
