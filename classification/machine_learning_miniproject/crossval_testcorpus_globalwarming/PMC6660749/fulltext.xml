Although a large body of research has investigated the influence of communication on public engagement with climate change, few studies have investigated the role of interpersonal discussion. Here we use panel data with 2 time points to investigate the role of climate conversations in shaping beliefs and feelings about global warming. We find evidence of reciprocal causality. That is, discussing global warming with friends and family leads people to learn influential facts, such as the scientific consensus that human-caused global warming is happening. In turn, stronger perceptions of scientific agreement increase beliefs that climate change is happening and human-caused, as well as worry about climate change. When assessing the reverse causal direction, we find that knowing the scientific consensus further leads to increases in global warming discussion. These findings suggest that climate conversations with friends and family enter people into a proclimate social feedback loop.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>climate change</kwd><kwd>discussion</kwd><kwd>scientific consensus</kwd><kwd>self-persuasion</kwd><kwd>climate change communication</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="gs1"><funding-source id="sp1">11th Hour Project</funding-source><award-id rid="sp1">N/A</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Anthony Leiserowitz</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs2"><funding-source id="sp2">Energy Foundation (EF)<named-content content-type="funder-id">100005710</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp2">N/A</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Anthony Leiserowitz</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs3"><funding-source id="sp3">Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment (Grantham Foundation)<named-content content-type="funder-id">100008118</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp3">N/A</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Anthony Leiserowitz</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs4"><funding-source id="sp4">V.K.

Most prior research on how to motivate action has focused on understanding individual differences, for example, considering the role of education, religion, and ideology in driving climate change belief polarization (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Other research has focused on how top-down communications, for example, from scientists, influence public beliefs (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Importantly, however, little research has focused on understanding how interpersonal conversations shape beliefs and worry about climate change. This is surprising, considering the importance of the messenger in communication (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), and the fact that friends and family are one of the most trusted sources of climate change information (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Although people seldom discuss climate change with friends and family (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), discussion with others in one&#x02019;s close social network can be an important route by which people may learn key facts about an issue, such as the scientific consensus on climate change. As such, it is important to investigate the influence of people&#x02019;s climate conversations with their own friends and family.</p><p>Moreover, while a rapidly growing body of research has examined the influence of messages on climate change public engagement, few studies have investigated the role of interpersonal discussion (but see ref. <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In this study, we use nationally representative panel data to examine the influence of discussion about climate change on public climate change beliefs over time.</p><p>One fact that influences people&#x02019;s climate beliefs is the degree to which people perceive a scientific consensus about human-caused climate change (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Do people learn about the scientific consensus on climate change through discussion with family and friends? If so, does this have downstream effects on beliefs and worry about climate change? Answers to these questions may suggest that encouraging people engaged with climate change to discuss it with their less-engaged friends and family members could be an effective strategy to increase public engagement through social network activation.</p><p>Next, we investigate the possibility of reciprocal causation. That is, are people who perceive higher scientific agreement more likely to discuss climate change with friends and family, which reinforces their own beliefs and worry about climate change?</p><sec id="s1"><title>Study Overview</title><p content-type="flushleft">A nationally representative probability sample of US adults (<italic>n</italic> = 1,263) was surveyed at 2 time points about 7 mo apart.

Likewise, the indirect effect of perceptions of scientific agreement via an increase in global warming discussion was significant for the belief that global warming is happening (<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> = 0.004, 95% CI [0.003, 0.004]), the belief that global warming is human-caused (<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> = 0.003, 95% CI [0.002, 0.004]), and worry (<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> = 0.007, 95% CI [0.001, 0.012]).

Here we find that discussion can generate a feedback loop where people who discuss global warming become more likely to learn influential facts such as the scientific consensus that humans are causing global warming, which encourages further discussion. Importantly, indirect effects of discussion were significantly stronger than those of the scientific consensus, suggesting that encouraging people to discuss global warming with their friends and family may be a productive way to initiate the social feedback loop, but that the actual content of the discussion itself (e.g., scientific agreement) plays a key role in changing relevant beliefs.</p><p>The role of global warming discussion among one&#x02019;s own social network may be especially important given the powerful influence of messengers on message effects (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). For example, when the message comes from close friends and family, people less engaged with the issue may be more receptive than when an identical message is communicated by someone not part of their close social network.</p><p>Moreover, the politicization of climate science is likely exacerbated by the increasing fragmentation of media consumption (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Discussion with others in one&#x02019;s close social network, on the other hand, appears to be an important route by which people learn key facts about an issue, such as the scientific consensus. Without discussing global warming, people may never learn important facts about climate change, or that close friends and family care about the issue. Our findings show that, through discussion, people can engage their friends and family in a positive feedback loop that encourages deeper engagement with the issue of climate change.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s5"><title>Participants.</title><p>In the first wave of data collection (fielded 27 February to 10 March 2015), a nationally representative probability sample of respondents was recruited through Growth from Knowledge&#x02019;s Knowledge Panel (<italic>n</italic> = 1,263).
