However, the rapidly developing drought events that are termed as &#x0201c;flash droughts&#x0201d; accompanied by extreme heat, low soil moisture and high evapotranspiration (ET), occurred frequently around the world, and caused devastating impacts on crop yields and water supply. Here, we investigate the long-term trend and variability of flash droughts over China. Flash droughts are most likely to occur over humid and semi-humid regions, such as southern and northeastern China. Flash drought averaged over China increased by 109% from 1979 to 2010, and the increase was mainly due to a long term warming of temperature (50%), followed by the contributions from decreasing soil moisture and increasing ET. There was a slight drop in temperature after 1997, but the increasing trend of flash droughts was tripled. Further results indicate that the decreasing temperature was compensated by the accelerated drying trends of soil moisture and enhanced ET, leading to an acceleration of flash droughts during the warming hiatus. The anthropogenic warming in the next few decades may exacerbate future flash drought conditions in China.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Drought is usually a creeping phenomenon that persists for several months or years, and affects the food and water security significantly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, and heatwave usually lasts for a few days with sustained high temperature and notable impacts on human mortality and environment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. The two types of extremes have quite different time scales, but now they have a higher concurrent probability in many regions across the world under global warming<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, where increasing heatwave exacerbates drought condition, and drought in turn creates a favorable condition for heatwave<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.

For example, a moderate drought condition combined with a heatwave initiated a flash drought event over the central United States in May and early June 2012<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, which was unexpected and brought a grand challenge for early warning due to limited prior external signals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, and led to widespread crop failure and billions of economic losses. Other flash drought events were reported in China<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> and Europe. However, to date, there are limited studies that detect and attribute the change of flash droughts specifically.</p><p>Similar to traditional droughts, a change in flash droughts is not only associated with the change in terrestrial hydrological cycle, but also influenced by the change in terrestrial energy cycle (and the related heatwaves) as well as the interaction between the land and atmosphere<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Under global warming, the risk of heatwave is increasing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, and the terrestrial hydrological cycle is also expected to be intensified with increasing water vapor feedback<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, leading to the changes in precipitation, soil moisture and ET, as well as characteristics of climate extremes (e.g., droughts). However, global mean temperature remained flat during the first decade of the twenty-first century<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. The potential causes may include internal climate variability, such as the La Ni&#x000f1;a-like decadal cooling prevailed over the tropical Pacific<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> and reduced radiative forcing due to the increased stratospheric aerosols concentrations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> together with the minimum solar activity around 2009<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. During the warming hiatus, the trend for global land ET declined as well, although it was mainly associated with limited moisture supply<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Land ET is a crucial variable that affects the forming and evolution of flash droughts because the increase in ET can amplify the soil moisture anomalies and intensify the drought condition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. The soil moisture is also an important index for the identification of flash droughts, but the change in soil moisture is unclear<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> due to the observation and model uncertainties. Given the slowdown of temperature and ET, and the uncertain change in soil moisture, it remains unclear what changes have occurred in the flash droughts and whether the hiatus is responsible for the changes.</p><p>In this study, we focus on flash droughts over China, which is one of the most sensitive areas to the climate change, suffering from warming and drying significantly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Surface air temperature measurements for the period of 1979&#x02013;2010 from over two thousand meteorological stations, and soil moisture and ET estimations from three global reanalysis products are used to investigate multidecadal changes in flash droughts over China and the underlying causes.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Frequency of occurrence for flash droughts</title><p>Here we use the pentad-mean conditions to capture the short duration of flash droughts during crop growing seasons when they mostly occur<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. For each meteorological station and each pentad, a flash drought is defined as the condition in which surface air temperature anomaly is larger than one standard deviation, ET anomaly is positive, and the soil moisture percentile is lower than 40%<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. The ensemble mean frequency of occurrence for flash droughts over the period of 1979&#x02013;2010 is spatially very variable across the country owing to the influence of climate, soil and vegetation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Flash droughts occur mostly in southern China with a mean frequency of 16&#x02013;24 events per decade, followed by the northeastern China. In contrast, there are fewer flash drought events over the arid (northwestern China), semiarid and semi-humid (northern China) regions where vegetation is relatively sparse. This is easily understandable because over humid and semi-humid regions (e.g., southern and northeastern China), ET is mostly limited by energy supply as moisture is usually sufficient (even under a moderate drought condition). Positive ET anomalies, therefore, tend to occur concurrently with high temperature, creating a perfect condition for flash droughts. But for the water limited regions (e.g., northern and northwestern China), ET is very sensitive to soil moisture variations and a moderate dry condition may result in a significant reduction in the ET (i.e. negative ET anomalies), reducing the probability of the occurrence of flash droughts according to the definition. Another reason for the spatial distribution is the vegetation distribution, where a densely vegetated region will pump more water from deep soil during drought, leading to an increase in ET and consequently the occurrence of flash droughts. Therefore, flash droughts in China are most likely to occur over humid and semi-humid regions with dense vegetation. Replacing soil moisture anomalies with precipitation anomalies in the above calculation, one finds similar spatial distribution of frequency changes but with higher amplitudes (see Methods for details). On average, the mean duration of flash drought events is about 1.2 pentads (6 days) and the mean duration for each station varies between one to two pentads (5&#x02013;10 days, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Trend and variability of flash droughts</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2a</xref> shows the number of flash drought events per year averaged over China during 1979&#x02013;2010. For the whole period, despite some differences among three reanalysis products, they all indicate an increasing trend over China. The flash drought events increased by 109% from 1979 to 2010 with a statistical significance of p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01 (see Methods for details). Similar trends (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) can also be found in the sub-regions, with the highest increasing trend over southern China, followed by northeastern China, and northern China the lowest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>).</p><p>During the period of 1979&#x02013;2010, the warming rate is 0.36&#x02009;&#x000b0;C per decade (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) over China, with a sharp increase in the 1990s and a stabilization in the 2000s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). In addition, there is a decreasing trend for soil moisture (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) and an increasing trend for ET (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), although less significant than the change in temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c&#x02013;d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S1</xref>). For three sub-regions, the trends of three component variables are similar to those for the entire China, but with less significance for the soil moisture and ET over northern and northeastern China (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S1</xref>).</p><p>A multiple linear regression is applied to quantify the contributions of temperature, soil moisture and ET to the trend in flash drought (see Methods for details), and the regression explains over 81% of the variability of the flash droughts across China and its sub-regions. For the entire continental China, the contribution of the surface air temperature variability to the flash drought variability is the biggest (50.1%), followed by soil moisture (29.6%) and ET (20.3%). For the southern China, the flash drought variability is also mainly contributed by surface air temperature (48.5%), followed by soil moisture (37.7%) and ET (13.8%). The contributions of surface air temperature to the flash droughts over northern and northeastern China are again dominant (64.6% and 53.3%), and the secondary contributors are the ET (22.7%) and soil moisture (40.7%) respectively.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Changes in the flash drought trend during the warming hiatus</title><p>From the analysis above, it is found that the surface air temperature variability accounts for most of the variability for the flash droughts across China and its sub-regions during the whole period of 1979&#x02013;2010 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Before the big El Ni&#x000f1;o event in 1997/98, there was a warming trend over China, with a rate of 0.20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C per decade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). It switched to an opposite cooling trend with a rate of &#x02212;0.05&#x02009;&#x000b0;C per decade since 1998 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>), indicating that there is a warming hiatus in China. However, the increase in flash droughts does not seem to cease. The increasing trend over China for the period of 1998&#x02013;2010 is 259% higher than for the period of 1979&#x02013;1997 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b&#x02013;c</xref>), and the difference in trends is statically significant (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.1).</p><p>In fact, the flash drought exhibits an accelerated increasing trend over most parts of China, especially in southern and northeastern China (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>), although there is a warming hiatus across continental China except for the southwest and the Yangtze River basin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). For the southern China, the significant increasing trend in flash drought (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) in the last decade is mainly associated with an accelerated warming, an increased drying trend in soil moisture, and an accelerated increasing trend in ET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figs 3</xref>c and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref>d&#x02013;e). But the increasing trend in temperature over southern China is not significant during 1998&#x02013;2010 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S2</xref>) due to a decrease-increase-decrease triple pattern for the trend changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). For the northern China, the changes in flash drought trend are mixed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>), resulting in a decelerated increasing trend on average which is mainly caused by a cooling trend and a wetter soil condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figs 3</xref>c and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref>c&#x02013;d). For the northeastern China, the trend in flash drought is accelerated, which is mainly associated with the significant decrease of soil moisture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,d</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Flash drought is a kind of agricultural drought in nature<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, with concurrent events of extreme heat, soil water deficit and high vegetation transpiration demand. They are most likely to occur over humid and semi-humid regions (e.g., southern and northeastern China). This study uniquely investigates the trend and variability of the flash droughts over China, and is targeted at attributing the changes of flash droughts within the context of the understanding of the terrestrial water cycle in a changing climate.</p><p>Our results show that there are increasing trends for flash droughts over different regions in China, which is mainly associated with the temperature increase. This is similar to previous studies over California, where the global warming can increase the chance of concurrent droughts and heatwaves<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. In fact, high temperature may substantially exacerbate the drought condition. For example, the 1977 drought in California was only a 50 year extreme event, while the 2014 drought that co-occurred with heatwave was a 200 year extreme event<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>.</p><p>In this study, the increasing trends of flash droughts do not decline after the big El Ni&#x000f1;o event in 1997/98. Although it is worthy of mentioning here that the trend statistics over 1998&#x02013;2010 may not be robust due to the relative short period, the analysis does suggest that there exists significant increasing trends (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.1) in flash droughts over China during the warming hiatus. The underlying mechanisms are attributed by investigating the changes in temperature, soil moisture and ET. We find that increasing flash droughts during the warming hiatus is mainly associated with the accelerated drying trend of soil moisture over humid and semi-humid regions, and the accelerated increasing trend of ET over low and middle latitude regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). The accelerated drying trend of soil moisture over southern China is mainly associated with an accelerated decreasing trend in precipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>) that might be caused by decadal climate variability and changes in anthropogenic aerosols<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. The accelerated increasing trend of ET over southern China seems to contradict with the drying trends both in precipitation and soil moisture, but it is actually coincident with previous findings that both the potential and actual ET exhibit increasing trends over southern China<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. This might be due to an increasing atmospheric demand under drought conditions, where the change in ET over humid regions is not necessarily correlated with the change in soil moisture but rather with available energy, and less precipitation usually means more solar radiation. In addition, a greening trend<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> with better vegetation conditions might also be responsible for the increasing ET.</p><p>The latest IPCC report suggests that global warming is going to continue well into the 21<sup>st</sup> century. The observed increasing flash droughts reported in this study could potentially be strengthened further in the next few decades with more severe impacts on the water availability, agriculture and ecosystem. As flash droughts occur mostly in humid and semi-humid regions where people are less aware and less prepared, their impacts on human society and livelihood are much more severe. Different from traditional drought events, this new phenomenon demands urgent research into its mechanisms, monitoring and early warning system development.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Observational datasets</title><p>We used the daily surface air temperature and precipitation observations from 2474 China Meteorological Administration (CMA) meteorological stations during the period of 1961&#x02013;2014. A quantile mapping method<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> that matches the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) from the station data and the Global Land Data Assimilation System version 2 (GLDAS-2)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> global gridded forcing data at a 0.25-degree resolution, was used to fill the missing surface air temperature station data. After this procedure, about 22 stations were excluded due to the scale mismatch over the coastal areas. Observed precipitation for the remained 2452 stations was also filled in the same manner. If the missing data remained after the quantile-mapping, an inverse distance weighting interpolation from the 0.25-degree gridded data was used to fill them.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Reanalysis datasets</title><p>We used the soil moisture and ET from three global reanalysis products: GLDAS-2 3-hourly products at a 0.25-degree resolution, ERA-Interim<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> 3-hourly products at a 0.25-degree resolution and NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> 6-hourly products at a 0.3125-degree resolution. GLADS-2 provides the estimations of soil moisture and ET from a continuous simulation with the NOAH land surface model forced by meteorological observations.

These datasets cover the base period from 1979 to 2010. First, we computed the daily mean of the variable of interest. Then, we matched the grid data to the corresponding or nearest stations. Soil moisture and ET were standardized for each reanalysis dataset to facilitate the ensemble, the comparison across regions and the trend analysis.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Sensitivity to the definition of flash drought</title><p>A sensitivity test of flash drought frequency to the thresholds of soil moisture and precipitation was presented in the supporting information. In the case of precipitation, the corresponding composite of soil moisture percentile was greater than 40% in most regions of China (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1d</xref>), which was too high to meet the requirement of a drought event. On the other hand, if the soil moisture percentile was used as the identification of flash droughts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>), the corresponding composite of precipitation also showed an excessively negative anomaly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1c</xref>). This is consistent with previous findings that precipitation anomaly is no longer needed if the soil moisture is used for the identification<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. We also conducted the sensitivity test by changing the soil depths and soil moisture percentile thresholds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2</xref>). We found that the difference in the magnitude of flash drought frequency by using different soil depths was smaller than that by using different percentile thresholds. If the threshold of 20% or 30% was used, the flash drought frequency over northern and northwestern China was too low to have a statistical meaning within a 32-year period. And the consideration of a 2-m soil would cover both surface and root-zone, which facilitated the analysis of the impact of flash drought on vegetation. Therefore, we used the 2-m soil depth with a 40% threshold for the flash drought analysis. In addition, we tested the sensitivity of flash drought frequency to the thresholds of the surface air temperature and ET (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S3</xref>). We found that if the thresholds of 1.5 or 2 standard deviations were used for temperature, or if 0.5 standard deviation was used for ET, the flash drought frequency over arid and semiarid regions was too low to have a statistical meaning for the whole period.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Trend estimates and statistical significance test</title><p>Trends were calculated as the Sen median slope<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, which was widely used in detecting monotonic trend in hydrometeorological time series<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>.
