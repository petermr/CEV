Coral reefs support more species per unit area than any other marine ecosystem, making them an important reservoir for biological diversity and complexity. About 15% of the world&#x02019;s population lives within 100&#x02009;km of coral reef ecosystems, with many people depending on coral reefs for their livelihood. The importance of coral reefs for tourism, fishing, building materials, coastal protection, and drug discovery cannot be underestimated.</p><p id="Par4">Corals live in close association with a variety of eukaryotic and prokaryotic micro-organisms, potentially providing additional adaptive capacity to the holobiont. The most studied and well-known endosymbiosis between corals and their dinoflagellate algae (family <italic>Symbiodiniaceae</italic>) has a profound contribution to coral reefs rapid ecological success over geological history<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Over the past 200 million years corals have had a crucial role in shaping tropical oceans, but yet they appear to be highly vulnerable to environmental stress in general, and specifically to anthropogenic factors including climate change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Over the past several decades, reefs throughout the world have been affected by local anthropogenic stressors and climate change&#x02014;as much as 75% of the world&#x02019;s coral reefs are threatened and as many as 95% may be in danger of being lost by mid-century<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. This can be attributed to mass bleaching events that are tied to global warming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, but local stressors associated with overharvesting and coastal development (urban and agricultural) are also major contributors to this global decline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Bleaching occurs when the coral host loses its symbiotic-partners, the dinoflagellate <italic>Symbiodinium</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The loss of these symbionts can have adverse effects on the health of corals and eventually lead to their death.</p><p id="Par5">Demystifying the fundamental mechanisms of symbiont presence or absence is important for future conservation efforts and especially for attempts of assisted evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Today enormous efforts are made involving transcriptomics studies to reveal the potential mechanism of coral adaptation to a variable environment and stressors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. At present there are only a few studies trying to unravel epigenetic mechanisms in cnidarians including DNA methylation in corals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>; and histone markers like in the brackish sea anemone Nematostella<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. However, still a major knowledge gap remains, especially in histone modifications, and chromatin dynamics, regarding the regulatory and epigenetic mechanisms controlling these cellular and molecular pathways in corals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, partially due to the fact that in corals DNA methylation levels correlate broadly and uniformly with expressed &#x02018;housekeeping&#x02019; genes, whereas genes responsible for inducible or cell-specific functions are weakly methylated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Eukaryotic DNA is wound around histone proteins in a complex called nucleosome. This complex is vastly regulated as histones are removed to expose regulatory sites, such as cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and promoters, to allow binding of transcription factors and other regulatory proteins. Identification of enriched motifs within these active CREs can, therefore, reveal genes associated with a transcriptional regulatory network<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Genome-wide mapping of transcription factors binding to chromatin is frequently done by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) based methods, such as ChIP-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Conversely, these techniques are expensive and require a significant amount of tissue and extensive processing of the sample. The Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) is a novel technology that favors the sequencing of accessible chromatin loci<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and holds promise to overcome these limitations. While ATAC-seq is a powerful and promising approach for epigenetic regulation research, it is relatively new and has primarily been applied within well-characterized model systems.</p><p id="Par7">In this study, we aim to elaborate an understanding of cnidarian gene expression and regulation by revealing the interplay between chromatin accessibility aligned with gene expression dynamics, and its relation to the symbiotic state of the animal under temperature elevation reflecting global warming. For this goal, we choose to work with the symbiotic sea anemones <italic>Aiptasia pallida</italic> (<italic>sensu Exaiptasia pallida</italic>). The relationship with <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> is facultative, making this a convenient laboratory surrogate for studying coral and other cnidarians symbiosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. We optimized an ATAC-seq protocol to detect accessible chromatin regions in the symbiotic and apo-symbiotic morph of Aiptasia gradually introduced to thermal stress. By integrating chromatin accessibility profiles with transcription profiles (RNA-seq) we revealed 1309 genomic sites that change their accessibility in response to thermal changes. Moreover, apo-symbiotic Aiptasia accessible sites were enriched with <italic>NFAT</italic>, <italic>ATF4</italic>, <italic>GATA3</italic>, <italic>SOX14</italic> and <italic>PAX3</italic> motifs and expressed genes related to immunological pathways. Symbiotic Aiptasia accessible sites were enriched with <italic>NKx3-1</italic>, <italic>HNF4A</italic>, <italic>IRF4</italic> motifs and expressed genes related to oxidative-stress pathways. This work opens a new avenue towards understanding thermal stress gene regulation with the association of gene activity and chromatin accessibility. The work presented here shows that chromatin structure may act as a mechanism for adaptive response in regulating gene expression in cnidarian symbioses under global warming.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Chromatin accessibility profiles of Aiptasia</title><p id="Par8">To sensitively measure high-resolution chromatin accessibility at different symbiotic states of Aiptasia in response to heat-stress, we used the Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq). We optimized the ATAC-seq protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> for Aiptasia by including a step of symbiotic algae removal and native nuclei isolation by mechanical homogenization before the transposition step (see methods). We generated and sequenced ATAC-seq libraries, as well as input control, to a median depth of 8 million unique, high-quality mapping reads per sample. The experimental design included a total of four groups, in which two were introduced to heat-stress and two to constant temperature conditions serving as the control, over a period of 28 days. This was done for both symbiotic (symbiosis with Breviolum (i.e., clade B)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>) and apo-symbiotic state. The two heat-stress groups were exposed to gradually rising temperatures (+0.5&#x02009;&#x000b0;C per day to a max temperature of 34&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) and sampled at four designated temperature steps (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;3 per time point) as shown in Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. The photosynthetic yield (<italic>Fv/Fm</italic>) was measured along with the experiment as an indicator of symbiosis state as presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Control groups that were held under constant temperature showed no significant change in photosynthetic yield, while the symbiotic Aiptasia groups that were introduced to stress showed a significant change (One-way ANOVA: P-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) in photosynthetic yield in response to the stress (symbiotic control <italic>Fv/Fm</italic> was at the rage of 0.6&#x02013;0.67 and treated symbiotic anemones <italic>Fv/Fm</italic> was 0.25 at the end of the experiment) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).

Morphological changes, mainly the body expansion of Aiptasia, were observed during the experiment between day 21 (34&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) and after 1 week at this temperature (day 28 of the experiment, temperature 34&#x02009;&#x000b0;C).

The ability to cluster samples by their stress stage also shows that chromatin accessibility is strikingly different between the two morphs during the response to heat stress (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). These differences between heat-stress stages are likely due to changes in accessibility within host cell populations in response to heat and symbiotic state.

Indeed, the libraries showed on average that Promoters-TSS (defined as 1500&#x02009;bp upstream to 400&#x02009;bp downstream from the first nucleotide of the gene) features were enriched by over 40%, as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>.

It has been shown that dynamic chromatin movements and interactions in the nucleus play a crucial role in gene regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. To illuminate the chromatin dynamic rearrangement in response to rising temperatures with relation to the presence or absence of the symbiotic algae in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>pallida</italic>, we undertook comprehensive analysis using ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data obtained from one-month of experiment. The experiment was designed to subject both apo-symbiotic Aiptasia and symbiotic Aiptasia to gradually rising temperature as shown in Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.

We could identify 36,999&#x02013;83,061 peaks with &#x02212;log(p-value) &#x0003e;5, enabling the prediction of transcription factors binding sites within the accessible genome and specifically identifying the sites that changed in response to rising water temperature. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, regulatory sites, such as promoters and proximal intergenic regions, etc., were more represented in our data sets relative to their portion within the genome. Comparison of data peaks between morphs highlighted stark differences throughout the experiment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c&#x02013;f</xref>), suggesting the different physiological and metabolic requirements and survival strategies used, depend on symbiont presence within the host tissue. In basal condition the two morphs invest their energy differently while apo-symbiotic Aiptasia maintains homeostasis, the symbiotic Aiptasia invest in symbiotic preservation (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>), this starting point farther affects the two morphs heat response profile. With that observation in mind, we have found sites that significantly change their accessibility in response to heat (P-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05); around 800 sites changed their accessibility throughout the experiment, with only 331 overlapping sites between morphs (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Those sites were clustered by patterns (5 clusters for apo-symbiotic morph and 4 clusters for symbiotic morph) and motif enrichment analysis revealed different motifs associated with each morph and clusters. The low overlapping rate between the morphs accessible sites means a different profile response to heat stress. Between the morphs, apo-symbiotic clusters 5 and 4 (in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) present the same pattern as symbiotic clusters 3 and 4 respectively (in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), although different sites and genes participate in those groups. That observation is a result of altered transcription factor networks activated in response to the changing temperature and the presence (or absence) of the symbiont. Many cnidarians engage in complex symbiotic associations, comprising the eukaryotic host, photosynthetic algae, and highly diverse microbial communities; together referred to as holobiont<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The two symbiotic morphs of Aiptasia construct different holobiont relationships where the major symbiont of the symbiotic Aiptasia is the dinoflagellate <italic>symbiodinium</italic> and the apo-symbiotic Aiptasia has its bacterial and viral flora. This forces the host to respond differently and can directly affect the individual tolerance potential. Several processes, including DNA methylation, changes in histone density and variants, including various histone modifications and chromatin accessibility, have been described as regulators of various developmental and defense responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In the apo-symbiotic morph, the <italic>NFAT</italic> motif was enriched within cluster IV sites. There is evidence that the <italic>NFAT</italic> signaling pathway participates in the regulation of cell survival in different tissues and cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Apo-symbiotic cluster V was enriched with <italic>ATF4</italic> motifs, this transcription factor is associated with homeostasis in response to ER stress, and showing higher levels when reaching 34&#x02009;&#x000b0;C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.

In the symbiotic morph, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is increased (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>) in both the host and the symbiont cells in response to elevated temperatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. This leads to the enrichment of motifs of <italic>NKx3-1</italic>, <italic>SMAD</italic>, <italic>HNF4A</italic> and <italic>IRF4</italic> transcription factors as detected by chromatin accessibility. These motifs are classified to act in response to oxidative stress in mammalian cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, as previously shown that <italic>SMAD</italic> protein family helps in improving mammalian cell response to oxidative stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.

Further analysis of enriched transcription factor motifs led to a review of their expression patterns. We identified a correlation between expression and accessibility of transcription factors found enriched in clusters. Moreover, we identified resemblance in their expression/accessibility to their relative cluster pattern showing a link between those TSs and the observed transcriptional heat-stress response.</p><p id="Par15">The canonical pathways enrichment analysis using RNA-seq further strengthened the differences in response to heat we observed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Among top canonical pathways, apo-symbiotic morphs were enriched with immunological response loci such as <italic>TGF-&#x003b2;</italic> Signaling, <italic>NF-kB</italic> Signaling, and p53 Signaling. In contrast, symbiotic sea anemones were more enriched with pathways related to oxidative stress showing gene upregulation including RAR activation, NRF2-mediated and other oxidative stress responses. We concluded that these changes are due to symbiont presence and, consequently, the elevation of ROS, while apo-symbiotic morphs responded to possible changes in microbial communities. Previously this phenomenon was observed before as a major cause leading to coral bleaching as reflected by the decline of <italic>Fv/Fm</italic> measurements of symbiotic Aiptasia (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Finally, stress state triggered by high temperature is causing different response pathways. This is due to different secondary stress that is stimulated within the host cell depending on its symbiotic state. Many studies have shown that heat triggers increase ROS production by symbiont cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, and for symbiotic Aiptasia morph the response to it is crucial for cell survival.

GO for biological processes and gene promoters found within treatment specific peaks were defined, and were subsequently analyzed for enriched terms using metascape.org52 and Causal variants in this study were identified through the use of Ingenuity&#x000ae; Variant Analysis&#x02122; software <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuity-variant-analysis">https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuity-variant-analysis</ext-link> from QIAGEN, Inc.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Reporting summary</title><p id="Par24">Further information on research design is available in the&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">Nature Research Reporting Summary</xref> linked to this article.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec15"><p>
