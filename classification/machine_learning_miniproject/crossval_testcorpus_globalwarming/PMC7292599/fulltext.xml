Health professionals need to send a message to those whose lives we have vowed to protect: all three threats result from forces of nature made dangerous by triumphs of human intelligence, and all three can be solved by human intelligence.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</p><p id="para20">Albert Einstein warned that &#x0201c;the unleashed power of the atom has changed everything save our modes of thinking and we thus drift toward unparalleled catastrophe&#x0201d;.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> The nuclear threat plus global warming led the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists to advance the Doomsday Clock to 100 seconds before midnight&#x02014;the closest ever&#x02014;just before the pandemic.</p><p id="para30">Although it may seem overwhelming to contemplate additional threats during COVID-19, we must address all three since they are the greatest dangers ahead. Their origins and solutions are remarkably similar.</p><p id="para40">COVID-19 is the most visible. Had the outbreak happened before air travel, the mutant virus would have remained in China and spread slowly, if at all. Today, we face a permanent threat of future pandemics&#x02014;genes will continue to mutate and planes will continue to fly.</p><p id="para50">Nuclear war is the least visible threat, as well hidden as the virus of a bat in a cave near Wuhan. It is, however, the most likely to have an immediate, devastating impact. In a city hit with a nuclear weapon, by intent or by accident, there would be no decisions about which patient to treat with the remaining ventilator.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</p><p id="para60">Global warming is the threat most certain to generate future harm, although human suffering will spread more slowly than with nuclear war or a pandemic.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref>
</p><p id="para70">The global response to COVID-19 is a source of hope. Scientists launched an inspiring counterattack on the coronavirus. Clinicians, often risking their own lives, rushed to bedsides.</p><p id="para80">The struggles against these threats teach valuable lessons. First, each threat must be recognised. Second, political leaders must respect truth and defer to expertise. Third, the threats are global and require global cooperation. Fourth, we all have to focus on our collective survival, and that includes care for the least privileged.</p><p id="para90">The world need not be the same after the pandemic. It can be better. A COVID-19-induced awakening can arrest our drift toward catastrophe. Health professionals, uniquely aware of the threats, have an obligation to enhance understanding of the requirements for survival in the 21st century.</p></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref10"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ghinai</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>McPherson</surname><given-names>TD</given-names></name><name><surname>Hunter</surname><given-names>JC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>First known person-to-person transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the USA</article-title><source>Lancet</source><volume>395</volume><year>2020</year><fpage>1137</fpage><lpage>1144</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">32178768</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref20"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ervin</surname><given-names>RR</given-names></name><name><surname>Glazier</surname><given-names>JB</given-names></name><name><surname>Aronow</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Human and ecologic effects in Massachusetts of an assumed thermonuclear attack on the United States</article-title><source>N Engl J Med</source><volume>266</volume><year>1962</year><fpage>1127</fpage><lpage>1137</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">13890707</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref30"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lown</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Chivian</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Muller</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Abrams</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The nuclear-arms race and the physician</article-title><source>N Engl J Med</source><volume>304</volume><year>1981</year><fpage>726</fpage><lpage>729</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7464867</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref40"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abrams</surname><given-names>HL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Inadvertent nuclear war</article-title><source>Lancet</source><volume>2</volume><year>1988</year><fpage>559</fpage><lpage>560</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">2900933</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref50"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Watts</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Amann</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Arnell</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The 2019 report of The Lancet Countdown on health and climate change: ensuring that the health of a child born today is not defined by a changing climate</article-title><source>Lancet</source><volume>394</volume><year>2019</year><fpage>1836</fpage><lpage>1878</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">31733928</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="other" id="sbref60"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>The New York Times Archives</collab></person-group><article-title>The Einstein letter that started it all; a message to President Roosevelt 25 years ago launched the atom bomb and the atomic age</article-title><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nytimes.com/1964/08/02/archives/the-einstein-letter-that-started-it-all-a-message-to-president.html" id="interrefs10">https://www.nytimes.com/1964/08/02/archives/the-einstein-letter-that-started-it-all-a-message-to-president.html</ext-link><year>Aug 2, 1964</year></element-citation></ref></ref-list><ack><p>JEM is a co-founder of International Physicians for Prevention of Nuclear War, the organisation awarded the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize.
