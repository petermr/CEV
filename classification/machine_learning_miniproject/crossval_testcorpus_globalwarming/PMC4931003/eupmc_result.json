We studied thermal biology of Iberolacerta cyreni in high mountains of central Spain. Our results suggest that I.\u00a0cyreni is a cold-adapted thermal specialist and an effective thermoregulator. Among ectotherms, thermal specialists are more threatened by global warming than generalists. Alpine lizards have no chance to disperse to new suitable habitats. In addition, physiological plasticity is unlikely to keep pace with the expected rates of environmental warming. Thus, lizards might rely on their behavior in order to deal with ongoing climate warming. Plasticity of thermoregulatory behavior has been proposed to buffer the rise of environmental temperatures. Therefore, we studied the change in body and environmental temperatures, as well as their relationships, for I.\u00a0cyreni between the 1980s and 2012. Air temperatures have increased more than 3.5\u00b0C and substrate temperatures have increased by 6\u00b0C in the habitat of I.\u00a0cyreni over the last 25\u00a0years. However, body temperatures of lizards have increased less than 2\u00b0C in the same period, and the linear relationship between body and environmental temperatures remains similar. These results show that alpine lizards are buffering the potential impact of the increase in their environmental temperatures, most probably by means of their behavior. Body temperatures of I.\u00a0cyreni are still cold enough to avoid any drop in fitness. Nonetheless, if warming continues, behavioral buffering might eventually become useless, as it would imply spending too much time in shelter, losing feeding, and mating opportunities. Eventually, if body temperature exceeds the thermal optimum in the near future, fitness would decrease abruptly.", "affiliation": "Department of Animal Biology University of Salamanca Campus Miguel de Unamuno 37007 Salamanca Spain.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic-eCollection", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Temperature", "Global warming", "Lizard", "Behavioral Thermoregulation", "Cold\u2010adapted", "Iberolacerta"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.2216"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4931003"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4931003?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "6", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2016-07-07", "dateOfCreation": "2016-07-08", "firstIndexDate": "2016-07-08", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-08", "dateOfRevision": "2020-09-28", "electronicPublicationDate": "2016-06-12", "firstPublicationDate": "2016-06-12"}, "htmllinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4931003", "abstract": "Alpine lizards living in restricted areas might be particularly sensitive to climate change.
