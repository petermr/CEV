This first CGRA application provides multi-discipline, multi-scale, and multi-model perspectives to elucidate major challenges for the agricultural sector caused by direct biophysical impacts of climate changes as well as ramifications of associated mitigation strategies. Agriculture in both target climate stabilizations is characterized by differential impacts across regions and farming systems, with tropical maize <italic>Zea mays</italic> experiencing the largest losses, while soy <italic>Glycine max</italic> mostly benefits. The result is upward pressure on prices and area expansion for maize and wheat <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>, while soy prices and area decline (results for rice <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> are mixed). An example global mitigation strategy encouraging bioenergy expansion is more disruptive to land use and crop prices than the climate change impacts alone, even in the +2.0&#x000b0;C scenario which has a larger climate signal and lower mitigation requirement than the +1.5&#x000b0;C scenario. Coordinated assessments reveal that direct biophysical and economic impacts can be substantially larger for regional farming systems than global production changes. Regional farmers can buffer negative effects or take advantage of new opportunities via mitigation incentives and farm management technologies. Primary uncertainties in the CGRA framework include the extent of CO<sub>2</sub> benefits for diverse agricultural systems in crop models, as simulations without CO<sub>2</sub> benefits show widespread production losses that raise prices and expand agricultural area.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Climate change</kwd><kwd>Agricultural system</kwd><kwd>Food prices</kwd><kwd>Mitigation</kwd><kwd>CO<sub>2</sub></kwd><kwd>Crop model</kwd><kwd>Climate stabilization</kwd><kwd>Climate impact</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><label>1.</label><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p id="P2">Signatures of climate change are already evident in observations of natural and human systems, and the continuing rise of world greenhouse gas emissions suggests that society will face substantially altered climate conditions in the future (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">IPCC 2013</xref>).

This multidisciplinary and multi-scale perspective is essential, given our increasingly complex and interconnected agricultural systems, wherein farm outputs are traded in local, regional, and global markets that set prices motivating farmer decisions and practices in agricultural systems around the world. Assessment of future climate challenges must also recognize shifts in agricultural technology, socioeconomic development, dietary demand, and international policies that will shape any future world.</p><p id="P4">The Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP; <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Rosenzweig et al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) was launched in 2010 to provide systematic approaches capable of modeling these shifts in future agricultural food systems. AgMIP links agricultural communities, scientific approaches, and models for climate, crops, livestock, economics, nutrition, and food security responses. AgMIP protocol-based studies of various crop and livestock species, spatial scales, and models provide a basis for integrated assessment, multi-sectoral analysis, and scenario application (<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">Ruane et al. 2017</xref>).

CGRA links across agricultural models, disciplines, and spatial scales, using common scenario assumptions and a harmonizing model output/input framework to elucidate interactions that may be overlooked in isolated studies (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Given the urgency within the UNFCCC community for scientific insights into the implications of +1.5&#x000b0; and +2.0&#x000b0;C global warming, here we present the results of a fast-track assessment of the AgMIP CGRA designed to capture key responses and messages. <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">Rosenzweig et al.

This involves defining the preindustrial period and time horizon of climate stabilizations, and then exploring projected impacts of the embedded shifts in regional climate patterns, seasonality, and extreme conditions that will affect agricultural systems.

In CMIP5, future projections took the form of transient simulations driven by representative concentration pathways (RCPs; <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Moss et al. 2010</xref>), providing outputs from more than 30 modeling groups, but no clear projection of a +1.5&#x000b0; or +2.0&#x000b0;C stabilized climate state.</p><p id="P9">The Half a degree Additional warming, Projections, Prognosis and Impacts project (HAPPI; <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Mitchell et al. 2017</xref>) took on the challenge of estimating these stabilized worlds, and thus HAPPI outputs form the primary climate projections for this study. HAPPI established climate drivers for the +1.5&#x000b0;C World by drawing from conditions at the end of the 21st century within RCP2.6 (e.g. greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations, land use, and sea surface temperature anomalies) and combined RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 for the +2.0&#x000b0;C World. HAPPI defines the pre-industrial period as 1860&#x02013;1880, a relatively stable climate period absent major volcanic eruptions at the beginning of the modern meteorological station record. GCMs participating in HAPPI then conducted initial condition ensembles to examine natural variability and extreme characteristics of the 2006&#x02013;2015 period (&#x02018;current climate&#x02019;), then drove ensemble simulations mimicking stabilized +1.5&#x000b0; and +2.0&#x000b0;C Worlds pegged to the 2106&#x02013;2115 period. As the current climate period (~2010) is already ~1&#x000b0;C above preindustrial conditions, the +1.5&#x000b0; and +2.0&#x000b0;C Worlds require an additional ~0.5 and 1&#x000b0;C of global warming (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Morice et al. 2012</xref>). Future world simulations maintain a degree of uncertainty around the desired global mean surface temperature increase, given differences in the transient climate responses of GCMs to imposed forcings (MIROC5, in particular, was noted as being warmer than expected). <xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">Ruane et al. (2018)</xref> further described how these uncertainties may affect agro-climatic scenarios, and also compared the HAPPI subset of GCMs against climate conditions simulated when the RCP transient simulations cross the +1.5&#x000b0; and +2.0&#x000b0;C thresholds. In general, largely similar global conditions are present in both CMIP transients and HAPPI stabilization scenarios, but HAPPI produces warmer conditions over the rice-growing areas of Asia, owing to its use of cleaner end-of-century RCP2.6 tropospheric aerosol concentrations, while most CMIP transients cross +1.5&#x000b0; and +2.0&#x000b0;C global warming earlier in the 21st century.</p><p id="P10">Climate scenarios for maize <italic>Zea mays</italic>, wheat <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>, rice <italic>Oryza sativa</italic>, and soy <italic>Glycine max</italic> seasons focus on months between planting and harvest (according to the AgMIP Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison protocols, GGCMI; <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Elliott et al. 2015</xref>). Wheat-growing areas match the primary spring or winter wheat-growing season according to GGCMI simulated yields, with climate scenarios capturing the final 90 d of winter wheat before harvest in order to avoid the dormant vernalization period following planting (as in <xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">Ruane et al. 2018</xref>). Climate changes (mean maximum and minimum temperatures, mean precipitation, the number of wet days, and the standard deviation of daily maximum and minimum temperatures) were calculated for each month from the HAPPI ensemble for each GCM (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). While HAPPI provides climate changes from a ~2010 current period climate, AgMIP&#x02019;s GGCMI and local crop modeling protocols utilize a 1980&#x02013;2009 &#x02018;recent observed climate&#x02019; as the baseline, necessitating a simplified pattern-scaling estimation of climate changes between these different baseline climates (based upon local changes per degree of global temperature change in the HAPPI +1.5&#x000b0;C World simulation; see <xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">Ruane et al. 2018</xref>). CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations recommended by HAPPI for the +1.5&#x000b0;C World (423 ppm) and +2.0&#x000b0;C World (487 ppm) are higher than many transient simulations at the same global temperature threshold, although the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in any climate stabilization depends on a climate model&#x02019;s climate sensitivity (<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">Ruane et al. 2018</xref>). Together with climate changes aggregated over the growing season, these provide the driving conditions for global crop model yield estimates, and monthly changes are imposed on local weather observations to create daily time series scenarios for local crop model simulation using the mean-and-variability change &#x02018;enhanced delta&#x02019; approach described by <xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">Ruane et al.

Global precipitation rises slightly as global temperatures increase, but this effect is small compared to regional shifts in mean precipitation that largely track an exacerbation of moisture convergence and divergence regions associated with global warming&#x02019;s enhancement of the hydrologic cycle. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> presents median rainfed maize season projections for the +1.5&#x000b0; and +2.0&#x000b0;C Worlds compared to the current (~2010) climate, showing a pace of robust warming that exceeds global mean temperature rise for nearly all maize-growing regions and additional warming at higher latitudes and over portions of the East Asian monsoon (due in part to assumed aerosol policies). Median warming does not exceed twice the range among GCMs in many mid-latitude regions until the +2.0&#x000b0;C scenario or beyond, while the signal more readily emerges above relatively consistent projections in the Tropics.

Maize production declines further in the +2.0&#x000b0;C World; however, production for wheat, rice, and soy increase compared to a future without climate change (owing largely to uncertain CO<sub>2</sub> effects on C3 crops).

Crop models drive substantial price and area uncertainty for all crops. Crop model uncertainty is largely comparable to uncertainties from the inclusion of CO<sub>2</sub> effects for C3 crops (wheat, rice, and soy), with LPJmL tending to have larger CO<sub>2</sub> effects than the other models. Maize (a C4 crop with lower responses to CO<sub>2</sub>) sees additional crop model uncertainty likely owing to a stronger thermal response within pDSSAT. Overall differences in price and area changes across the 4 cereal crops indicate a need to include direct simulation of more commodities for future market assessments.</p><p id="P34">Relative to the IMPACT model, in the FARM model production shocks lead to slightly smaller price changes, but larger area changes for these 4 primary cereal crops (see <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). This is likely due in part to IMPACT only directly simulating the agricultural sector, but including a wider number of competing crop types, while the FARM model simulates a wider variety of competing land uses and buffers prices through responses in other sectors. IMPACT and FARM also differ in assumptions on land expansion, agricultural productivity growth, demand, and the possibilities for substitution between commodities (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Nelson et al. 2014b</xref>); the latter of which likely explains why wheat prices are more comparable between economic models than the other commodities. Although raw prices and land use have large differences between SSP1 and SSP2, their proportional response to production shocks is relatively unaffected by SSP selection.</p><p id="P35">Key emergent messages are apparent in the projections, even as median differences in the full ensemble between the +1.5&#x000b0; and +2.0&#x000b0;C Worlds are on the same order as (and often smaller than) uncertainties in crop and economic models. When CO<sub>2</sub> effects are included, median increases in maize and wheat prices and area exist for both Worlds, as do decreases in soy price and area. The direction of change for rice prices and area shifts from increases in the +1.5&#x000b0;C World to decreases in the +2.0&#x000b0;C World.</p><p id="P36">Uncertainty from the inclusion of CO<sub>2</sub> benefits is particularly important given that simulations of the +2.0&#x000b0;C World without CO<sub>2</sub> benefits reverse all price and area decreases, resulting in clear pressure for higher prices and expanded cropping area for all commodities relative to a world without climate change. When CO<sub>2</sub> is included, the 2.0&#x000b0;C World has lower prices than the 1.5&#x000b0;C World for C3 crops and reduced areas for rice and soy (wheat goes up slightly due to substitution effects), but without CO<sub>2</sub> benefits, the +2.0&#x000b0;C World has higher prices and areas for all crops due to warming and rainfall changes. As such, the considerable uncertainty in CO<sub>2</sub> effects assuredly propagates into the global economic outlook, although the range between simulations with and without CO<sub>2</sub> effects is likely higher than the true CO<sub>2</sub> uncertainty.

If CO<sub>2</sub> effects are indeed overestimated in current crop models, this would indicate that the +1.5&#x000b0; and +2.0&#x000b0;C World projections are likely to reduce availability of convenient food substitutes, drive up crop prices, and heighten land resource competition.</p><p id="P37">The &#x02018;FARM Mitigation&#x02019; row of <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> compares the no-mitigation and mitigation simulation ensemble within the FARM economic model, shining a spotlight on the ways in which the implementation of a mitigation strategy can cause substantial disruption as the agricultural sector seeks to play a role in emissions reduction. The dynamic carbon price in the FARM mitigation scenario is oriented to emitters, which dramatically increases energy costs in farm production as well as land use competition from bioenergy crops (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>).

Biophysical impacts in case studies were driven by local climate scenarios differentiated from the global scenarios in that they (1) imposed HAPPI climate shifts upon local climate observations (supplied by the US Historical Climatology Network and the Pakistan Meteorological Department) rather than gridded climate data; and (2) adjusted daily climate series according to monthly shifts in mean conditions as well as changes in the number of rainy days and the distribution of daily maximum and minimum temperatures (<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">Ruane et al. 2015a</xref>).

Similar to the global signal, maize yields decline at all 3 locations, while soy yields mostly increase. Locally-calibrated DSSAT and global crop model projections overlap and agree on the sign of median yield changes for all but Camilla soy in the +1.5&#x000b0;C World (potentially due to multiple water management treatments in the DSSAT results). There is a notable increase in uncertainty for the GGCMs; however, by isolating the median changes from the 3 GGCMs, it is apparent that GGCM differences are driving this uncertainty (if GCMs were the cause, the GGCM median would cluster near the center of the distribution). As was apparent in the global production results (<xref rid="S5" ref-type="sec">Section 3</xref>), differences between simulations with and without CO<sub>2</sub> effects point to CO<sub>2</sub> responses as a major contributor to inter-GGCM spread for C3 crops (particularly in the +2.0&#x000b0;C World). LPJmL, in particular, shows reduced losses and elevated gains for all case study crops compared to the other models, corresponding with larger CO<sub>2</sub> responses. Median pDSSAT and local DSSAT results (which come from the same underlying process model) match very closely for the Ames site; however, differences at Camilla and Greeley likely stem from their use of different observational datasets and procedures for the configuration of cultivars and management. Local DSSAT application also provides additional information on peanuts and cotton at the Camilla site (these crops were not simulated by the GGCMs).</p></sec><sec id="S16"><label>5.3.</label><title>Regional impact assessment case studies for +1.5&#x000b0; and +2.0&#x000b0;C Worlds</title><p id="P42">Regional implications of the +1.5&#x000b0; and +2.0&#x000b0;C Worlds are driven by the balance of local yield changes and shifting market prices, as well as policy and development trends that may counteract or exacerbate impacts on farm returns. Urban populations and non-farmer rural households would not benefit from rising prices for farm output, but will experience the price impacts as well as disruptions in commodity supply chains. This may lead to situations where farmers benefit from higher market returns even as consumers struggle to cope with higher food prices, or vice versa.</p><p id="P43">In cotton&#x02013;wheat systems in Punjab, Pakistan (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>), irrigated cotton yields show strong sensitivity to temperature increases that overwhelms any positive CO<sub>2</sub> benefit, with median yield declines in both the +1.5&#x000b0; and +2.0&#x000b0;C Worlds (14 and 19% losses, respectively; <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8a</xref>). Wheat yields also decline, but at a lesser rate (5 and 6% losses, respectively). Farmers facing falling yields see some relief in wheat prices that rise ~20% in the 2050 IMPACT SSP1 no-mitigation simulation, and these are even higher than the global prices due to demand and trade networks within South Asia. Cotton price changes are positive (+5%) in the +1.5&#x000b0;C World but then turn negative (&#x02212;2%) in the +2.0&#x000b0;C World. This turn reflects higher yields in other cotton production regions, which respond strongly to higher CO<sub>2</sub> and are further from critical temperature thresholds that challenge Punjab cotton in the +2.0&#x000b0;C World (recall cotton projections for Camilla, Georgia; <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>).</p><p id="P44">Results from the TOA-MD model help us understand ramifications of global price changes and regional crop yield impacts on Punjabi cotton&#x02013;wheat systems (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8b</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">d</xref>). The percentage of vulnerable households (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8b</xref>) indicates the proportion of households that are at risk of losing income due to the conditions imposed by the +1.5&#x000b0; and +2.0&#x000b0;C scenarios. A median of 64% of households are vulnerable in the +1.5&#x000b0;C World, driven by yield declines in cotton (the critical cash crop) that outpace price increases and lead to a decrease in net farm returns (&#x02212;11%; <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8c</xref>). In the +2.0&#x000b0;C World, household vulnerability rises to 70% and net farm returns decline further (&#x02212;16%) as cotton yield declines further while cotton price impacts turn negative. The percentage of vulnerable households does not reach 100% as some farmers benefit from the price increase, but the climate impact scenarios raise poverty rates (per capita income less than US$1.25 d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) by a median of 14 and 24% in the +1.5&#x000b0; and +2.0&#x000b0;C Worlds, respectively. Regional economic outputs (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8b</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">d</xref>) do not benefit from the spatial and market aggregations in global economic assessments, resulting in substantial regional uncertainty from local climate projections manifested in crop yield projections in addition to smaller effects from the suite of global price projections. The Pakistani case study thus offers the perspective of a region facing acute impacts on a key cash crop, underscoring the need to consider regional impacts even as global impacts may appear more manageable.</p><p id="P45">The analysis of Pacific Northwest dryland wheat systems in the US conducted by <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Antle et al. (2018)</xref> provides an important additional perspective of policy makers weighing incentives for farmer adoption of mitigation options such as those that could help achieve +1.5&#x000b0; or +2.0&#x000b0; C Worlds. Their assessments using the TOA-MD model addressed 3 key factors facing farmers on a 2030 time horizon: (1) changes in crop prices and costs of production associated with low-emissions scenarios; (2) policy incentives and technology adoption for emissions reductions through soil carbon sequestration; and (3) policy incentives and technology adoption for production of biofuels in a camelina <italic>Camelina sativa</italic>/ wheat rotation. Due to the focus on adaptation of these systems in the near term, relatively small changes in crop productivity due to climate change and CO<sub>2</sub> fertilizer were found. A sensitivity analysis to crop prices, costs of production, carbon prices, and biofuel prices was also conducted to determine example policy incentives that would attract farmer participation. Results indicated that 40% of farmers would participate, given that policy incentives approximately doubled farm incomes when adopting low-greenhouse gas emitting systems (aided by somewhat higher crop prices). More aggressive policy incentives (carbon prices of $75 t<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of C; high biofuel crop subsidies) would increase adoption to 70% and triple farm incomes. These interventions would in turn reduce the net global warming potential of emissions of these systems by 20 to 35% (see <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Antle et al. 2018</xref> for full details). The Pacific Northwest case study thus demonstrates that mitigation policies can be quite beneficial to farmers if incentivized by policymakers, although the latter must find the resources to support these incentives.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S17"><label>6.</label><title>DISCUSSION</title><p id="P46">AgMIP&#x02019;s CGRAs of the agricultural implications of +1.5&#x000b0; and +2.0&#x000b0;C warming provide insights into future challenges and opportunities for mitigation and adaptation. This first CGRA application illustrates the potential of linked models, scenarios, and case studies to provide consistent and multi-perspective insight for stakeholders in the agricultural sector and beyond. Assessment of the +1.5&#x000b0; and +2.0 &#x000b0;C Worlds also identified key sources of uncertainty and opportunities to improve the multi-discipline, multi-scale, and multi-model analysis framework of the CGRA.</p><sec id="S18"><label>6.1.</label><title>Summary of findings</title><p id="P47">Agriculture in the +1.5&#x000b0; and +2.0&#x000b0;C Worlds is characterized by differential impacts across regions and farming systems. This finding of differential outcomes is also projected for other sectors at relatively low levels of global warming (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">O&#x02019;Neill et al. 2017b</xref>). Yields for C3 crops (wheat, rice, soy) are higher in the +2.0&#x000b0;C World than the +1.5&#x000b0;C World, while C4 maize yields decline further (particularly in the tropics). Temperature, precipitation, and yield changes can be acute for specific regional farming systems, but on aggregate, the detrimental effects of increasing temperatures are offset to an extent by the beneficial impacts of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (particularly for C3 crops) and direct effects are smaller than those projected for RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5 at the end of the century (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Rosenzweig et al. 2014</xref>). Without CO<sub>2</sub> effects, yields for all 4 cereals decline at an increasing rate with global warming between the +1.5&#x000b0; and +2.0&#x000b0;C Worlds, which is an important caveat given continued uncertainty in CO<sub>2</sub> response and its influence on all aspects of this CGRA assessment.</p><p id="P48">Projected production changes alter prices and increase land use and agricultural expansion pressures even as international trade and crop substitution effects buffer the deepest impacts. Global changes mask starker contrasts in outcomes at a regional scale, as yield changes often outpace price changes as was shown to negatively affect cotton-wheat systems in Pakistan. Yields on a cross-section of US sites show both positive and negative outcomes, but also highlight crop model uncertainty in field configuration and the extent of CO<sub>2</sub> benefit. A hypothetical +2.0&#x000b0;C World mitigation scenario simulated by the FARM model would be quite disruptive in the agricultural sector, as dramatic expansion of bioenergy land use comes at the expense of croplands and grasslands, thereby raising crop prices beyond the impacts of direct climate impacts alone (an effect that would be even larger to meet the +1.5&#x000b0;C global constraint). In contrast, analysis of wheat systems in the northwestern US provides an example where farmers gain substantially from climate policies and price increases that incentivize carbon sequestration and biofuel production.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><label>6.2.</label><title>Priorities for future development</title><p id="P49">The Paris Agreement challenged society to limit global climate changes to a level that would minimize damages and be close enough to current conditions to facilitate practical adaptations. These targeted climate stabilizations therefore feature climate changes that are quite small compared to the higher RCPs and end-of-century conditions examined in previous assessments, leaving direct impact uncertainties among models (climate, crop, and economics) that are comparable in many cases to the magnitude of overall projected changes and the difference between stabilization Worlds (recall <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4</xref> &#x00026; <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).</p><p id="P50">Field experiments of fundamental biophysical responses and global datasets of agricultural management continue to be bottlenecks holding back model development (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al. 2017</xref>, <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Porter et al. 2017</xref>). Improvement of the CO<sub>2</sub> response is particularly critical given that this uncertainty has the potential to shift the sign of global production changes with far-reaching repercussions. Global and regional economic impacts are likely sensitive to the time horizon of climate stabilization, which was set at 2050 here, but could be explored in different years given uncertainty in climate sensitivity and emissions policy (<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">Rosenzweig et al. 2018</xref>, <xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">Ruane et al. 2018</xref>). Future CGRA applications would also benefit from more direct coupling of models to examine feedback loops, the establishment of commodity-based modeling networks (e.g. <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Asseng et al. 2015</xref>) and regional communities of modelers (e.g. <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Kollas et al. 2015</xref>), and the configuration of additional regional integrated assessments linking climate, crops, economics, and stakeholders examining regional vulnerability and options for adaptation and mitigation (such as was used in Pakistan and the US Pacific Northwest).</p><p id="P51">The CGRA framework could also be used in collaboration with the broader integrated assessment modeling community to evaluate the food&#x02013;energy&#x02013;water nexus under specific future pathways defined by SSPs, RAPs, and policy trajectories (<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">Ruane et al. 2017</xref>). These could include the Paris Agreement&#x02019;s nationally determined commitments or policies oriented toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (<xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">UN 2015</xref>). CGRA evaluation of mitigation strategies on the global (IMPACT and FARM) and regional (Pacific Northwest incentives) levels demonstrate the importance of continued identification and evaluation of a broad portfolio of mitigation strategies (and the need to facilitate consistent multi-model mitigation assessments). These include mitigation oriented toward both production and consumption, for example the climate-smart intensification of current agricultural lands, alternative dietary pathways, land-use restrictions, and approaches for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and associated policy incentives. These mitigation options must also consider the perspective of farmers, agricultural stakeholders, and policymakers in countries where agriculture remains a major portion of gross domestic product and those regions with high land and water resource competition.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM1"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplement</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS1529641-supplement-Supplement.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d39e1230" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S20"><title>Acknowledgements.</title><p id="P52">We appreciate the efforts of Dann Mitchell, Myles Allen, Peter Uhe, Mamunur Rashid, and Carl-Friedrich Schleussner to process and make HAPPI data available for CGRA analyses.
