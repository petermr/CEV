The excessive amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive species can lead to the peroxidation of lipids, glycation/oxidation/nitration of proteins, inactivation of enzymes, DNA damage and other alterations in the cellular organelles
 
In recent years, food oxidation and food spoilage caused by microorganisms is one of the most important issues facing the food industry and consumers. Accompanied by growing consumer interest in natural food additives, the search for effective antioxidants and antibacterial agents from natural resources as an alternative to suppress food deterioration is now focused on edible plants, especially spices and herbs, due to their presenting fewer side effects than synthetic chemicals used in today’s foods

Plants with medicinal or aromatic properties that are used in pharmacy and/or perfumery are usually defined as medicinal and aromatic plants; however, medicinal, aromatic and cosmetic plants would be a better term as many medicinal and aromatic plants are also used in cosmetics [
 
Antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of aromatic plants have been widely explored and found to have health applications in prevention and reducing risk of diseases such as inflammation, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular and cancer [
 
It is a well-known fact that radiation is a powerful cytotoxic agent. Reactive oxygen species such as superoxide anion, singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radical, nitric oxide, hydrogen peroxide and peroxyl radicals are generated by ionizing radiation in biologic system through radiolysis of water and are accountable for cellular injury caused to DNA and proteins [
 
Thus, the detrimental effects of radiation-induced alterations in biologic systems via reactive oxygen species generation play a crucial role in maintenance of metabolic homeostasis in the body. Therefore, any disparity in homeostasis results in oxidative stress [
 
We made our sincere and careful efforts to include and cite most of available reports and studies pertaining to radioprotection by aromatic plants and plant products however, exclusions if any, are regretted.

Food-borne pathogenic bacteria have been considered as the main causes of food-borne infections in worldwide.

Nowadays, the development of antibiotic resistance both in animal and human zoonotic bacterial pathogens has been related to the administration of antimicrobial agents in food animal production as growth promoters and their extensive therapeutic use. The antimicrobial agents can be passed through the food chain and contribute to the emergence of resistant bacteria that can be transferred directly to humans after consumption.
 
Therefore, there is an urgent need for control the spread of multidrug-resistant pathogens to new antimicrobial agents as a strategy. Presently, extracts and essential oils of medicinal plants are used as a novel source of effective antimicrobial agents.

Mosquitoes transmit a variety of parasitic (e.g., malaria and lymphatic filariasis) and viral (e.g., dengue, Zika, and yellow fever) diseases that pose serious public health challenge worldwide. One of the key strategies for controlling these diseases involves the use of synthetic insecticides targeting both larval and adult stages of the primary vectors. Although this strategy has helped avert thousands of deaths related to mosquito-borne diseases, the rapid emergence of mosquito resistance to these chemicals and the ecological and public health risks posed by these chemicals has created an immediate need for alternative vector control products (
 
In many parts of the world, botanical insecticides were commonly used to control insects of agricultural and public health significance from ancient times (
 
Although several hundreds of essential oils are commercially available, a substantial number of them have not been examined for their biological activity against mosquitoes. In addition, most studies focus on biological activity of individual oils. However, a growing number of studies have shown that certain essential oils can interact synergistically against the target insect populations including mosquitoes (
