"This is usually caused by some genomic regions being amplified more than others (Ning et al.,  2014).",not_acknow
"Furthermore, analysis of single cell sequencing data always needs support from meta-omics data for additional analysis.",not_acknow
"In addition, the determination of metabolic products is also necessary for unraveling of environmental PAH biodegradation processes and also to describe microbial interactions effecting the biodegradation process (Vila et al.,  2015).",not_acknow
"Therefore, a combination of different approaches is necessary for a full understanding of the composition and activity of bacterial communities.",not_acknow
"Application of integrated approaches could: (1) deeply describe the components of a complex community, including existing organisms, functions, and their activities at a given time point (Zimmerman et al.,  2014); (2) identify key players, sometimes diverse, rare taxa instead of majority groups (Kleindienst et al.,  2016); (3) reveal more complicated microbial interactions by determining the connections of both cultured and currently uncultured microorganisms (Abraham,  2014); (4) predict functions of the whole community with the help of different bioinformatic tools which can improve prevention and remediation of potential perturbations (Ivshina et al.,  2015).",not_acknow

Analysis based on SIP is a typical strategy for bacterial community study that combines culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches.,not_acknow
"First, cultivation is necessary to obtain molecular markers (DNA, RNA, proteins, or PLFA) that are labeled with a stable isotopic element (e.g.,  13C,  15N, and  18O).",not_acknow
