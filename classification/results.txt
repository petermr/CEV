1: Introduction
0: The last decade has seen increased interest in the use of essential oils from plants in the food, human health, and the pharmaceutical industry [ 1].
1: Different parts of plants can synthesize essential oils with diverse pharmacological activities, ranging from the cytotoxic, through the antioxidant, antimicrobial, and antiparasitic, to the anti-inflammatory [ 1,  2].
2: Their antibacterial activity makes essential oils suitable alternatives to antibiotics [ 3].
3: Many antibiotics can be not effective as bactericidal agents due to drug-resistancy of bacteria that have developed from the widespread use of antibiotics.
4: Essential oils can be used as natural food preservatives against food spoilage and pathogenic bacteria [ 4].
5: They may be an alternative to currently used synthetic compounds, which may have toxic effects and may be carcinogenic [ 3,  4].
6: The antimicrobial activity of the essential oils is associated with different functional groups and the synergistic, antagonistic, or additive effects between them [ 4,  5].
7: Essential oils may also play an important role in scavenging free radicals which may lead to oxidative stress [ 1].
8: Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) may induce the inflammation [ 6].
9: The inflammation is connected with many neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and other nervous pathogenesis [ 7].
0: Rhaponticum carthamoides (Willd.)
1: Iljin (Asteraceae) has been used for centuries in traditional Siberian medicine in the case of overstrain and weakness after illness [ 8].
2: The plant has demonstrated several biological activities, including adaptogenic, antioxidant, anticancer, and antimicrobial effects [ 8 10].
3: The raw material of  R. carthamoides comprises roots and rhizomes of three- to four-year-old plants which are used in various dietary supplements or nutraceutical preparations.
4: The collection of raw material from natural habitat or cultivation is not effective because it requires the destruction of the whole plants [ 11].
5: An alternative may be the biotechnological approaches such as the hairy root cultures obtained by  Agrobacterium rhizogenes transformation.
6: Hairy root cultures are characterized by rapid increase of biomass in a short time (46 weeks) and genetic stability.
7: The level of secondary metabolites in these cultures may be comparable to or higher than in roots of plants growing naturally [ 12].
8: In our previous study we obtained hairy roots of  R. carthamoides and evaluated their phytochemical profile in methanol extract [ 11].
0: As no description currently exists of the chemical composition of  Rhaponticum carthamoides essential oil from hairy roots (HR), the aim of the present study was to determine this.
1: The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity of this essential oil in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) stimulated astrocytes and its antimicrobial potential were also examined.
2: As the comparative material for phytochemical and biological studies essential oil from the roots of soil-grown plants (SGR) was used.

1: Introduction
0: The International Standard Organization (ISO) defines the essential oils (EO) as volatile products extracted from plants by steam distillation, in most cases.
1: They are usually complex mixtures of volatile, lipophilic, liquid, and odoriferous substances and associated with various functions necessary for the survival of the plant in its ecosystem, playing a key role in the defense against microorganisms and predators and in attracting insects and other fertilizing agents.
2: In traditional medicine, essential oils have a long tradition of use [ 1,  2].
0: The Lamiaceae family has potential in obtaining EO and it plays and important role in various sectors of the economy, for example, the pharmaceutical industry, perfumery, cosmetics, and food.
1: Several biological functions are associated with species by popular medicine, used for the treatment of burns, headache, colic, fever, reports of antiflu activity, antiemetic, carminative, insecticide, repellent, antibacterial, and combat intestinal parasites [ 3 5].
0: The genus  Mentha, popularly known in Brazil as hortelas, hortela-pimenta, menta, menta-inglesa, hortela-apimentada, hortela das cozinhas and sandalo, includes 2530 species that are known mainly due to the characteristic and refreshing taste.

0: The literature logs its spasmolytic activities: antivomitive, carminative, stomachic and anthelmintic, topical antibacterial, antifungal, and antipruritic.
1: In the preliminary phytochemical analysis of the essential oil, there was the presence of the main constituents: the majority were menthol, menthone, and menthofuran compounds which were responsible for pleasant odor [ 8 11].
0: The Amazon region with its immense biodiversity offers a great potential for the discovery of new flavors and products.
1: However, there is great scarcity of chemical and biological activities information associated with plant species due to deficient support in research work in biotechnology.
2: The aim of this study is to evaluate the chemical composition and  in vitro antioxidant, cytotoxic, antimicrobial, and larvicidal activities of the essential oil of  Mentha piperita L. (Lamiaceae).
0: Background
0: The plants belonging to the basil genome or  Ocimum genus of the Lamiaceae family are aromatic ones [ 1] and are considered to be a rich source of essential oils-the metabolites, synthesized by plants for specific functions, using various secondary metabolic pathways.
1: Humans have learned to use these metabolites since antiquity for food preservation, flavoring, and as medicine.
2: The basil essential oils are usually extracted from the leaves and flowering tops of basil plants.
3: Through the centuries basil was cultivated for culinary and medicinal purposes in many countries, which created a great diversity of species within the  Ocimum genus: the genus  Ocimum comprises more than 150 species and is considered as one of the largest genera of the Lamiaceae family.
0: It is known, that different cultivars of basil have the genetic ability to generate and keep different sets of chemical compounds.
1: This ability leads to a great variety of chemotypes within the same basil species.
2: According to some investigations [ 2], the essential oils distilled from various basil cultivars can contain alcohols (linalool), oxides (1,8-cineole), phenols (eugenol, methyl eugenol, methyl isoeugenol, thymol), esters (methyl cinnamate), aldehydes (citral), and camphor.
3: The 1,8-cineole, methyl cinnamate, methyl chavicol, and linalool are constituents responsible for the distinct aroma of basil plants [ 3].
0: Lawrence [ 4] named four major chemotypes of basil: methyl chavicol-rich, linalool-rich, methyl eugenol-rich, and methyl cinnamate-rich.
1: Both methyl chavicol and methyl eugenol are phenylpropanoids produced by shikimic acid pathway and are reported to be toxic to insects and microbes.
2: Linalool is a terpenoid produced by mevalonic acid pathway and known to possess antioxidant and antimicrobial activity [ 5].
3: Methyl cinnamate is the methyl ester of cinnamic acid.
4: It is found naturally in many aromatic plants, including fruits like strawberry and is known to attract pollinators.
5: According to Marotti et al.
6: [ 6] the European basils are mostly of linalool and methyl chavicol types, whereas tropical basils have methyl cinnamate as their major constituent.
7: Basils of methyl eugenol chemotype could be found growing in North Africa, Eastern Europe, and parts of Asia [ 7].
0: Numerous papers have been published on the antimicrobial and antioxidant properties of basil essential oils and its constituents.
1: Koeduka et al.
2: [ 8] and Zabka et al.
3: [ 9] reported the antimicrobial activity of eugenol with analgesic properties for humans.
4: Liu et al.
5: [ 5] investigated the antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of linalool and geraniol.
6: While Sokovic et al.
7: [ 10] and Huang et al.
8: [ 11] investigated the usage of linalool, methyl chavicol, and thymol for skin protection against all sources of environmental skin aggressors and treatment of various dermatological disorders.
0: Since the chemical composition (chemotype) and biological activity of essential oils distilled from the plants belonging to the same species may vary significantly, depending on the variety of cultivars, environment, elevation and cultivation methods, it is interesting to study the essential oils obtained from the different kinds of basil grown in Armenia, in similar conditions, at a significant elevation (1600 m above sea level).
0: In the present study the comparative analysis of the chemical composition and biological activities of essential oils distilled from three varieties of basil,  O. basilicum var.
1: purpureum,  O. basilicum var.
2: thyrsiflora, and  O. x  citriodorum, was carried out .
3: The plants under investigation were grown in the same soil, at the same elevation, and under the same climatic conditions.
4: The first two cultivars were varieties of  O. basilicum specie s, or Sweet basil, and the third one, the Lemon basil ( O. x citriodorum) was a hybrid between  O. basilicum and O. americanum.
5: The purpose of this paper was also to study the biological activities of given oils and to evaluate their potential using in food industry, cosmetics and medicine.

2: Inflorescence is an ovoid, heterogamous yellowish capitulum, with an involucral bracts; ray flowers are female, pistillate and fertile, while the disk flowers are sterile, and functionally male [ 1 3].
3: In Morocco,  A.campestris L. known as Allal, is used as antidiabetic [ 4], to treat digestive, respiratory, metabolic, allergic problems [ 5,  6] and cutaneous problems [ 7].
4: This herb has many other ethnomedicinal uses like antihypertensive [ 8], emmenaguogue [ 9,  10], and well known for treatment of liver and kidney disorders [ 11 13] and as.
5: Previous pharmacological studies proved that  A. campestris L. possesses antioxidant [ 14 20], antibacterial, antifungal [ 20 25], insecticidal [ 26 28], antitumor [ 14,  29 31], antivenin [ 32,  33], hepatoprotective, nephroprotective [ 34 37] and antidiabetic [ 38,  39] effects.
6: Recently a clinical trial conducted on volunteers demonstrated that  A.campestris L. enhanced 33.3% to 50% decrease in arterial pressure among hypertensive smoker patients [ 40].
7: In another study, the administration of  A.campestris L. extract induced antihypertensive effect on envenomed hypertensive rats, and provoked 10% to 30% of hypertension drop, while the pretreatment with the herb extract prevented the rise of hypertension [ 32].
8: Nevertheless, no in-vitro study has been elaborated to evaluate the antihypertensive potential of this plant.
9: In the aim to highlight the importance of this plant in the cardiovascular therapy, this study was performed to analyze the essential oil of  A. campestris L. (AcEO) growing in oriental Morocco, to investigate its vasorelaxant and subsequent mechanism of action and to determine its antiplatelet and antioxidant effects.

0: In June 2013, the United Nations projected that the world population will reach 9.6 billion by 2050 from the current 7.4 billion [ 1].
1: The world population growth increases the food demand.
2: It is estimated that oil crops must increase by 133 million tonnes to reach 282 million tonnes in order to cover the demand.
3: Four oil crops (oil palm, soybean, rape, and sunflower) account for 83% of the world production [ 2].
4: The major oilseed production areas are in the temperate zones.
5: America and Europe together account for more than 60% of the world production of oil seeds, whereas a substantially smaller production (<5%) comes from tropical areas such as Africa, Malaysia, and Indonesia [ 3].
6: The most important tropical oil crops include coconut, oil palm, groundnut, and cotton.
7: However, there are many other traditional oil seeds in tropical Africa that are underexploited, as the nutritional and economic values are poorly known.
8: These oils come from numerous botanical families including the Anacardiaceae in West Africa.
9: The Anacardiaceae family comprises about 70 genera and 600 species including oil and protein rich species, for example,  Pistacia vera L.,  Sclerocarya birrea (A.

1: Introduction
0: Consumers demand high quality foods with minimal changes in nutritional properties.
1: A minimal amount of synthetic additives combined with a suitable packaging technology that retains or creates desirable food qualities or reduces undesirable changes in food due to microbial activity is therefore a goal of food manufacturers [ 1].
2: New processes must be designed to meet the required food product safety or shelf-life demands, and additional hurdles for microorganisms should be introduced.
3: World Health Organization (WHO) reports [ 2] in recent years estimate that 30% of people in industrialized countries suffer from a food-borne disease each year.
4: Reducing or eliminating food-borne pathogens via green consumerism concomitantly with low salt consumption to diminish the incidence of cardiovascular diseases is increasingly becoming a public health concern.
5: On the other hand, antimicrobial resistance affects all areas of health, as many medicinal procedures are related to antibiotics [ 3].
0: Therefore, new methods and additives should be found to prolong service life and to improve the safety of foods.
1: Recently, effective preventive measures and intelligent preservation methods have been put into place to reduce food spoilage, increase safety, and prolong food shelf-life.
2: One of these methods is bioactive packaging by the use of natural compounds with multifunctional properties both to achieve the protection of food and to improve the health of consumers.
3: The concern regarding safety issues of the synthetic antimicrobial agents has led to the use of essential oils (EOs), which represent eco-friendly alternatives to chemicals.
4: Essential oils (also called volatile oils) are oily liquids obtained from plant materials (flowers, buds, seeds, leaves, twigs, bark, herbs, wood, fruits, and roots).
5: Plant-derived essential oils are complex mixtures of natural volatile compounds resulting from the plant secondary metabolism and extracted from vegetable materials by expression (i.e., cold pressing), fermentation, enfleurage, or extraction, but the method of distillation with water or steam is the most commonly used for the commercial production of EOs.
6: Essential oils contain important classes of compounds such as monoterpenes (C 10 hydrocarbons based on 2 isoprene units), phenylpropanoides (C 6 aromatic compounds with C 3 side chains), sesquiterpenes (C 15 hydrocarbons based on 3 isoprene units), diterpenes (C 20), triterpenes (C 30) and their oxygenated derivatives, and phenolic compounds (such as thymol and carvacrol).
7: Due to their versatile content, essential oils constitute a rich source of biologically active compounds possessing antimicrobial, antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant, antiviral, antimycotic, antitoxigenic, antiparasitic, antibiotic, and antiseptic properties and insecticidal activities; therefore, they are useful in a wide range of applications [ 4, 5].
0: Each of the above-mentioned constituents contributes to beneficial or adverse effects; therefore, it is very important to know as much as possible about the composition and properties of EOs, with each study bringing new highlights on the advantages and disadvantages they offer.
0: There are many studies on the characterization of volatile compound composition and the antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of various selected groups of essential oils.
1: Bozin et al.
2: characterized Lamiaceae species and the antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of the oils of  Ocimum basilicum L.,  Origanum vulgare L., and  Thymus vulgaris L. [ 6], and the chemical constituents of four populations of  Piper aduncum L. from Distrito Federal, Brazil [ 7], were identified.
3: Many other essential oils have been characterized, namely, sweet lime ( Citrus limetta Risso) [ 8],  Chenopodium ambrosioides,  Philodendron bipinnatifidum [ 9], cinnamon oil, eucalyptus oil, lemongrass oil, peppermint oil, citronella oil, turpentine oil [ 10], citronella oil [ 11],  Tithonia diversifolia (Hemsl.)
4: A.
5: Gray [ 12],  O. basilicum L. from Italy [ 13], and Iranian geranium oil [ 14].
6: The composition of two species of mint ( Mentha suaveolens Ehrh.
7: and  Mentha rotundifolia) grown in Orastie-Romania has been comparatively examinated [ 15].
8: From the 21 plant essential oils (cinnamon, clove, geranium, lemon, lime, orange and rosemary, aniseed, eucalyptus, and camphor) tested against six bacterial species four Gram-negative bacteria ( Escherichia coli,  Klebsiella pneumoniae,  Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and  Proteus vulgaris) and two Gram-positive bacteria  Bacillus subtilis and  Staphylococcus aureus [ 16], 19 oils showed antibacterial activity.
0: Consumers are worried about the presence of chemical preservatives, which can lead to benzoic acid by the decarboxylating action of some spoilage microorganisms, and this is considered the cause of many carcinogenic and teratogenic attributes and residual toxicity.
1: Therefore, the studies to find natural and socially acceptable preservatives receive increasing attention by screening the composition and the biological, antimicrobial, and antioxidant activities of plant extracts [ 17].
2: Essential oils can prevent fungal growth in food products, which may cause spoilage and result in a reduction in the quality and quantity of food (shelf-life).
3: Most EOs applied directly onto food or in the vapor phase can reduce or stop the colony forming ability of molds.
4: They are also regarded as safe (GRAS) and are accepted by the FDA and by consumers.
5: By their potential antimicrobial/antifungal/antioxidant effects, EOs could be the answer to the current search for environmental solutions and to assuring the microbial safety of food products in active packaging applications [ 18, 19].
0: In this study, four essential oils, namely, thyme ( Thymus vulgaris L.), clove ( Eugenia caryophyllus from dried floral buds of  Syzygium aromaticum), rosemary ( Rosmarinus officinalis L.), and tea tree ( Melaleuca alternifolia aetheroleum) obtained from Romanian production (Fares Co., Orastie, Romania) are intent to be used as components in bioactive food packaging.
1: Therefore, as a first step, it should be worthwhile to comparatively evaluate the composition and antimicrobial/antioxidant activity of these four EOs.
2: Antifungal and antibacterial activity against three target food spoilage fungi ( Aspergillus brasiliensis,  Fusarium graminearum, and  Penicillium corylophilum) and three potential pathogenic food bacteria ( S. aureus,  E. coli, and  L. monocytogenes) have been evaluated.
3: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) concentration was established in each case.
4: The antioxidant activity was determined, and the most efficient oil for each type of activity was established.
5: Preliminary tests on the EO encapsulation into chitosan films and their antimicrobial activity against the spoilage of beef meat showed promising results, a detailed presentation for which will be provided in a future paper.

0: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is defined as a spectrum of chronic liver disorders caused by irregular accumulation of fat in liver tissue which results in steatosis, inflammation, and in severe cases, cirrhosis.
1: NAFLD is categorized into two main types including simple steatosis (fatty liver) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.
2: The former is usually considered as a benign condition, whereas the latter has severe complications such as inflammation, hepatocellular injury, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.
3: [ 1]
0: Today, NAFLD is one of the most popular chronic liver disorders, especially in developed countries, with a prevalence of 20%30%, which is estimated to be increased due to the unhealthy pattern of diet rich in high-fat and high-carbohydrate foods.
1: [ 2] Intake of lipogenic sugars including fructose and sucrose, trans-fatty acids and saturated fats as well as insulin resistance is demonstrated to play an important role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD.
2: [ 134]
0: The current treatment approaches for the management of NAFLD include lifestyle modification, antioxidant therapy, oral antidiabetics, lipid-lowering agents, surgical interventions, and in the end stage of hepatic injury, liver transplantation; however, not all of the mentioned choices provide acceptable result and are not always well tolerated by patients in long-term use.

2: [ 121314]
0: Different extracts and essential oil of anise showed antibacterial and antifungal activity against pathogens such as  Staphylococcus aureus,  Streptococcus pyogenes,  Escherichia coli, and several species of the fungus,  Candida.
1: [ 11] A double-blind, randomized clinical trial demonstrated beneficial effects of anise fruit in the treatment of dyspepsia.
2: It decreased gastrointestinal complications and improved quality of life in patients with functional dyspepsia.
3: [ 1516] In a study by Jamshidzadeh  et al., different extracts and essential oil of anise fruit showed hepatoprotective activity in human hepatoma cell line.
4: The preparations also decreased cellular and oxidative damage caused by CCl 4 in liver tissue of Sprague-Dawley rats.
5: [ 17] Anise fruit also showed antidiabetic and lipid-lowering activity in a clinical trial in type 2 diabetic patients which was, at list in part, explained by its antioxidant activity.
6: [ 18]
0: Taking into account the above-mentioned information regarding the biological activities of anise fruits in ancient and modern medicine, the current study has been performed to assess possible effect of  P. anisum fruit extract as well as essential oil in animal model of NAFLD.
1: For this purpose, biochemical parameters related to NAFLD along with histopathological investigation of liver tissue have been considered as primary outcomes.
2: As oxidative stress has a major role in pathophysiology of NAFLD, the biomarkers associated with oxidative stress have been also determined as secondary outcomes.
0: Introduction
0: Apiaceae (Umbelliferae) is one of the largest families of flowering plants with more than 3500 species spread across 455 genera (Arbizu et al., 2014).
1: In Turkey, it is represented by 101 genera belonging to 485 species included in 511 taxa and endemism rate of the family is about 37.3% with 181 species (Ozhatay et al., 2009; Baser and Krmer, 2014).
2: Lake District of Turkey located on the boundary between Mediterranean and Iran-Turan geographic regions is very rich in the number of plant species, particularly in Apiaceae family.

5: However, our recent field observations in the region showed the species spread at elevations between 400-1560 m in Lakes Region of Turkey in C3 Antalya, Isparta and Burdur (Karadogan et al., 2016).
6: Similar to the other taxa of the genus  Kundmannia, K. anatolica produces essential oils, which can be extracted from different parts of the plant, including the fruit, root and flower as well as stem and leafs, with significant diversity in yield and composition.
7: In general, the relative composition of essential oils varies remarkably with geographical position, climate conditions and several other factors (Arruda et al., 2012).
8: There are many studies related to the essential oils in Apiaceae species.
9: To our best knowledge, there is no study performed on the chemical composition of fruit from  K. anatolica, but essential oil compounds and antimicrobial activity of aerial parts of the specie has been recently reported by Paksoy et al.
10: (2016).
11: Some studies on the essential oil composition of fruit and aerial parts from  K. sicula growing in Algeria and Tunisia have been carried out (Djarri et al., 2008; Abderrahim et al., 2013; Faidi et al., 2014).
0: However, this study was aimed at testing possible altitudinal effect on volatile chemical constituents of essential oil obtained from the fruits of  K. anatolica growing spontaneously in different altitudes of Lakes Region in Turkey.
1: This is the first report on the composition of essential oils from  K. anatolica fruits.
0: Introduction
0: Aromatic plants fragrance and biological properties arise from their Essential oils.
1: Availability, fewer side-effects, and reduced toxicity of some aromatic medicinal plants resulted in their application for treating infectious diseases in different phytotherapy manuals (Lee et al., 2007).
2: Today, plant materials play key role in primary healthcare remedies in many developing countries (Zakaria, 1991).
3: Anti-microbial properties of physiologically active principles in medicinal herbs have led to their exploitation in traditional medicine for the treatment of various ailments (Kelmanson et al., 2000; Srinivasan et al., 2001).
4: Throughout history, numerous plant oils have been used for food safety and quality improvement (Yang et al., 2015).
5: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp., and  Streptococci are among common foodborne pathogenic bacteria frequently isolated from various foods such as meat, dairy products, seafood and vegetables (Pirbalouti et al., 2010).
6: Food poisoning is caused due to consumption of foods Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria contaminated.
7: Essential oils are complex mixtures of volatile secondary metabolites compsed of mono- and sesquiterpenes such as carbohydrates, alcohols, ethers, aldehydes, and ketones, which are responsible for the fragrant and biological properties of aromatic medicinal plants (Senatore, et al.
8: 2004).
9: The genus  Dracocephalum L. is composed of about 60 species; also, eight species of  Dracocephalum grow as wild herbs in regions of Iran with high altitude.
10: Several studies have been conducted on identity and biological properties of the mentioned species (Fattahi, et al., 2013; Yousefzadeh, et al., 2013).
11: Dracocephalum kotschyi Boiss is native to Iran and grows wild at regions with 2000-3200 m altitude in Lorestan, Fars, Golestan, Hamadan, Mazandaran and Tehran provinces.
12: D. kotschyi is a short perennial herb that is woody below, its stems are 10-20 cm long and covered, and has small pubescent leaves that are calyx two-lipped, with upper lip three-toothed, stamens, and flowers in verticillasters in the ails of upper leaves (Mozaffarian, 2008).
13: In traditional medicine,  D.kotschyi is applied as a warm herbal medicine for rheumatoid diseases and stomach disorders treatment.
14: Its effectiveness for headaches, congestion, and liver disorders has been described as well (Zargari, 1995).
15: Moreover, Antihyperlipidemic (Sajjadi et al., 1998), anti-epimastigote (Saeidnia et al., 2004) and antivisceral (Golshani et al., 2004) effects are among the other properties reported for  D. kotschyi.
16: D.kotschyi herb is known as Sama in Lorestan locally and it is traditionally used in cooking meat and fish and dairy processing (Local People Interview) and there is a possibility that the use of this traditional herb could reduce the microbial load of the meat and dairy products.
0: In the research that has been already conducted on  D.kotschyi essential oil, it is made clear that the chemical compounds found in the essential oil of this species presents major changes under different climatic conditions (Morteza-Semnani and Saeedi, 2005; Saeidnia et al., 2007; Yaghmai and Taffazoli 1988).
1: Since the mountainous Lorestan Province climate is different from the points the reports of which are already available, an so far the  D.kotschyi chemotype oil grows in Lorestan mountains is not reported, and there is no history of research about the antioxidant, cytotoxic and antimicrobial effects of this plant, in this study while addressing the chemical compositions of  D.kotschyi grown in Garrin Mountain and the comparison its compounds with  D.kotschyi grown in other regions, the antioxidant, cytotoxic and antimicrobial activity of this species was studied.
0: Introduction
0: The use of essential oils to control many diseases and their effective usage as antimicrobial agents ( 1- 5) in addition to their use as functional ingredients in foods, drinks, toiletries and cosmetics is gaining momentum, both for the growing interest of consumers in ingredients from natural sources and also because of increasing concern about potentially harmful synthetic additives ( 6).
1: Essential oils are complex mixture of natural compounds, mostly of plant origin, extremely volatile and with an intense odour.
2: Even if they represent only a small fraction of the plant from which they are derived, they give the whole plant the characteristic of aromatic smell for which these plants are employed by drug, food and perfume industries ( 7).
3: The species that show the largest content of essential oils belong to many families as Asteraceae, Lamiaceae, Apiaceae, Rutaceae, Lauraceae, Myrtaceae, Magnoliaceae, Pinaceae and Cupressaceae ( 8- 10).
0: Family Cupressaceae is a common ornamental plants, cultivated around the world, and particularly in South America, Mediterranean basin and North Africa, It is the most widely distributed of all gymnosperm families, occurring in diverse habitats on all continents.
1: Cupressaceae is also the most important conifer family in modern horticulture, members of this family are important for their timber, resin, fruit and as ornamentals ( 11- 13).
0: Several species belonging to family Cupressaceae have been used in folk medicine as astringent, antiseptic, pulmonary antiseptic, antispasmodic, lymphatic tonic, antibacterial, antihemorrhagic, capillary protector, antipyretic and pelvic decongestant ( 14).
1: Many biologically active compounds have been reported from Cupressaceae species such as essential oils, diterpenes, flavonoids, and sterols ( 14,  15).
0: Genus  Cupressus comprising about 20 species;  Cupressus sempervirens L. commonly known as Cypress and known in Arabic as Saru, Sarw, Serwal, Sharbin and Shagaret el Hayat ( 16), is native to eastern North America ( 17) and grown in Egypt as ornamental tree.

0: Introduction
0:  Oils and fats have important roles in cooking, frying and salad dressings or in food formulations; they make an important contribution to our diet and our health.
1: Omega-3 ( 3) fatty acids such as linolenic acid, and omega-6 ( 6) fatty acids such as linoleic acid, are essential fatty acids; thus, they must be supplied through foods.
2: Today, most of the oils consumed in our daily diet such as corn, sunflower, rice bran and grape seed oils have a high amount of  6fatty acids and therefore, lead to  6: 3 ratio increases ranging from 8-12:1; however, this ratio should be 4:1.
3: 1
0:   3 and  6 fatty acids are essential for normal growth and have an important role in the prevention of cancer and cardiovascular diseases as well as the improvement of immune function.
1: The  6 eicosanoids without  3 fatty acids are pro-inflammatory and may lead to high blood pressure, cardiovascular diseases and arthritis.
2: 1 Therefore, their balance is very important in our daily intake.
0:  Different fats/oils have various chemical and physical properties.
1: Pure vegetable oils can have low functional characterization or nutritional properties.
2: For example, using olive oil or sesame oil alone has some drawbacks such as their low amount of  3 essential fatty acids.
3: Instead, flaxseed oil is a rich source of  3, tocopherols and other bioactive compounds, 2 but in pure form it is very unstable and oxidizes quickly.
0:  Sesame oil is a good source of  6 fatty acids and has a considerable level of sesamin and sesamolin lignans, which have different bioactive and health promoting effects.
1: 3 Furthermore, sesame oil has anti-inflammatory activity and antiproliferative effects on cancer cells caused by tocopherol homologues.
2: 4,  5 Sesame oil in spite of containing 85% unsaturated fatty acids, is one of the most stable vegetable oils to oxidation.
3: 6 However, sesame oil, which has positive nutritious and healthy effects, is low in  3 fatty acids and because of its high price has limited application in the food industry.
0:  Olive oil is a good source of  9 and bioactive compounds such as phenolic compounds and phytosterols 7,  8 and because of its fatty acid composition and natural antioxidants such as tocopherols and polyphenols, it is more stable to heat treatments.
1: 9
0:  Consuming edible oils with a suitable ratio of essential fatty acids, appropriate stability to heat treatment and storage is a very important issue in the food industry.
1: Unfortunately, no pure oil has both an ideal fatty acid composition and good oxidative stability.
0:  Blending is the simplest physical and economical procedure to change fatty acid composition, increase the bioactive components and natural antioxidants and make a new at an affordable price.
1: 10,  11
0:  Flaxseed and products fortified with flaxseed powder and oil is gaining more attention because of its valuable nutritional properties.
1: 12 In the present study, flaxseed oil was blended with sesame and olive oils in different ratios to provide optimal essential fatty acids with a suitable stability and high bioactive content.
2: These mixtures were stored at different temperatures to study the feasibility of introducing these functional vegetable oils to the market.

0: Salvia (sage) is the largest genus of the Lamiaceae family, which is native of the Mediterranean area and includes about 900 species (Walker et al., 2004[ 55]).
1: From its Latin name  Salvia, meaning to cure, it is used in folk medicine for their antibacterial (Ozcan et al., 2009[ 40]), antitumoral (Cardile et al., 2009[ 7]), antidiabetic (Kim et al., 2007[ 22]), and antioxidant (Kolak et al., 2009[ 25]) activities.
2: Sage is also used traditionally in food preparation, herbal tea (Demirci et al., 2005[ 11]), flavoring agents in perfumery and cosmetics (Delamare Longaray et al., 2007[ 10]).
0: In Tunisia, numerous  Salvia species were investigated.
1: Among them,  Salviaofficinalis was encountered in different national parks all along Tunisian territory and considered as a medicinal herb with an interesting essential oil (EO) potential (Chemli, 1997[ 8]).
0: Despite the medicinal potential of various plants in Tunisia, at our knowledge, few studies explored the biological activities of this plant.
1: Most of them reported antibacterial, antifungal and antioxidant activities of  S. officinalis essential oil (SoEO) (Bouaziz et al., 2009[ 5]; Fellah et al., 2006[ 15]; Hayouni et al., 2008[ 20]).
2: Furthermore, there are many reports concerning essential oils from this species in other countries (Delamare Longaray et al., 2007[ 10]; Tepe et al., 2005[ 53]).
0: These properties make the SoEO very promising as a source of botanical insecticides.
1: This aspect has been largely exploited in the case of EOs from rosemary and other aromatic plants, which are effective against Lepidoptera and Coleoptera larvae (El Abdouni Khiyari et al., 2014[ 12]; Santana-Meridas et al., 2014[ 46]).
2: At our knowledge, insecticidal activity of Tunisian SoEO has not yet been investigated.
3: Moreover, allelopathic properties of  Salvia genus were also reported and the first studies that demonstrated the presence of volatile growth inhibitors produced by  Salvia species were carried out on  S. leucophylla and  S. apiana by Muller and Muller (1964[ 37]).
4: The effects of EOs extracted from  S. hierosolymitana and  S. multicaulis on germination and initial radical elongation of  Raphanus sativus L. (radish) and  Lepidium sativum L. (garden cress) showed different activities against the tested species (Mancini et al., 2009[ 32]), while the phytotoxic activity of the SoEO from Tunisia has not been reported before.
0: Knowing that the activity of EOs from aromatic plants could be affected by several factors such as the geographical origin, the genetic background of the plant from which the EO was obtained (Pattnaik et al., 1997[ 41]), the aims of this study were (i) to determine the chemical composition of essential oil extracted from  S. officinalis from Tunisia (ii) to assess antioxidant activity, (iii) to test antimicrobial activity against some pathogens and phytopathogen strains, (iv) to test insecticidal activity against  Spodoptera littoralis larvae and  Tribolium castaneum adults and (v) to evaluate its effects on seed germination and radical and hypocotyl elongation.

0: Introduction
0: Elyonurus hensii is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of South America (Brazil and Argentina), Africa (Congo Republic, Gabon, DR Congo, Angola), and Australia (Yang et al.,  2013).
1: Elyonurus hensii has been studied in only the Republic of Congo, where this plant grows spontaneously on the Plateau des Cataractes.
2: It is usually used by local people as a theiforme drink to relieve pain, which justifies its vernacular name tikoni (pain).
0: The first description of the chemical profile of the essential oils from different parts (roots, stems, leaves, and flowers) showed that the oils from the aerial parts were mainly rich in  pmenthadienol isomers, and the main ones are  cis and  transpmentha1(7),8dien2ol,  cis and  transpmentha2,8dien1ol.
1: The essential oil of the roots is rather rich in sesquiterpene compounds, and aristolone, with a content of approximately 40%, is the major compound.
2: (Silou, Loubaki, Figueredo, & Chalchat,  2006).
3: Studies of the essential oils of species of the genus  Elyonurus are very limited; however, it appears that  Elyonurus hensii is the only species of the genus that is rich in  pmenthadienol isomers.
4: However, these isomers are present at significant contents in the oils of  Cymbopogon giganteus and  Cymbopogon densiflorus.
5: Indeed, the essential oil of  Cymbopogon giganteus from the Ivory Coast is characterized by high contents of  cis and  transpmentha2,8dien1ol (8.7% and 18,4%, respectively) and  cis and  transpmentha1(7),8dien2ol (16% and 15.7%, respectively), and this oil presents antimicrobial properties (Boti et al.,  2006).
6: Moreover, the antimicrobial properties were also observed on the essential oil of  Cymbopogon giganteus from Burkina Faso (Menut et al.,  2000), Cameroon (Jirovetz, Buchbauer, Eller, Ngassoum, & Maponmetsem,  2007), Benin (Ayedoun, Sohounhloue, Menut, Lamaty, & Bessiere,  1999), and Mali (Sidibe, Chalchat, Garry, & Hamara,  2001); these species produce essential oils rich in  pmenthadienol isomers.
7: The essential oil from the flowers and leaves of  Cymbopogon densiflorus of Zambia is also rich in  pmenthadienol isomers, and it contains 22.4%  transpmentha2,8dien1ol and 11.1%  cispmentha1(7),8dien2ol.
8: The oil of the Brazilian plant presents a similar composition (Boelens,  1994; Chisowa,  1997).
9: The literature reports several uses of  Cymbopogon densiflorus: the crushed leaves are used as a treatment for rheumatism in Gabon, the flower head is smoked in a pipe as a cure for bronchial affections in Malawi, and the plant sap is used in the CongoBrazzaville, where it is also given as a treatment for asthma and to calm fits (Akhila,  2010).
10: Manifestly, the essential oil of  Cymbopogon densiflorus exhibits biological activities.
11: The massive presence of  pmenthadienol isomers in the essential oil of  Elyonurus hensii points also to possible antimicrobial properties.
12: Aristolone is also an interesting constituent since it is likely to induce an antalgic activity (TianShung, Amooru, Damu, & Kuo,  2004).
0: In a previous study of  Elyonurus hensii from CongoBrazzaville, (1) the volatile components from the stems and the roots were obtained by hydrodistillation and headspace solid phase microextraction (HSSPME), and (2) for the extracts obtained with methanol, ethyl acetate and dichloromethane, the antioxidant activities of the extracts were demonstrated and compared.
1: The essential oil of  Elyonurus hensii did not have significant properties of DPPH and ABTS .+ for either the stems or the roots.
2: However, the solvent extracts are effective antioxidants according to in vitro assays.
3: The authors conclude that the extracts of  Elyonurus hensii have potential as natural additives for the food and pharmaceutical industries (Yang et al.,  2013).
0: The use of experimental designs can improve the yields of essential oil.
1: They also optimize the extraction of the major constituents of the essential oils by organizing the steam distillation with a minimum number of experiments to be performed (Silou, Malanda, & Loubaki,  2004; Silou et al.,  2009).
2: Taking into account the scientific interest that seems to represent the isomers of  pmenthadienol and aristolone, we have tried to optimize the extraction of these major constituents by using a 2 n full factorial design.
3: We have used a simple model of the first degree which gives the representation of the response function based on variables, which allows us to evaluate the influence of different factors studied on the contents of the aristolone and  pmenthadienol isomers.

1: Introduction
0: The genus  Ocotea is not a monophyletic group of the Lauraceae, which includes about 400 species occurring mostly in tropical and subtropical regions (Central and South America, the West Indies, and Africa) [ 1, 2].
1: These species present alternate penninerved leaves; inflorescenses thyrsopaniculate to botryoid.
2: Flowers are trimerous, bisexual, polygamous, or unisexual; tepals equal, rarely persistent on the rim; nine fertile stamens, the third whorl with glands; anthers with four loculos; receptacle very small and deeply tubular; in male flowers, rudimentary ovary to absent; fruit and cupule extremely variable in size and shape [ 1].
3: It is a very variable genus morphologically, being the largest genus in the Neotropics, with 170 species occurring in Brazil [ 3, 4].
0: The economic importance of  Ocotea species in the Amazon region has been related to numerous applications such as the use of their wood in lightweight construction and luxury furniture [ 5].
1: Phytochemical studies reported the occurrence of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, neolignans, catechins from leaves and bark of  O. porosa [ 6, 7]; aporphine alkaloids from leaves of  O. macrophylla; flavonols from  O. vellosiana; and eudesmane sesquiterpenoids from  O. corymbosa [ 8, 9, 10].
2: The volatile chemical profiles of  Ocotea species are characterized by high concentrations of phenylpropanoids and terpenoids (hydrocarbons or oxygenated) [ 11, 12].
0: Many studies have been reported on the biological activities of  Ocotea metabolites: the alkaloid reticuline isolated from extract of  O. duckei showed potent central nervous system depressant action [ 13].
1: ()-Caaverine, a noraporphine alkaloid isolated from  O. lancifolia, has shown high antiprotozoal activity against  Leishmania and  Trypanosoma cruzi parasites [ 14].
2: The chloroform fraction obtained from an extract of fruits of  O. puberula and the alkaloid dicentrine displayed antinociceptive effects [ 15].
3: The butanolides isolated from roots of  O. macrocarpa showed good cytotoxic activities against the A2780 ovarian cell line [ 16].
4: The flavonoids of  O. notata showed antimycobacterial activity and ability to inhibit NO production by macrophages [ 17].
5: The essential oil of  O. quixos, rich in  trans-cinnamaldehyde and methyl cinnamate, showed anti-inflammatory properties in vitro and in vivo models [ 18].
6: Studies on the chemical characteristics of the species  O. caudata,  O. cujumary, and  O. caniculata are rare and important because  Ocotea species are classified as threatened to extinction by the Brazilian List and the risk of extinction is increased due the reduction of genetic variability [ 19, 20] so knowledge of the genetic diversity is necessary for our understanding of the factors that determine essential oil quantity and quality in these economically important species [ 21].

1: Introduction
0: The genus  Aloysia belongs to the Verbenaceae family and consists of approximately 200 species of herbs, shrubs, and small trees which are often aromatic [ 1].
1: The species  Aloysia citriodora Palau or  Lippia citriodora (H.B.
2: & K.) is commonly known as Lemon Verbena, Verbena grass Louise, Arabic tea, and lemongrass.
3: This plant is growing spontaneously in South America, especially in Argentina and Chile.
4: In Morocco, this species is cultivated for more than a century and has been used in folk medicine as herbal tea preparations, for its antispasmodic, digestive, stomachic, sedative, and antipyretic properties.
5: The essential oil extracted from the dried leaves of  A. citriodora is indicated for anxiety, stress, insomnia, some depressions, nervous fatigue, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, tachycardia, rheumatism, enterocolitis, Crohn's disease, anorexia, dyspepsia, intestinal parasites (amebiasis and amebic cysts), and prevention of asthma attacks [ 2 4].
6: The broad range of biological activities of essential oils could be generally correlated to the chemical composition.
7: Therefore, this biological difference can be partly explained by the variation in their chemical composition [ 5].
8: It is well established that sesquiterpenoids and their derivatives are credited with many biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiasthmatic, and antifungal properties [ 6].
9: Thus, structure-activity relationships describe broad classes of activities for the different chemical groups of molecules found in essential oils.
0: In the present study, we analyzed the chemical composition analysis; the cytotoxic and the antibacterial activities of essential oil of  A. citriodora distilled from the shade-dried leaves harvested in the summer season (July-August 2015) in different Moroccan regions.

1: Introduction
0: Plants producing essential oils represent a large part of natural flora and an important resource in various fields such as the pharmaceutical, food, and cosmetic industries, thanks to their flavour, fragrance, and biological activities [ 1].
1: Essential oils are a complex mixture of hydrocarbons and oxygenated hydrocarbons arising from the isoprenoid pathways and secreted by glandular trichomes disseminated mainly onto the surface of plant organs; therefore, they have a pivotal role in the growth and colonization of plants, conferring colour and scent to reproductive organs, attracting pollinators and favouring seed dispersal [ 2].
2: Furthermore, they seem to mediate the plant relationship with abiotic (e.g., light, temperature, and so on) and biotic factors, playing a defensive role against herbivores, harmful insects, and microbial pathogens [ 2].
0: More than 250 types of essential oils are commercialized annually on the international market, some of which are employed in aromatherapy and for the treatment of several diseases including cardiovascular and neurological diseases, diabetes, and cancer [ 1].
1: Moreover, the antimicrobial properties of essential oils have been widely recognized [ 3, 4, 5, 6] thanks to several studies which showed a synergistic effect of several components of essential oils against various human pathogens [ 1].
2: Essential oils have been used since ancient times, in folk medicine throughout the world, to preserve a good health status [ 6, 7, 8, 9].
3: Presently, several properties and therapeutic effects have been ascribed to essential oils such as antibiotic, rubefacient, anaesthetic, antispasmodic, balmy-expectorant, repellent, carminative, as well as beneficial effects on the central and peripheral nervous system [ 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15].
0: Recently, antimicrobial drug resistance has brought researchers to evaluate novel antimicrobial lead molecules to treat various human pathogens.
1: Synthetic drugs have often failed this goal, if not for a lack of efficacy, because of the greater risk to which the patient was exposed (acute and chronic toxicity and environmental hazard potential), leading the researchers to better explore natural remedies [ 1].
2: From this point of view, the study of essential oils has undergone a remarkable growth, and many new plants producing essential oil have been evaluated [ 16, 17, 18, 19, 20].
3: Among these, the authors decided to put their attention on  Pistacia vera L., a nut tree that belongs to the Anacardiaceae family [ 21] cultivated in Iran, Turkey, the USA, Syria, Italy, Tunisia, and Greece.
0: In Italy, pistachio crops are typically Sicilian, mainly grown in the territory of Bronte (CT), situated on the eastern part of Sicily and characterized by lava-rich soils and very particular climatic conditions [ 21, 22] which confer to the pistachio nuts superior organoleptic and nutritional characteristics.
1: For this reason, the European Union recognized the variety Bronte as a D.O.P.
2: (Protected Designation of Origin) product.
3: Pistachio nuts are considered a rich source of many important biofunctional compounds that are useful for the human diet and known for their various pharmacological properties such as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, insecticidal, and anti-nociceptive activities [ 23].
4: Recently, we analysed and described the nutraceutical, antioxidant, and cytoprotective activity of crude phenols and anthocyanins-rich extracts derived from ripe pistachio hulls ( Pistacia vera L., variety Bronte), a by-product of the pistachio industry [ 23, 24].
5: These studies managed to identify this matrix as a promising source of healthy compounds.
6: The results obtained highlighted antioxidant and cytoprotective properties directly correlated to the high total phenol content, in particular flavonols, phenolic acid, and flavan-3-ols and, among anthocyanins, to the high content of cyanidyn-3- O-galactoside [ 23, 24].
7: The presence of these compounds makes pistachio hulls an attractive source of health-promoting compounds, which are potentially helpful against several oxidative stress-related diseases.
0: Despite the well-known ethnopharmacological relevance of some essential oils derived from some species of the genus  Pistacia ( P. atlantica Desf and  P. integerrima J.L.
1: Stewart ex Brandis) against several diseases, particularly those affecting the respiratory and the gastrointestinal tract [ 25, 26, 27, 28], no literature data concerning the hull essential oil composition and biological properties of  Pistacia vera L., variety Bronte, are today available.
0: Having considered the above, we have for the first time performed, a phytochemical characterization of ripe pistachio hull essential oil followed by the evaluation of antioxidant, cytoprotective, and antiperoxidative properties through cell-free and cell-based assays.
1: The antimicrobial activity against some Gram-positive and Gram-negative standard and clinical bacterial has also been investigated.
0: Background
0: Free radicals instigate oxidative damage and when this free radical in the body system is above the capacity of antioxidant, it results in oxidative stress which is implicated in many human diseases [ 1].
1: Antioxidant is substance that helps to prevent oxidative damage when found in small amounts and is equivalent to an oxidizable substrate.
2: Antioxidants aid in averting of diseases by scavenging radicals including lipid peroxyl (LP ), superoxide (O 2 ), nitric oxide (NO ) and hydroxyl (HO ) formed during metabolic activities [ 2].
3: The need for natural antioxidants is becoming imperative due to numerous health risk associated with synthetic antioxidants [ 3].
4: Several in vitro assays such as DPPH, ABTS, lipid peroxyl and ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) radicals have been used in evaluating antioxidants capacity of plants extracts which are designed based on quenching stable free radicals [ 4].
5: Plants used traditionally are known to produce a wide range of compounds with therapeutic properties such as antioxidant, antibacterial, gastroprotective effects amongst others [ 5].
0: Study has shown that the continuous use of synthetic antibiotics for a long period is one of the causes of bacterial resistant [ 6].
1: The treatment failures associated with multidrug-resistant bacterial strains including methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA), vancomycin-resistant  Enterococcus faecalis, Vibrio Spp .
2: and  Escherichia coli have become a worldwide concern [ 7], which has heightened the search for alternative therapeutic agents [ 8].
3: The use of herbal medicine for the treatment of diseases has been stated by World Health Organization (WHO) and presently a lot of persons use herbal medicine for treatment of diverse disease [ 9,  10].
4: Plant extracts provide boundless opportunities for such option as well as in discovery of new drugs because of availability of potent chemical components present in their extracts [ 11,  12].
5: The active compound found in medicinal plants that exhibit therapeutic activities against pathogens have little or no side effects on the host cells [ 13].
6: Phytochemical compounds present in the essential oil (EO) of plants are diverse, complicated and are known to contain active antibacterial property [ 14] and antioxidant properties [ 15].
7: Essential oils from medicinal plants contain naturally occurring antimicrobial compounds which have been shown to be effective in limiting the growth and survival of many pathogens [ 16].
8: These essential oils from plant such as  Eucalyptus,  Pogostemon cablin and tea tree have been reported to exhibit antimicrobial potential [ 17], and this make EO appropriate option to synthetic antibiotics [ 18].
0: Tagetes minuta is commonly called wild marigold also known as Mexican marigold of the family  Asteraceae [ 19], and it belongs to one of the 56 species of  Tagetes [ 20].
1: T. minuta is found in many countries such as Argentina and South America [ 21], including South Africa.
2: T. minuta is commonly called nnkayo by the Xkosa people, a tribe in the Easter Cape Province, South Africa.
3: T. minuta has been reported to have a long record of human use for insect repellent, treatment of stomach and intestinal diseases [ 22].
4: There has been heightened interest of late in plant-based natural products that have the ability to reduce free radicals formation and treating infections caused by pathogenic microorganisms.
5: There is however scarce information on antibacterial and antioxidant properties as well as the chemical constituents of the essential oil flower of  T. minuta grown in Cala community, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa that is claimed to be potent against many infections.
6: This study therefore aimed to evaluate antibacterial, antioxidant properties and the chemical constituents of the essential oil of  T. minuta flower grown in Cala community South Africa.
0: Introduction
0: The lack of animal protein in the human diet is one of the most characteristics of developing countries.
1: This protein deficiency, particularly, affects children.
2: In Republic of Benin, fishing has an important role in national socio-economic balance and contributes about 3% to gross domestic product (GDP) [ 1].
3: However, conservation of fish is became difficult due to the lack of adequate conservation system, and climatic and environmental conditions are favorable to its rapid degradation [ 2].
4: Among these fish species is  Galeoides decadactylus, is a very nutritious fish, mainly marine and commonly used for the production of fermented fish in Benin [ 3].
5: To reduce these post-capture losses, several artisanal treatments are carried out.
6: Among these, the fermentation of fish is nowadays one of the most conservation methods used.
7: During the production, producers get losses of products because of unpleasant practices and uncontrolled phenomena [ 4].
8: Moreover, fermentation is an important method of processing and preserving, as it generally improves nutritional characteristics of fermented products.
9: It is therefore associated with salting or drying, with the aim of reducing water activity and delaying or preventing the rapid proliferation of proteolytic and putrefactive bacteria [ 2].
10: In Benin the technique used to produce fermented fish is fermentation with salting and drying, and the product obtained is known as Lanhouin [ 5].
11: It is widely used in southern Benin as flavor enhancers [ 2].
12: However, despite the very nutritious nature of these dried and salted fermented fish, several problems related to their hygienic quality as well as their suitability for conservation still remain [ 6].
13: According to CECAF (Fishery Committee for the Eastern Central Atlantic), over than one hundred species of fish lived in marine waters under Benin jurisdiction and fish biomass was estimated at over than 9660 tons of pelagic fish and about 6000 tons of demersal fish [ 3].
14: Among demersal fish species are the Lesser African Threadfin ( Galeoides decadactylus).
15: Its post-harvest losses are very important because of the very soft nature of its fleshes.
16: Various treatments are performed to reduce these losses.
17: The fermentation and drying to produce the lanhouin is one of the control strategies of loss reduction currently used in Benin [ 4].
18: However, a lot of problems on the microbiological quality of this fermented fish was reported [ 3].
0: The restrictions imposed by international food organism on the use of chemical synthesis preservatives due to health and environmental risks [ 7] increasingly encourage the use of essential oils in food preservation [ 8].
1: Essential oils as well as derived compounds possess a wide range of activities of which, the antimicrobial activity is most studied [ 9,  10].
2: Their applications as preservatives in food or antiseptics and disinfectants have been widely investigated [ 11].
3: Several studies have revealed the antimicrobial and antioxidant properties of essential oils [ 12] which could be an effective alternative to the use of synthetic chemical preservatives in food conservation.
0: Plants belonging to Myrtaceae family like  Pimenta racemosa have retained the attention of researchers, not only because of their high diversity and their distribution around the world, but also for their variable use in popular medicines to treat diseases [ 13].
1: In Benin, the leaves of this plant are used in culinary preparations where the species is known as laurel leaf.
2: Thus the present study aims to investigate the efficacy of the essential oil extracted from the leaves of  Pimenta racemosa in the improvement of producing technology and the nutritional and microbiological qualities of fermented fish flours produced.
0: Introduction
0: The promotion of European plant derived products (particularly those coming from rural areas), such as, wines and spirits, with specific characteristics determined by the geographical origin, including the area of production, has experienced a significant increase, especially in the last decade (Qin et al.,  2012).
1: This reflects the large popularity of these local products, which particularly in Spain benefit from a great acceptance.
2: Some examples of Protected Geographical Indications (PGI) include liquors, such as, Cantueso alicantino, Palo de Mallorca or Ratafia catalana; anise-flavored spirits like Anis Paloma Monforte del Cid, Hierbas Ibicencas and Hierbas de Mallorca; or other alcoholic drinks, such as, Herbero de la Sierra Mariola, Aperitivo Cafe de Alcoy, Aguardiente de hierbas de Galicia, and Pacharan de Navarra (E-Spirits-Drinks,  2017).
3: Many of them are made in the Eastern part of the Iberian Peninsula or in the Balearic Islands as an evolution of traditional herbal preparations, which nowadays have a social use as drinks in family gatherings and festivals.
0: Most of the ingredients in these preparations are aromatic plants that have been used in traditional medicine for centuries (Liang et al.,  2004; Bouaziz et al.,  2009).
1: The majority are Lamiaceae, such as,  Salvia species, intensively studied because of their economic interest for food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical preparations (Durling et al.,  2007; Longaray Delamare et al.,  2007; Walch et al.,  2011; Orhan et al.,  2012).
2: In particular,  S. officinalis L. subsp.
3: officinalis and S.  officinalis L. subsp.
4: lavandulifolia (Vahl) Gams (syn.
5: S. lavandulifolia Vahl) have been largely investigated due to their biological activities as anti-nociceptive, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and inhibitor of cholinesterase activity (Bakkali et al.,  2008; Adorjan and Buchbauer,  2010; Ramos et al.,  2010; Kennedy and Wightman,  2011; Walch et al.,  2011).
6: In addition, S.  officinalis subsp.
7: lavandulifolia is the accepted source for the Spanish sage oil in the European Pharmacopoeia (EDQM,  2016) and other standards (AENOR,  2001; ISO,  2005).
0: In Valencian region (Spain), several wild and cultivated  Salvia species are traditionally used in folk medicine as herbal tea or for digestive liquors (Martinez-Frances and Rios,  2005).
1: Among them,  S. blancoana Webb.
2: Heldr.
3: subsp.
4: mariolensis Figuerola, an Iberolevantine endemism, S.  officinalis subsp.
5: lavandulifolia and their hybrid  S. x hegelmaieri Porta Rigo, are increasingly found in local markets, especially in the Southern part of Valencia region (Martinez-Frances et al.,  2012).
6: Thus, quality control of the herbal raw material is important for a proper commercialization of these species.
7: Identification using morphological and/or chemical markers is an essential step of this control.
0: Taxonomy of Iberian  Salvia species related to  S. officinalis, such as,  S. blancoana, and the previously known as  S. lavandulifolia, is controversial regarding their status and level (Alcaraz and De la Torre,  1988; Alcaraz et al.,  1988; Bolos and Vigo,  1995; Laguna et al.,  1998; Lopez,  2001; Reales et al.,  2004; Serra,  2007; Saez,  2010; Mateo and Crespo,  2014).
1: In the case of  S. blancoana, a consensus exist of its status as species, including several subspecies, among them  S. blancoana subsp.
2: mariolensis (Laguna et al.,  1998; Reales et al.,  2004; Serra,  2007; Mateo and Crespo,  2014) which is mainly distributed in the AlcoyDenia eastern mountains, reaching the AyoraVillena western mountains, a region between North of Alicante province and South of Valencia province (Serra,  2007).
0: Essential oil composition of Iberian sages has been extensively studied (Marcos Sanz et al.,  1988; Guillen and Manzanos,  1999; Jordan et al.,  2009; Herraiz-Penalver et al.,  2010; Ramos et al.,  2010; Martinez-Frances et al.,  2012; Santana et al.,  2012).
1: However, an exhaustive chemical characterization of the oil of  S. blancoana subsp.
2: mariolensis an  S. x hegelmaieri is lacking.
0: There is a need of a better morphological and chemical knowledge of  S. blancoana subsp.
1: mariolensis, which could help the establishment of quality specifications for the herbal materials and improve the opportunities of marketing the herbal preparations thereof such as, teas and traditional liquors under controlled conditions.
2: For this reason, the aims of the present paper were: to analyze the ethnopharmacological knowledge reported about  S. blancoana subsp.
3: mariolensis in comparison with S.  officinalis subsp.
4: lavandulifolia; to clarify the main morphological characters that can help the identification and differentiation of the sages marketed in the studied area; to characterize the essential oil of  S. blancoana subsp.
5: mariolensis by GC-FID (Gas Chromatography with Flame Ionization Detector) and GC-MS (Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry) and comparing its composition with those of closely related taxa; and to develop a method of identification by HPTLC (High Performance Thin Layer Chromatography) to distinguish  S. blancoana subsp.
6: mariolensis from other  Salvia taxa currently found in Valencia region, that could be routinely applied for quality control of herbal material.
0: INTRODUCTION
0: The extensive use of chemical antimicrobial and antiseptic agents in human mediation as well as in animal breeding led to the selection of resistant strains permitting the development of resistance, which is a biological phenomenon very hard to remove.
1: There are a few decades; several diseases appeared under control using antibiotics.
2: Scientific and technological progress believed in a possible eradication of many diseases;[ 1] however, the resistance developed increasingly by microorganisms and the regular emergence of new infectious agents have denied this optimistic prognosis.
0: Faced with this phenomenon, the discovery of new antibacterial molecules that could provide an alternative to the use of conventional antibiotics which became ineffective seems an absolute necessity.
1: The research tracks are numerous, but the exploration of natural resources appears to be more promising because they constitute, by their biodiversity, the largest reserve of active substances and especially the medicinal and aromatic plants, which are the source of high-value products, such as essential oils (EOs).
0: The genus  Mentha, known as peppermint, is a cultivated natural hybrid of  Mentha aquatic L. (water mint) and  Mentha spicata L. (spearmint).
1: Although being a native genus of the Mediterranean region, it is cultivated all over the world and the EO of this plant has been reported by other works for its insecticidal,[ 2] antimicrobial,[ 3] antioxidant effects.
2: [ 4]
0: The present study aims to investigate the chemical composition of Moroccan  M. piperita EO, to assess its antimicrobial activity against seven bacteria and two fungi causing spoiling and pathogenicity, in an attempt to contribute to the use of these as alternative products for microbial control and food preservation.
0: Background
0: Citrus are the most important crops in the world in terms of production according to the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO), with 240,780 million metric tons produced in 2013 [ 1].
1: Citrus plants are grown in many countries all over the world and among the major African citrus-producing countries is Tunisia.
2: Thus,  Citrus would be considered as one of the most economically important crops in Tunisia.
3: The genus  Citrus belongs to the  Rutaceae family that comprises of about 140 genera and 1300 species and, for instance,  Citrus limon (Lemon) is among important species of genus  Citrus [ 2].
4: Essential oils were composed of many valuable natural products that may be described as mixtures of hydrocarbons, oxygenated compounds and nonvolatile residues.
5: They include terpenes, sesquiterpenes, aldehydes, alcohols, esters and sterols [ 3].
6: Citrus plants constitute one of the main sources of essential oil, which are extensively studied for their potential uses in the food industry [ 4].
0: Foods contaminated with  Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and  Salmonella has been reported as the causal agents of foodborne diseases [ 5,  6].
1: One of the most important psychrotrophic food pathogens related to anaerobically packed cooked meat products and shelf-life failures of conserved foods is  Listeria monocytogenes.
2: This organism is the causal agent of listeriosis, a disease that can be serious and is often fatal in susceptible individuals, caused by eating contaminated food [ 7].
3: Thus, to prevent contamination during the production, sale and distribution and to extend the shelf life time of raw and/or processed foods, synthetic additives should be used.
4: However, there is a strong debate about the safety aspects of these chemical preservatives since they are considered responsible for many carcinogenic and teratogenic attributes as well as residual toxicity [ 8].
5: Thus, a growing attention is being paid to plants and herbs naturally derived compounds as a new alternative to prevent the proliferation of microorganism and protect food from oxidation.
6: Generally, little information exists on the in vivo antimicrobial efficacy of plant essential oils against food-borne pathogens in meat.
7: To the best of our knowledge, the antimicrobial activity of  Citrus limon essential oil ( ClEO) against a wide range of food-associated microorganisms (bacteria, moulds, and yeasts) has not been studied.
8: The purposes of the present work were (i) to evaluate the chemical composition of Tunisian lemon EO ( ClEO) by GC-MS, (ii) to study in vitro the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of  ClEO, (iii) to assess the effect of  ClEO on physicochemical of raw minced beef meat stored at 4 C, and (iv) to determine the efficacy of  ClEO in inhibiting  L. monocytogenes growth in raw minced beef meat during refrigerated storage.

0: Nigella sativa, an annual flowering plant of Ranunculaceae family, has been used in traditional medicine throughout Middle Eastern countries, such as Asia, Africa, and India, for various ailments.
1: It is commonly used to treat asthma, 1, 2 but a recent study of  N. sativa demonstrated the multiple mechanisms of actions for a range of therapeutic uses.
2: These include its use in the remedy to treat hypercholesterolemia in menopausal women, with more benefits and less side effects than from other single pharmacological agents.
3: 3
0: The results of another study showed that methanolic extract of  N. sativa seed inhibits SiHa human cervical cancer cell proliferation through apoptotic induction.
1: It was found that the results of one study suggest an association between p38 not p38 and oral cancer development.
2: Additionally, the anti cancer activity of thymoquinone (TQ) indicated that the antitumor activity of TQ may be attributed to the downregulation of p38 MAPK.
3: 5
0: N. sativa can efficiently reduce the number of cells with NF200 at all the CA1, CA2, and CA3 regions of hippocampus and parietal and frontal areas of the rats brain;  N. sativa can be used as a potential preventive supplement compound for the treatment of Alzheimers disease.
1: 6 It is also used as an antitumor agent, 7, 8 diuretic agent, 9 analgesic agent, 10 anti-cestode and anti-nematode agent, 11 antidiabetic agent, 12, 13 bactericide, 14 and antiulcerogenic agent.
2: 15 The antioxidant effect of  N. sativa oil and its components may represent another mechanism that contributes to its antimalarial activity.
3: 16
0: The desirable effect of  N. sativa on human diseases may be due to the presence of active compounds (ie, polyunsaturated fatty acids, TQ, phenolic compounds, and other natural anti-oxidants) in  N. sativa oil composition.
1: N. sativa seed contains 26.6% oil, of which the major fatty acids are linoleic acid (LA, 64.6%) and palmitic acid (20.4%) as reported in a previous study.
2: 17 Cheikh-Rouhou et al 18 also found that LA was the major unsaturated fatty acid in  N. sativa (50.3% Tunisian  NS and 49.2% Iranian  NS).
3: It was found that  N. sativa seeds contain 36%38% fixed oils, proteins, alkaloids, saponin, and 0.4%2.5% essential oil, and it was reported that the  N. sativa essential oil is mainly composed of TQ (27.8%57.0%), -cymene (7.1%15.5%), carvacrol (5.8%11.6%), t-anethole (0.25%2.3%), 4-terpineol (2%6.6%), and longifolene (1.0%8.0%).
4: 19 Fatty acid profiles were identified for  N. sativa seed oils.
5: Also LA and oleic acids are the main fatty acids of  N. sativa essential oil.
6: In addition, the  N. sativa essential oil contains considerable amounts of myristic acid (C14:0), arachidic acid (C20:0), and behenic acid (C22:0).
7: 20
0: Most properties of whole seeds or their extracts are mainly attributed to quinine constituents, TQ is the most abundant compound.
1: 21 TQ, as the main constituent of the volatile oil from  N. sativa seeds, has been reported to possess strong anti-oxidant properties.
2: 22 Based on a previous study, TQ, carvacrol, t-anethole, and 4-terpineol were identified as active antioxidants and radical scavenging compounds in  N. sativa.
3: 23 TQ can be used for the treatment of fungal skin infections.
4: 24 Previous researchers reported different contents of TQ that ranged from 27.8% to 57% in several Australian  N. sativa oils.
5: 23
0: N. sativa oil is traditionally obtained by mechanical pressing or treating powdered  N. sativa seed with organic solvents, most commonly hexane.
1: Conventional solvent extraction techniques produce low-quality oil that requires extensive purification operations resulting in thermal degradation and loss of valuable compounds.
2: 25 The use of organic solvents and the necessity of recovering the solvent have led to a move toward cleaner extraction methods, such as supercritical fluid extraction (SFE).
3: SFE is becoming an efficient and worldwide used technique to obtain valuable natural substances from complex materials.
4: SFE-CO 2 has been utilized as a nontoxic alternative to hexane and other organic solvents for the extraction of oil from corn germ, 26 cottonseed, 27 rapeseed, 28 and other oil-bearing materials.
5: 29 Thus, the main objective of this study was to compare the oil extraction efficiency and essential oil composition of Iranian and Indian  N. sativa L. oil extracted by SFE and solvent extraction techniques.
0: Chemicals and materials, such as  N. sativa seed (black cumin seed), were purchased from local markets in Iran and India.
1: The pure standard of TQ (66%) and LA (60%) were provided by Aldrich Chemical Company (Milwaukee, WI, USA).
2: High-performance liquid chromatography grade methanol and n-hexane were supplied by Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA, USA).

1: Introduction
0: D. cinerea is a tree growing in tropical areas in countries such as Cameroon, Kenya, South Africa, and Tanzania, where a decoction of its leaves and roots is used against venereal disease, eye inflammations, skin diseases, and snake bites.
1: The root is used for chest complaints and the twigs for gonorrhoea and syphilis.
2: The essential oil was toxic to mosquito vectors of bancroftian filariasis [ 26].
0: E. giganteus is a perennial herb widely used in African traditional medicine for the treatment of various ailments [ 31, 32].
1: In previous studies, the root methanolic extract showed significant antibacterial [ 33], antifungal [ 34], and antioxidant effects [ 35].
2: The cytotoxicity of the crude methanol extract from the roots has also been demonstrated [ 36, 37].
0: Overall, these Cameroonian plants are also traditionally used to control populations of arthropod pests [ 38, 39, 40].
1: In this research, we shed light on the growth inhibitory potential of the essential oils obtained from the leaves of  A. indica,  A. daniellii, and  C. anisata; the seeds of  A. melegueta and  D. cinerea; and the roots of  E. giganteus against  T. brucei TC221.
2: Selected pure constituents from the above mentioned essential oils were also evaluated.
0: For centuries, people living in Africa have been facing various infectious tropical illnesses, among which African trypanosomiases are some of the most frequent relevant parasitic diseases.
1: African trypanosomiases, commonly called sleeping sickness in humans (HAT; Human African Trypanosomiasis) and Nagana in domestic livestock, affect a huge number of people living in poverty in 36 sub-Saharan countries and hence have a key socioeconomic impact [ 1, 2, 3].
2: After a century of outbreaks, due to political instability and a lack of funding, around 70 million people and 50 million cattle are still at risk of exposure in Africa [ 4].
0: Trypanosomiasis is transmitted by the bite of insects from the  Glossina spp.
1: (Glossinidae) and is fatal in humans, if untreated.
2: While taking a blood meal, infected  Glossina flies can spread extracellular protozoans from the species  Trypanosoma brucei.
3: There are three morphologically indistinguishable subspecies of  T. brucei.
4: The subspecies  T. b. gambiense is responsible for a chronic form of the human disease, while  T. b. rhodesiense causes an acute form, which more rapidly leads to death.
5: Both subspecies are infective to humans, whereas  T. b. brucei is only infective to animals.
6: During the early stage of the disease or the hemolymphatic phase, the parasite is restricted to the blood and lymph, and, after months or years, it invades the central nervous system, resulting in various neurological symptoms, including sleeping disturbance [ 3].
0: As for other neglected tropical diseases, the chemotherapeutical arsenal against HAT is based on limited, expensive, and often toxic medicines that are administered parentally in a context of poverty and a lack of qualified personnel in healthcare centers.
1: The few drugs that are available are pentamidine and suramin for the early stage of the disease and eflornithine (also in combination with nifurtimox) and melarsoprol, an organoarsenic compound, for the late stage, when the parasite infects the brain.
2: Although melarsoprol can cause severe reactive encephalopathy, it remains a first line treatment for infections by  T. b. gambiense in many rural areas because of the high cost of eflornithine [ 1].
3: Overall, the scenario described above highlights the critical nature of the current situation and the urgent need to explore new sources of potentially effective and safe compounds for therapy.
0: It has been estimated that a large part of the African population relies on herbal medicines as the first-line treatment for different ailments.
1: In this regard, the African flora represents a valuable source of anti-infectious compounds to be exploited as drugs [ 5, 6, 7].
2: In the fight against  Trypanosoma infections, new therapeutic options can be provided by plant extracts, essential oils, and plant-borne compounds [ 6, 8, 9, 10].
3: Essential oils are volatile mixtures distilled from aromatic plants and composed of several dozens of components such as terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, and aliphatic compounds [ 11, 12].
4: In recent years, an increasing interest on essential oils as alternative/integrative therapies in the treatment of HAT has been observed [ 13].
5: Essential oils and representative components from lemongrass ( Cymbopogon citratus (DC.)

7: and L.M.
8: Perry), basil ( Ocimum basilicum L.), and yarrow ( Achillea millefolium L.) exhibited efficacy both in in vitro and in vivo models of trypanosomal infections [ 14].
9: Essential oils are composed of a plethora of chemical compounds, which have various modes of action on microorganisms, and, additionally, essential oils do not induce any form of resistance [ 15].
0: In the present study, we selected a panel of Cameroonian medicinal and aromatic plants as potential sources of anti-trypanocidal compounds.
1: We focused on  Azadirachta indica A. Juss (Meliaceae),  Aframomum melegueta K. Schum.
2: (Zingiberaceae),  Aframomum daniellii (Hook.

0: A. indica, also known as neem tree, is considered by many people living in Africa as a miraculous plant for a wide range of uses in ethnopharmacology such as anthelmintic, antimalarial, anti-inflammatory purposes and for healing skin diseases.
1: Most of these properties were then confirmed by scientific reports [ 16, 17, 18].
2: All parts of the plant can be used for medicinal purposes, including the seed oil extracted by mechanical pressure [ 19, 20].
3: Notably, the ethanolic extract obtained from neem stem bark exhibited activity against  T. b. brucei [ 21], whereas the leaf essential oil has been barely investigated to date.
0: A. melegueta, also known as alligator pepper or grain of paradise, is a perennial plant native to western Africa, and its seeds are used as a spice in food due to their aromatic flavor and pungent taste or as ingredients of ethnomedical preparations for the treatment of snakebites, stomachaches, and diarrhea [ 22].
1: Antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antioxidant properties have been reported for alligator pepper [ 23].
2: Concerning seed volatile constituents, they showed repellent activity against adults of the maize weevil  Sitophilus zeamais [ 24].
0: A. daniellii, also known as African cardamom, is an herbaceous plant traditionally used in Africa as a spice due to the pungent taste of its seeds, whereas, for medicinal purposes, the plant is employed as a laxative and for curing parasitic and other microbial infections [ 25, 26].
1: The anti-inflammatory effect of its seed essential oil and the preservative properties in stored grains have also been reported [ 27, 28].
0: C. anisata is an evergreen tropical tree up to 10 m tall with leaves containing secretory glands and emitting a strong smell [ 29].
1: In Africa, it is considered highly effective against insects and has also been used in the treatment of malaria [ 30].
0: Background
0: From the earliest times, medicinal plants have been widely used as natural drugs in the treatment, curing and prevention of disease [ 1].
1: Among these are bacterial diseases [ 2 4].
2: While facing increasing bacterial resistance against routinely used traditional and synthetic antibiotics for the treatment of microbial diseases [ 5 7], we find that research in plant-based natural products to elucidate new therapies from novel antibacterial agents has grown significantly [ 8,  9].
3: Studies report that certain natural antibacterials, when given with standard antibiotics, are even more effective in synergy than the standard drug alone [ 10 12].
4: In the cells of resistant pathogens, these naturally occurring molecules supposedly reach different targets than the known antibiotics do.
0: Among various natural substances with antimicrobial potential, essential oils have been highlighted.
1: These generally consist of a mixture of natural volatile chemical compounds, such as monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, and their oxygenated derivatives [ 13].
2: Such compounds comprise the secondary metabolites of aromatic plants, which are considered to be natural remedies [ 14,  15] with antimicrobial activity [ 16 20].
3: They may therefore be an alternative to overcome the increasing antibacterial resistance of pathogens.
4: Essential oils are also being investigated by some researchers for their anti-cancer potential [ 21,  22].
0: Among the aromatic plants whose essential oils are extracted, a promising candidate is an endemic savanna tree, widely distributed in Brazil, that belongs to the family Anacardiaceae:  Myracrodruon urundeuva (Aroeira of the backwoods) [ 23].
1: This plant has been noted for its antimicrobial potential, which was evidenced when molecules obtained from crude extracts of  M. urundeuva were found to have antibacterial and antifungal properties [ 24 27].
2: Additionally, other studies indicate antiparasitic [ 28], analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties [ 29], encouraging research on the possible uses for this substance in herbal medicine.
0: The essential oil extracted from the leaves of  M. urundeuva comprises a blend of terpenes which have not yet been fully elucidated.
1: Based on these premises, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of essential oil extracted from the leaves of  M. urundeuva, which is typically grown in northeastern Brazil.
0: Introduction
0: Depression is a major chronic psychiatric dis-order affecting nearly 21% of the world population and imposes a substantial health burden on the society ( 1).
1: People with a depressed mood are characterized by despair, loss of interest in daily working and social relationship, sadness, anxiety, hopelessness, helplessness, and guilt ( 2).
2: There are three main kinds of classical antidepressants in clinical practice, including tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and desipramine), selec-tive serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) including moclobemide and tranylcypromine.
3: Although approved antidepre-ssant drugs are effective, a significant number of people do not efficiently respond.
4: In addition, these drugs are accompanied with many adverse effects ( 3,  4).
5: Accordingly, there is a need for the development of new drugs with more efficacies and less adverse effects.
6: Natural products displaying antidepressant effects are of great interest and may be important sources of new antidepressant drugs ( 5,  6).
0: Cinnamon (sweet wood) the brown bark of  Cinnamomumverum (true cinnamon tree or Ceylon cinnamon tree), belonging to the Lauraceae family, is native to Southern India and Sri Lanka.
1: Since ancient times cinnamon has been commonly used as a spice and flavoring material for desserts, candies, chocolate, etc.
2: ; it has a long history as a medicine, as well.
3: Medieval physicians used cinnamon to treat a variety of disorders including headaches, neuralgia, gastritis, coughing, hoarseness, sore throats, etc.
4: ( 7).
5: In many experimental as well as clinical studies, cinnamon has been demonstrated to possess anti-inflammatory ( 8,  9), anti-oxidant ( 10), anti-diabetic ( 11,  12) anti-microbial ( 13), analgesic ( 14) and wound-healing ( 15) properties.
6: Anticancer ( 16), lipid-lowering ( 17), and cardiovascular- disease protective effects of this compound have also been investigated ( 18).
7: In addition, cinnamon has shown promising effects against neurological disorders, such as Parkinsons and Alzheimers diseases ( 19,  20).
0: The specific aim of this study was to examine whether the essential oil obtained from cinnamon bark has anti-anxiety and/or antidepressant-like properties in acute (triple doses) or sub-acute regimen (14 days), in behavioral models of anxiety and depression in mice.

0: Garlic ( Allium sativum L., Amaryllidaceae) likely originated in Central Asia [ 1].
1: The plant has been used as a flavoring agent and a traditional medicine since antiquity, and is now cultivated worldwide [ 1, 2].
2: Allium vineale L. (wild garlic, crow garlic) is native to Great Britain, most of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.
3: The plant has been introduced to North America, Australia, and New Zealand [ 3].
0: Allium sativum has been used as a diaphoretic, diuretic, expectorant, and stimulant [ 4].
1: Extracts of  A. sativum have shown broad-spectrum antibacterial [ 5] and antifungal [ 6] activity and the plant has been used to treat tuberculosis, coughs, and colds [ 7].
2: Garlic preparations have demonstrated hypotensive activity in moderately hypertensive subjects, and garlic-based phytotherapeutic products are used in France for minor vascular disorders [ 8].
3: There is an inverse correlation between regular consumption of garlic and stomach cancer frequency [ 8], but there seems to be no correlation between garlic consumption and other cancers.
4: Garlic has been used in food preparation not only for its flavor, but also as a digestive aid [ 4].
5: Allium vineale has been used as a substitute for  A. sativum in cooking; the bulb is used as a flavoring agent and the leaves as an addition to salad [ 9, 10].
6: Cherokee Native Americans used both  A. vineale and  A. sativum as carminatives, diuretics, and expectorants [ 11, 12].
0: Although there have been numerous investigations on the phytochemistry of garlic ( A. sativum) [ 1, 13, 14], the chemistry of wild garlic ( A. vineale) has not been investigated, and because of the history of the uses of  Allium species as both condiments and phytopharmaceuticals, we have investigated the essential oil compositions of  A. sativum from Spain, obtained by different isolation methods, and  A. vineale growing wild in north Alabama, USA.
0: Background
0: During the last few decades, the pork market has been subjected to several changes influenced by consumer demands, which have focused the production toward healthier, safer, and tastier meat.
1: The intramuscular fat (IMF) is crucial for meat palatability, such as tenderness and juiciness, and is an important economic trait in pork production [ 1 3].
2: Besides the IMF amounts, consumers are becoming increasingly interested in food containing high concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA).
3: PUFA are considered as functional ingredients to prevent cardiovascular disease [ 4,  5].
4: Hence, meat producers require producing and supplying meat that contains appropriately higher IMF and PUFA.
0: Dietary methods to manipulate the fat quantity and composition of pork have been previously reported, including low-protein or lysine-deficient diets [ 3,  6,  7].
1: A reduced protein diet promoted pork with higher IMF percentage which was more monounsaturated and less polyunsaturated even when balanced with essential amino acids [ 2,  8].
2: The tissue-specific increase of expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase could be one reason for higher de novo synthesis of fatty acids in muscle of pigs fed reduced protein diets [ 9].
3: However, unsaturated fatty acids are more sensitive to oxidation than saturated fatty acids (SFA) and particularly vulnerable to peroxidative attack [ 10].
4: Moreover, the lipid oxidation in muscle is a major deterioration of nutritional and sensory properties of meat and meat products [ 11].
0: Synthetic and natural antioxidants have been used to delay the lipid oxidation in pork [ 12].
1: Herbal feed additives and organic acid have been suggested as desirable alternatives to benefit growth performance of the pigs by improving the gut health.
2: Oregano essential oil (OEO) contains the natural and volatile aromatic compounds that exert different biological actions, such as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative activities [ 13].
3: Carvacrol and thymol, the two main phenolic derivatives that constitute about 81.9 and 3.5% of OEO, are principally responsible for the activities [ 13,  14].
4: In addition, other minor constituents such as -terpinene and -cymene, two monoterpene hydrocarbons that constitute about 4.49 and 3.07% of OEO, respectively, also contribute to the activities [ 15,  16].
5: In our previous studies, we found that OEO can improve growth performance [ 17], intestinal barrier integrity [ 18], and antioxidant enzyme activities in the intestinal tissues [ 19].
0: Benzoic acid (BA), as a kind of organic acid, was authorized to be used in growing pigs at the dose of 0.5% to 1.0% by European Union in 2003 [ 20].
1: Certain research has proposed that BA can improve the growth performance [ 21], intestinal antioxidant capacity [ 22], and microecological balance [ 23].
2: In addition, previous studies have reported that the combination of herbal essential oils with organic acid produced a synergistic effect on antibacterial activity [ 24,  25].
3: However, there is little available information on the effects of long-term the combination of OEO and BA supplementation to a low-protein, amino acid-supplemented diet on antioxidant properties and fatty acid composition of pork production.
0: Therefore, we firstly evaluated the effects on meat quality of reducing the dietary protein concentration by one to three percentage units.
1: Secondly, our objective was to investigate the effects of long-term OEO and BA supplementation to a reduced-protein, amino acid-supplemented diet on physical and chemical parameters, fatty acid composition, lipid stability, and sensory profile of  longissimus thoracis (LT) muscle in growing-finishing pigs.
0: Background
0: Vector-borne diseases remain a major public health concern in tropical areas [ 1].
1: Poor drainage systems in urban areas, especially during rainy seasons, and irrigation ditches in farmland provide abundant mosquito breeding places [ 1 3].
2: Tanzania spends a low share of its gross domestic product (7.2%) on health, with a meagre public expenditure of 39% for health costs [ 4].
3: Vector-borne diseases affecting people in Tanzania are malaria, filariasis, dengue, chikungunya and other arboviruses [ 5].
4: Malaria remains the deadliest vector-borne disease despite long-term control efforts [ 6].
5: Among the mosquito-borne vectors,  Ae.
6: aegypti (L.), a vector of dengue fever, is prevalent in the tropics and sub-tropics and is closely associated with human habitats outside its native range of Africa [ 7].
7: Culex pipiens pallens (Coquillett) is a vector of the western Nile virus and is distributed throughout Africa, the Middle East and Asia [ 8].
8: The complex sibling species of  An.
9: gambiae which transmit malaria worldwide have been described [ 9].
10: All of these vector-borne diseases occur mainly in tropical countries where more than two billion people live in endemic regions [ 10].
11: The approaches to combating vector-borne diseases relies on the interruption of the disease transmission cycle by either targeting the adult or larvae through spraying breeding sites or targeting adults using insecticides [ 11].
12: Synthetic pesticides have been extensively used for mosquito control by either killing the vectors, preventing adult mosquitoes from biting humans or by killing mosquito larvae at breeding sites [ 12,  13].
13: However, the development of resistance to different classes of synthetic insecticides such as pyrethroids, organophosphates, organochlorides and carbamates has drawn attention to the search of alternative methods of control [ 14].
14: The toxicity of the available chemical insecticides, their high operational cost and the subsequent environmental pollution have caused the need for developing alternative approaches to control vector-borne diseases [ 15].
15: Plant extracts with proven mosquito control potential can be used in place of synthetic insecticides, either as insecticides for killing larvae or adult mosquitoes or as repellents for protection against mosquito bites.
16: Amongst them, essential oils have gained a special interest due to their insecticidal properties [ 16] andin recent years, have proved to be potentially useful sources of bioactive compounds against mosquito larvae [ 17] .
17: Essential oils are composed of isoprenoid compounds, mainly monoterpene carriers of smell in the aromatic plants, such as sesquiterpenes alcohols identified from  Chamaecyparis obtusa leaf oil and various monoterpene components derived from  Thuja orientalis [ 18].
0: A number of studies have been conducted on essential oils to determine their larvicidal and repellency activities.
1: Cinnamon umzeylanicum,  Cymbopogon citrates,  Lavandula angustifolia,  Tanacetum vulgare,  Rubdosia melissoides,  Eugenia caryophyllata,  Ocimum spp.,  Gaultheria procumbens,  Cuminum cymium,  Bunium persicum,  Trachyspermum ammi,  Foeniculum vulgare,  Abelmoschus moschatus,  Cedrus spp.
2: and  Piper spp.
3: have been found to be effective for pest control [ 19].
4: Other essential oils such as lemon grass ( Cymbopogon winteriana), eucalyptus ( Eucalyptus globules), rosemary ( Rosemarinus officinalis), vetiver ( Vetiveria zizanoides), clove ( Eugenia caryophyllus) and thyme ( Thymus vulgaris) are known for their pest control properties [ 19].
5: Another study, conducted on the repellent effect of essential oils from  Cymbopogon spp.,  Ocimum spp., and  Eucalyptus spp.
6: showed their strong repellency against malaria vectors and other mosquitoes [ 12].
0: Apart from essential oils, extracts prepared from Tanzanian plants have been evaluated for their larvicidal activity.
1: For instance, extracts from  Annona muricata,  Annona senegalensis and  Annona squamosa were active against  Culex quinquefasciatus, which demonstrated that extracts of  Annona species grown in Tanzania could be potential anti-mosquito agents [ 20].
2: In spite of the anti-mosquito activities of several studied species of plants, relatively little work has been done on the larvicidal activities of essential oils extracted from spices, such as clove and cinnamon.
3: A recent study carried out in Nigeria assessed the activity of clove essential oils against  Ae.
4: aegypti and  Cx.
5: quinquefasciatus and achieved over 85% larval mortality within 24-hourspost-exposure [ 21].
6: Meanwhile, in Thailand, lemongrass and clove essential oils were effective in causing mortality for all larval stages of  An.

7: demonstrated cytotoxic activity against human cancer cell lines [ 9, 10].
8: Additionally,  A. marina extracts showed antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacterial and fungal strains [ 11].
0: A. schaueriana Stapf & Leechm ex.
1: Moldenke, also called black mangrove or siriuba, is one of the native Brazilian mangrove species.
2: The antimicrobial activity of  A. schaueriana extracts has been reported [ 2, 8].
3: However, essential oils from this species have never been evaluated for its chemical composition or biological activities.
4: In the genus, only the  A. marina leaf and fruit oils have been analyzed, presenting 2,6-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-methylphenol (BHT) (41.91%) and 2-phenyl-1,3-butadiene (24.56%) as major components for the leaf oils, and methyl palmitate (41.9%), methyl  p-vinylbenzoate (9.68%) and methyl ester ( 9Z,15 Z)-9,15-octadecadienoic acid (8.28%) for the fruit oils [ 12, 13].
5: Hence, this study aims to evaluate the composition of leaf essential oils from two  A. schaueriana specimens and to compare their in vitro antimicrobial and antioxidant activities.

1: Introduction
0: Candidiasis is the most frequent infection caused by opportunistic fungi, with a very extensive spectrum ranging from mild manifestations (e.g., a colonization of mucosal tissues) to systemic infections with the invasion of different organs [ 1].
1: Candida albicans is the most common causative agent in humans, but the species  Candida tropicalis,  Candida parapsilosis,  Candida glabrata, and  Candida krusei are also commonly associated with serious infections [ 2, 3, 4].
2: In addition,  C. glabrata and  C. krusei are described as having intrinsic resistance to some of the more conventional antifungal drugs [ 5, 6].
0: Azole antifungal agents are the most used in therapeutic regimens for the treatment of candidiasis.
1: However, these antibiotics are not always successful because of the significant incidence of microorganism resistance [ 7].
2: This has stimulated the search for new antifungal agents in order to increase the number of alternatives to treat infections and minimize the impact of resistance.
0: Natural products have been traditionally used to treat many diseases, including fungal infections, and plant compounds have been explored by the pharmaceutical industry for use as antimicrobial agents or as models for the synthesis of new drugs [ 8].
1: Essential oils, which consist in liquid, are volatile, and are rarely colored mixtures of compounds soluble in organic solvents, are among these potential alternatives [ 9, 10].
2: The essential oils are usually constituted by some components at high concentrations (2070%), being deemed majoritary compounds, while the other components are present in trace amounts [ 11].
0: Plants from Caatinga and Atlantic Forest have also been used to obtain natural medicines by Brazilian local populations [ 12].
1: However, despite the rich flora of these biomes, the biotechnological potential of plants as sources of antifungal agents has not been extensively studied.
2: Thus, screening programs are very important in order to prospect for compounds for developing new antimicrobial drugs.
0: This study was conducted with essential oils from three medicinal plants of Brazilian flora.
1: Hymenaea courbaril var.
2: courbaril (Fabaceae) has a broad distribution being found in Brazil at Atlantic and Amazon Forests, Caatinga, Cerrado, and Pantanal.
3: It has several medicinal uses; for example, the stem bark decoction or syrup can be used against coughs and anemia, and leaf infusion can be used against urinary tract disorders [ 13, 14].
4: Myroxylon peruiferum (Fabaceae) is found at the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and Cerrado and has heavy wood that is resistant to deterioration.
5: Its bark is used as an anti-inflammatory, and the fruits are used to alleviate earache [ 15, 16].
6: The leaves of  Vismia guianensis (Hypericaceae) are used against problems in spine and kidneys as well as to alleviate pains in general [ 17].
7: This plant can be found in the Amazon and Atlantic Forests [ 13].
0: The aim of this work was to determine the chemical composition of essential oils from leaves of  H. courbaril var.
1: courbaril,  M. peruiferum, and  V. guianensis and to evaluate the antifungal activity of them against  Candida species.

1: Introduction
0: Spices play a crucial role in nutrition, medicine and fragrance industry.
1: The genus  Aframomum (family: Zingiberaceae) contains almost fifty species in West and Central Africa [ 1].
2: The distinguishing feature of this genus is the attribute of highly pungent and aromatic seeds [ 2].
3: All the plant parts also exude a strong aroma when pulverized.
4: A. danielli is a perennial plant with seeds used for flavouring traditional dishes, in addition to having laxative, anti-helmintic and anti-fungal properties; juice extract of its rhizomes are effective in the treatment of body odor and toothache [ 3].
5: The seed essential oil composition of  A. danielli from Cameroon, Nigeria and S. Tome has been reported [ 4, 5, 6].
6: Similarly, volatile constituents of other  Aframomum species grown in some regions of West and East Africa have been investigated [ 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13].
0: Some biological activities such as antiprotozoal, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities have been documented for a number of  Aframomum species [ 12, 13, 14, 15, 16].
1: However, there is a paucity of data on the volatile oil composition of other aromatic parts of  Aframomum danielli, other than the seed oils earlier reported.
2: Moreover, there is an upsurge in the search for natural antioxidants especially of plant origin to protect the human body from free radicals, as well as to hinder the progress of many chronic diseases and of rancidity in food.
3: This work was therefore carried out to determine the composition and antioxidant activity of volatile oils from the seed, leaf, rhizome, stem and pod of  A. danielli.

1: Introduction
0: The global interest in food preservation has been recently greatly increased due to high economic costs of deterioration and poisoning of food products through lipid oxidation as well as food pathogens.
1: Currently, there is a growing interest in prolonging shelf-life and the safety of food using natural antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds.
2: This aspect assumes particular relevance due to an increased resistance of some bacterial and fungi strains to the most common antibiotics and antimicrobial synthetic agents [ 1].
3: Essential oils or some of their components have been largely used in perfumes, in sanitary products, in dentistry, in agriculture, as food preservers and additives, and as naturals remedies [ 2].
0: Mostly found in Europe, Asia, and temperate regions including North America, the  Achillea genus, belonging to Asteraceae family, is represented by about 85 species [ 3].
1: A. millefolium (common yarrow) has been used in many applications such as medicine, veterinary science, and cosmetics [ 4].
2: The flowering herbs were reported as possessing tonic, antispasmodic, vulnerary, and diaphoretic activities, among others, and therefore is recommended for colds, flatulence, hysteria, and rheumatism treatments [ 5].
3: The chemical composition of  A. millefolium oils from Quebec [ 6], India [ 7], Turkey [ 3], Iran [ 8], and European countries (Macedonia, Italy, Lithuania, Hungary, Greece, Moldavia, Latvia, Germany Estonia, Belgium, France, Russia, Armenia, Spain, and Bulgaria) [ 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] has been reported in previous studies.
4: However, the reports on antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of  A. millefolium EO are rather scarce.
5: Considering remarkable chemical polymorphism, which is characteristic of many essential oil-bearing plants, it is of interest to determine the chemical composition and biological activities of plant varieties growing in different regions.
0: Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the antioxidant, the antibacterial, and the antifungal activities of EO of  A. millefolium aerial parts of French origin.
1: Additionally, this study aims to inspect the chemical profile of  A. millefolium EO grown in France and to compare this profile to previous studies where the EO of  A. millefolium was obtained from other countries.

1: Introduction
0: The Rutaceae family has approximately 150 genera distributed worldwide in tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions.
1: The  Zanthoxylum genus comprises more than 200 species, being the most abundant genus in Rutaceae regarding to the number of species.
2: In  Zanthoxylum genus, it is common to find secondary metabolites such as alkaloids, lignans, coumarins, amides, flavonoids, and triterpenes [ 1, 2].
0: In the  Zanthoxylum genus, several biological activitieslarvicidal [ 3], trypanocidal [ 4], anti-tumor [ 5], anti-psoriasis [ 6], and anti-inflammatory [ 7], among othershave been described.
1: In Brazil, people of the state of Rondonia use the tea from leaves and roots of  Zanthoxylium sp.
2: to relieve toothache [ 8].
3: Additionally, the species  Z. simullans and  Z. chalybeum are used for the treatment of malaria [ 9, 10].
0: Essential oils of various species of  Zanthoxylum genus, such as the essential oil from branches of  Z. armantum, which presented strong insecticidal activity against pests that attack stored products [ 11], have had their activities tested.
1: Essential oil from the seeds of the same species has larvicidal activity against  Aedes aegypti, Anopheles stephensi, and  Culex quinquefasciatus, mosquitoes that are vectors of diseases [ 3].
0: The essential oil of  Z. gilletti leaves showed larvicidal activity against  Anopheles gambiae, the mosquito vector of malaria in Africa [ 12].
1: It has also been found that the essential oil  Z. alatum exhibits antifungal and antibacterial activity [ 13], and the essential oil of  Z. simulans exhibits anthelmintic activity [ 14].
2: The methanolic extract and the essential oil from fruits of  Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides and  Zanthoxylum leprieurii presented anti-cancer and anti-microbial properties in vitro assays [ 15].
0: Zanthoxylum monogynum is popularly known as laranjeira-do-mato, tinguaciba-da-restinga, tinguaciba, limao-bravo, or limaozinho, occurring in Brazil in the states of Alagoas, Espirito Santo, Goias, Minas Gerais, Pernambuco, Rio de Janeiro, and Sao Paulo [ 16].
1: The study of Maia and Andrade [ 17] in 2007, with leaves of  Z. monogynum collected in different regions of Brazil, gave rise to two essential oils with different compositions and characteristics.
0: To date, there are no data in the literature about biological activities of the essential oil of  Z. monogynum.
1: The purpose of this study was (i) to give a chemical characterization of  Z. monogynum essential oil, (ii) to investigate its cytotoxic activity in vitro against six tumor cell lines (B16F10, MCF-7, A2058, HeLa, HL-60 and T75), and (iii) to determine the antimicrobial effect of  Z. monogynum essential oil against yeast ( Candida dubliniensis, Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, Candida albicans, Cryptococcus grubii (Serotype A),  Cryptococcus gattii (Serotype B),  Cryptococcus gattii (Serotype C),  Cryptococcus neoformans (Serotype D),  Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains ( Escherichia coli,  Serratia marcescens,  Pseudomonas aeruginosa,  Staphylococcus epidermidis, and  Enterococcus faecalis).

1: Introduction
0: Tanacetum vulgare L. is a perennial herb of the Asteraceae family.
1: This plant grows widely in Europe and Asia.
2: Introduced into North America in the 18th century, it is well adapted to northern climates [ 1].
3: Traditionally,  T. vulgare has been used as an anthelmintic, tonic, emmenagogue, antihypertensive, carminative, antispasmodic, antidiabetic, diuretic, and an anti-inflammatory compound [ 2, 3].
4: Most alcohol extracts of  T. vulgare are reported to have biological effects including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antibacterial properties.
5: Indeed, studies on rats and mice [ 4, 5] have found  T. vulgare extracts to have anti-inflammatory properties.
6: Flavonoids present in the plant could be, in part, responsible for these biological effects [ 5, 6].
7: Shinella et al.
8: demonstrated that parthenolide was the main in vivo anti-inflammatory substance in  T. vulgare [ 5].
9: Methanol extracts from  T. vulgare showed antioxidant activity, probably due to the presence of phenolic compounds [ 7].
10: The antibacterial properties of ethanolic extracts have also been reported in studies using  Escherichia coli and  Staphylococcus aureus [ 8, 9].
0: Regional variability of the chemical composition of  T. vulgare essential oils is well-known and many essential oil chemotypes have been reported in the literature [ 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21].
1: For example,  T. vulgare essential oil chemotypes from Hungary and Argentina are mainly composed of -thujone (72.4% and 91.65%, respectively) [ 15, 20].
2: However,  T. vulgare essential oil chemotypes from Finland and Lithuania [ 10, 12] had, respectively, artemisia ketone (55.08% to 81.36%) and 1,8-cineole (3.6% to 39.7%) as the main constituents.
3: Kumar et al.
4: [ 22] have thoroughly reviewed this chemotype variability of  Tanacetum.
5: Despite the many regional chemotypes, many studies of the biological effects of  T. vulgare essential oils did not analyze the complete chemical composition of the oils nor its constituents in relation to their biological properties.
0: In our study, the essential oil of  T. vulgare, collected from an area in northern Quebec (Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean, Chicoutimi, QC, Canada), was extracted by steam distillation and analyzed using GC-FID (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
1: We assessed the essential oils and its constituents for anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, and cytotoxic activities.
0: Introduction
0: Nature is rich in antibacterial, antifungal, and antioxidant products.
1: Plants are considered as one of the important anti-organism producers.
2: Plants produce various types of secondary metabolites that are characterized by their biological properties, for use against predators and microbial pathogens.
3: One of these secondary metabolites, which have an effective antimicrobial activity, is the essential oil (EO).
4: 1 EOs, also known as essences, volatile oils, etheric oils, or aetheroleum, are natural products that can be produced from different parts of the plants (e.g., flowers, leaves, stems, seeds, fruit, or barks of aromatic plants).
5: The EOs consist of several types of compounds, which are usually liquid, volatile, limpid, with lower density than water, and soluble in organic solvents.
6: Extracting the EOs from different parts of the plants can be done by various chemical techniques such as steam distillation, solvent extraction, expression under pressure, supercritical fluid, and subcritical water extraction.
7: 2
0: Thus, due to the efficiency of EOs as antimicrobials, antioxidants, antitumoral, antifungal and anti-inflammatories, they are widely used in different fields such as the cosmetic industry (e.g., ingredients of fragrances, decorative cosmetic, fine fragrances, and flavoring), the food industry (e.g., aromas and flavors), the pharmaceutical industry (e.g., active components of medicines and as antibacterials/antimicrobials), and aromatherapy.
1: 3
0: Although the EOs are characterized by their efficiency as antibacterial organisms, their effective degree is varied according to their chemical composition, which may vary due to their agriculture, geographic location, seasonal variability, and climatic factors and according to the part of the plant (fruit, leaves, etc.).
1: 4 Nowadays, the determination of the bioactivity of the EOs from their chemical composition is a well-established idea among the scientific community.
2: However, practically, the traditional experimental methods usually have many limitations.
3: Characterizing the complexity of the chemical interactions among the components of EOs is a significant limitation.
4: In addition, defining the relations between these components and the attacked microbes is another limitation.
5: 3 Thus, the importance of using the computational models instead has increased.
6: Developing a computational tool to select the EOs that have antimicrobial activities depending on knowing their effective compounds only and without complex laboratory analysis can save money and time and enhance consistency of final products.
7: Generally, the computational tools (e.g., artificial neural networks [ANNs], genetic algorithm [GA], and particle swarm optimization [PSO]), especially those that are based on mathematical or statistical models (e.g., rough sets [RS] and fuzzy logic), can enhance the ability of determining the relationships among the EOs compounds such as the chemical interactions, synergisms, and antagonisms.
8: Accordingly, these tools may be very useful in classifying, optimizing, and predicting the antibacterial activity of a certain EO depending on the historical analysis of other EOs.
9: 5
0: One of the main challenges faced by scientific researchers in determining the antimicrobial activity of the EOs is the huge number of compounds that constitute the oil and which compounds have the significant antimicrobial effects.
1: In this article, a new computational tool is presented based on RS and PSO algorithms.
2: The proposed tool uses the RS algorithm as a reduction mathematical model to solve the problem of the huge number of EO compounds, which accordingly improves the optimization process that is based on PSO to determine the most proper EO for every type of bacteria.

1: Introduction
0: Citrus medica L. var.
1: sarcodactylis (Noot.)
2: Swingle, commonly known as fingered citron in China, is an uncommon variation of  Citrus medica L., belonging to the Rutaceae family [ 1, 2].
3: It is well-known as a precious Chinese traditional medicine and is widely cultivated from the central area of China, to the southeastern coast, especially in the Jinhua district of the Zhejiang province, lying to the south of Shanghai [ 3].
4: The fruits are widely manufactured for use in various types of processed foods, such as healthcare tea, drink flavoring, succade, and traditional desserts.
5: Also, the intact fresh fruits could be directly sold or used as decorative bonsai at international markets, extending from Asia to South America, mostly due to their unique finger-like appearance and exquisite aroma.
6: However, recently, due to the requirement for the modernization of traditional Chinese herbs, attention has been focused on research relating to bioactive components and the development of advanced processing techniques for fingered citron.
7: In particular, as both a medicinal and edible product, it has been acknowledged that the essential oil of fingered citron is a major component of the commercial sector, with an extensive use as a flavoring agent for beverages, ice cream [ 4], biscuits, cakes, healthcare food [ 5], and household products [ 6, 7].
8: Therefore, in terms of commercialization of fingered citron, it is of utmost importance that we obtain a high-quality essential oil, at the lowest cost possible, during the processing of the fruits.
0: Unlike other citrus fruits such as lemon and grapefruit, mature fingered citron has only a thin yellow exocarp and thick white entoderm, without juicy pulp or seeds [ 2].
1: This peculiar anatomical structure, results in a low proportion of exocarp containing essential oil.
2: Therefore, the total yield of a complete fruit is typically in the range of 0.7%1.2% ( w/ w), as stated in previously published work [ 8, 9].
3: Furthermore, the oil-water state is sometimes impossible to separate, depending on single-circle hydrodistillation, due to the emulsification of a much lower essential oil content into a relatively large amount of water.
4: Therefore, a conventional isolation process for producing essential oil from these fruits usually employs hydrodistillation using condensed fluid, repeatedly returning to the evaporator-like Clevenger apparatus.
5: However, for a practical large-scale production of essential oil, the cost of isolating the essential oil needs to be considered, and the essential oil could be combined with other procedures, such as beverage production.
6: Much research has focused on oil separation following the cold-pressing of citrus fruits, with pulp such as the common orange [ 10], but few investigations have pursued using fingered citrons, which have no pulp.
0: The quality of essential oils produced from fingered citron is highly dependent on its chemical composition, as well as associated bioactivities [ 11].
1: During the course of processing the peels of mature fruits, different isolation techniques can not only result in different oil yields, but can also have noticeable effects on chemical composition and other related oil qualities [ 12, 13].
2: Therefore, owing to potential commercial applications, there have been several investigations that have attempted to demonstrate the composition and stability of characteristic aromas, and to determine possible bioactivities, such as those which are antimicrobial or antioxidant [ 14, 15].
3: The GC-MS analysis of oils from Japanese fingered citron showed that -ionone, one of the aroma components with a very low odor threshold (7 ng/L), was responsible for the characteristic osmanthus-like aroma of the fruit [ 16].
4: However, more recent studies have determined the characteristic aromatic components of essential oils from the Jinhua district of China, the results of which, using gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O), have demonstrated that -pinene and -bergamotene were the principal contributors to the characteristic aroma of fingered citron oil [ 17].
5: In addition, as a traditional Chinese medicinal plant, fingered citron has usually been employed as a stomachic carminative, asthma expectorant, and anxiolytic [ 1, 9].
6: Although an increasing number of oil bioactivities, including hypotensive and hypolipidemic effects, have been confirmed [ 5], there have been no reports on the effects of isolation procedures on the chemical composition and bioactivities.
0: This work presents two innovative isolation techniques for directly separating the essential oils from the juices of fingered citron.
1: It is important to note that both of the methodologies proposed here do not represent conventional solid-water mixing distillation of essential oils, but a new separation method of the concentrated upper layer of fruit juice.
2: One is a short-time vacuum distillation, and the other is ultrafiltration.
3: The data reported in this work were obtained by comparing the chemical compositions and bioactivities of fingered citron oils using the new methods, with those of the oils obtained by conventional methods such as hydrodistillation and organic solvent extraction.
4: The purpose of this research is to obtain a high-quality, commercially applicable fingered citron oil, that can maintain the pure distinctiveness of fingered citron.
5: It is very likely that improving the quality of fingered citron oil, as well as reducing the processing cost, would significantly improve local agricultural production.
0: Introduction
0: Ticks belong to a group of exclusively blood-feeding ectoparasites (Elmhalli et al.
1: 2009).
2: From the medical point of view, ticks are the second most important group of disease vectors after mosquitoes.
3: The pathogenic agents transmitted by ticks affect the public health and cause economic losses in livestock sector (Svehlova et al.
4: 2014).
5: The Mediterranean region offers suitable environment for a wide range of tick species (Maia et al.
6: 2014).
7: The geographical distribution of ticks has continued to increase over the past three decades (Tabanca et al.
8: 2013; Svehlova et al.
9: 2014).
10: This distribution might be modified by future climate and environmental changes (Jore et al.
11: 2014).
0: The common tick,  Ixodes ricinus (L.) (Acari: Ixodidae), is a triphasic tick that parasitizes a large number of vertebrates including small, medium to large mammals; birds and lizards (Becker et al.
1: 2009).
2: The abundance of  I.  ricinus on different vegetation types in a wooded area of Southern Italy was determined by Dantas-Torres and Otranto ( 2013).
3: They found that the abundance of  I.  ricinus larvae on the ground-level vegetation was generally higher than on the higher vegetation whereas both nymphs and adult stages were more abundant on higher vegetation.
4: The questing behavior of  I.  ricinus consists of climbing the low vegetation to a point from where it can attach to the passing hosts.
5: The host-seeking activity of the castor-bean tick indicated that this tick has a bimodal seasonal activity with a dominant peak during spring whereas a minor peak during autumn (Schulz et al.
6: 2014).
7: The immature stages (larvae and nymphs) feed on woodland birds and small to medium-sized mammals while the adult female feeds on large mammals.
8: Each life stage (larva, nymph, adult) of this tick feeds once on different host for continuous period lasting several days (Heylen et al.
9: 2013).
0: Ixodesricinus is a potential vector of different pathogens.
1: The cattle parasite,  Babesia divergens (the causative agent of humans babesiosis) is transmitted to human by  I.  ricinus (Zintl et al.
2: 2014).
3: Spirochete,  Borreliaburgdorferi sensu lato (the causative agent of Lyme disease) is considered diderm (double-membrane) bacteria with a worldwide distribution.
4: Borrelia burgdorferi is mostly associated with  I.  ricinus complex in Northern Hemisphere.
5: The density of questing  I. ricinus in Northern Norway was determined for the first time by Hvidstena et al.
6: ( 2015).
7: They found that the overall prevalence of nymphs and adult ticks infected by  B. burgdorferi s.l.
8: was 21 and 46%, respectively.
9: The high incidence rate of reported Lyme borreliosis in Bonnoy region can be explained by the high  Borrelia-infection prevalence in ticks (Hvidstena et al.
10: 2015).
11: The encephalitis virus is transmitted to humans by  I.  ricinus nymphs and adults.
12: The infection prevalence of tick-born-encephalitis virus (TBE) was significantly lower in  I.  ricinus nymphs (0.51%) than adults (4.48%) stage (Pettersson et al.
13: 2014).
14: Due to the role of  I.  ricinus tick in the transmitting of many serous pathogens, personal protection against bites of the infected stages of  I.  ricinus is essential.
0: Despite recent advances in tick control strategies, large-scale reduction of tick populations has not been achieved (Tabanca et al.
1: 2013).
2: The synthetic repellents are commonly accepted means of personal protection against tick bites (Iori et al.
3: 2005).
4: However, the use of such commercial synthetic acaricides leads to resistance, residual effects and potentially can harm the environment (Elmhalli et al.
5: 2009).
6: There is a direct need to establish alternative substances for tick control which are safer, available, cheaper and more effective (Frances and Wirtz  2005).
7: Many essential oils (extracted from medicinal plants) considered as promising repellent agents against  I.  ricinus.
8: The repellency of the oils appears to be largely associated with the presence of volatile terpenoid constituents.
0: As a part of our ongoing studies of bioactive constituents from plants commonly used in folk medicine (El-Seedi et al.
1: 2012; Al-Henhen et al.
2: 2014; Boldbaatar et al.
3: 2014) with potential use in chemical ecology research, we here present results from 11 medicinal and culinary plants originating from Egypt.
4: We isolated the essential oils and evaluated their bioactivity against the common tick  I.  ricinus and identified the main chemical constituents of these essential oils using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS).
0: Background
0: Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive cocci often associated with gastroenteritis acquired from contaminated foods such as milk [ 1] and shrimp.
1: The occurrence of multidrug-resistant bacteria in food is a worldwide concern [ 2], and  S. aureus drug-resistant to beta-lactams has been isolated from dairy products [ 1] and shrimp [ 3].
0: Some factors act for selecting drug-resistant bacteria pathogens, such as inappropriate use of antibiotics, and/or the inadequate disposal of antimicrobial drugs in the environment [ 4,  5].
1: Thus, the inappropriate use of antibiotics in aquaculture [ 6,  7] and livestock [ 8] has contributed to the selection of resistant microbial species, and, consequently, increased food contamination level of animal origin and derivatives.
0: As an alternative to mitigate the occurrence of multidrug-resistant bacteria, the study of antimicrobial compounds in phanerogams has been proposed [ 9].
1: In this context, the plants of genus  Plectranthus - 3000 recognized species, spread along countries in Africa, South America, Asia and Australia  are widely recognized in folk and popular medicine, being employed in digestive treatments as well as in infectious, inflammatory and respiratory problems [ 10,  11].
2: Species of  Plectrantus [ 12,  13], including  P. amboinicus [ 14], has been studied due to its pharmacological properties in order to validate its popular use.
0: Bioactivity of  P. amboinicus is related to the occurrence of 76 volatiles and 30 non-volatile compounds belonging to different classes of phytochemicals (monoterpenoids, diterpenoids, triterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, phenolics, flavonoids, esters, alcohols and aldehydes) [ 15].
1: Studies about the pharmacological activities of  P. amboinicus are conducted from extracts or essential oil, i.e., complex volatile compounds, synthesized naturally in different plant parts during the process of secondary metabolism with great potential in the field of biomedicine [ 16].
2: In this sense,  P. amboinicus crude essential oils could be used as a tool for the developing novel and more efficacious antimicrobial agents against  S. epidermidis and  Candida species [ 17] .
0: The susceptibility of methicillin-resistant  S. aureus (MRSA) clinical isolates to extracts of  P. amboinicus has been reported [ 18], however, studies about the action of this oil and its major component against planktonic and biofilm of drug-resistant  S. aureus from food are still incipient.
0: Thus, this study aims to determine the susceptibility of drug-resistant  S. aureus strains isolated from milk and shrimp to  P. amboinicus essential oil (PAEO) and its major component - carvacrol.

1: Introduction
0: According to the World Health Organization (WHO), noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) will be responsible for more than three-quarters of all deaths in 2030, among which cardiovascular diseases (CVD) represent a major risk.
1: The mortality rate by CVD should rise from 17.1 million in 2004 to 23.4 million in 2030.
2: The epidemiological data show that lifestyle and dietary habits are the main factors of the high prevalence of hypertension [ 1].
0: Conventional medicines used in the treatment of CVD have numerous collateral effects [ 2], and they are expensive [ 3].
1: Thus, there is a requirement for a safer, cheaper, and more powerful alternative.
2: The professional community has increasingly accepted natural medicine, due to advances in understanding the mechanisms by which plants positively influence health and quality of life [ 4,  5].
0: Pharmaceutical studies have shown that natural products represent an extremely valuable source for the production of new chemical products and treatment of untreated diseases [ 6 8].
1: Natural products are present in diverse parts of plants, produced through their metabolism, and their pharmacological potential has been confirmed in scientific studies; moreover, they are easily extracted and are economically viable [ 9]; hence, essential oils have a large tradition in popular medicine [ 10].
0: Among the various aromatic plants, present in our region, with powerful pharmaceutical properties, the species  Protium heptaphyllum (Aubl.)
1: Marchand is highlighted due to its wide distribution in our community, frequently found in core markets, used in folk medicine and extensive potential therapeutic applications.
0: P. heptaphyllum, belonging to the Burseraceae family, is a tree present almost all over Brazil, especially in damp or dry sandy soil areas; it is evergreen or semideciduous and aromatic, with a height of 10 m to 20 m and stem of 40 cm to 60 cm in diameter [ 11].
1: It is found mainly in the Amazon region and in some northeastern states, such as Bahia, Ceara, and Piaui, and other countries of South America (Colombia, Paraguay, Suriname, and Venezuela).
2: From its trunk exudes an oily resin called  Almecega or  Breu-branco, which hardens in contact with air; this exudate has a greenish-white coloration and a pleasant aroma and is rich in essential oils [ 11,  12].
0: Almecega presents several therapeutic indications such as anti-inflammatory, contraceptive, antineoplastic, cicatrizing, expectorant, antimicrobial, and antifungal indications [ 13].
1: It is also used by the indigenous Brazilians as a nasal decongestant [ 10, 1417] for being present in various parts of the plants produced through its secondary metabolism; its pharmacological potential has been reported in some scientific studies; because they are easy to extract and are economically viable, essential oils have assumed a prominent role in research on natural products; however, still few studies investigate their cardiovascular effects, being the first time reported in the species under study.
0: The emergence of drug resistant strains of pathogens, the increase in the immunocompromised population, and the limitations of the available antibiotics/drugs have motivated people to use complementary and alternative therapies, including the use of essential oils [ 18].
0: The essential oil obtained from the resin of Almecega has been proven to have anti-inflammatory, antitumor, antioxidant, antimicrobial, and cytotoxic actions against  Artemia salina [ 15].
1: In this context,  P. heptaphyllum has become a potential ally, since many pharmacological studies have shown its positive effects in the treatment of various diseases coupled with the fact that there are no studies that prove the action of this essential oil from  P. heptaphyllum (EOPh) in contraction of vascular smooth muscle.
0: Introduction
0: Salinity as abiotic stress is a permanent major threat to the agriculture industry worldwide and usually associated with morphological (e.g., reduced growth and productivity), physiological (e.g., reduction of gas exchange parameters and homeostasis), and biochemical (e.g., oxidative stress with elevated reactive oxygen species content) responses (Nazar et al.,  2011; Gupta and Huang,  2014; Khan et al.,  2014; Acosta-Motos et al.,  2017; Quan et al.,  2017).
1: The accumulation of Na + and Cl  during saline conditions is a detrimental factor that may lead to ion imbalance, ion toxicity, and physiological disorder (Gupta and Huang,  2014).
2: Several approaches had been adopted to control salinity adverse effects on plants including breeding programs and utilization of transgenic plants (Bhatnagar-Mathur et al.,  2008), chemical priming (Savvides et al.,  2016), microorganisms (Jha et al.,  2011), and salicylic acid (Fayez and Bazaid,  2014).
0: Salicylic acid (SA) plays a crucial role in plant development, disease resistance, stress tolerance, and fruit yield (Horvath et al.,  2007; Rivas-San Vicente and Plasencia,  2011; Liu et al.,  2015).
1: Several investigations indicated that salicylic acid influences gas exchange parameters and water composition (Stevens et al.,  2006), increases phenolics accumulation (Kovacik et al.,  2009), enhances the oxidative stress tolerance (Li et al.,  2014), and may alleviate osmotic stress (Nazar et al.,  2011).
2: SA effects are largely dependent on genetic and environmental factors (Idrees et al.,  2010) as well as on method and dose of application (Horvath et al.,  2007).
3: Some investigations indicated that plant secondary metabolites might be influenced by SA treatments such as the essential oils in  Ocimum basilicum L. (Mirzajani et al.,  2015), oleoresins in  Pinus (Rodrigues and Fett-Neto,  2009), and triterpenes in  Nigella (Elyasi et al.,  2016).
0: Rosmarinus officinallis L. (Lamiaceae), commercially known as rosemary, is produced in the Mediterranean region such as in Egypt (Domokos et al.,  1997; Elansary and Mahmoud,  2015).
1: Rosemary leaves are consumed fresh or dried and might be used for essential oils production as well as for cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries (Elansary et al.,  2015; Habtemariam,  2016).
2: Previous investigations have shown that rosemary has antioxidant, antibacterial and anticancer activities (Bozin et al.,  2007; Elansary and Mahmoud,  2015).
3: However, there is insufficient information on rosemary bioactivity and its anti-oxidative mechanisms during salt stress and SA treatments.
4: Therefore, the main objective of this study was to investigate the effect of exogenous SA treatment on rosemary performance under saline conditions.
5: Several important traits of rosemary such as morphological (e.g., plant heights, branches number, and fresh and dry weights), physiological (essential oil ratio and constitutes, phenolics, carbohydrates, chlorophyll, proline, and Na + and Cl  of leaves), biochemical (antioxidant mechanisms) and genetic (expression of antioxidants genes and genes conferring tolerance to salinity) markers have been investigated in this study.
6: Furthermore, the inhibitory activities against wide spectrum bacteria were investigated as an economic application.

0: The current trend in natural product research involves identifying and validating plant derived substances used ethno-medicinally in the management of various diseases.
1: Incidentally, essential oils obtained from plant materials have been evaluated extensively for biological activities with promising results.
2: Thus many compounds have been isolated from essential oils with proven potency and providing pharmacological basis for ethno-medicinal uses of several plants.
3: Curcuma longa, commonly known as turmeric is a tropical herb, native to southern Asia and some parts of Africa.
4: The aromatic yellow powder from its mature rhizomes is extensively used for imparting colour and flavor to food  [1],  [2].
5: Curcuma spp.
6: is used worldwide for its antioxidant, antispasmodic, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties  [3],  [4].
7: In Southwest Nigeria, the plant especially the rhizome is locally called  Ata ile pupa[5].
8: The rhizome of the plant is normally boiled and sipped but it is also added to other herbal agents to manage several ailments.
9: Its folkloric uses includes the treatment of malaria, jaundice, gastric ulcer, skin diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, hypertension, cold and flu symptoms, convulsions and emotional disorders  [6],  [7].
0: Several pharmacological properties have been reported for curcumin, a major component of the alcohol extract of  C. longa and  C. domestica rhizomes  [8].
1: The essential oil of  C. longa has been reported to contain monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, alcohols and ketones  [9],  [3],  [10].
2: Terpinolene and -phellandrene have been identified as the predominant constituents of leaf oil of a Nigerian grown  C. longa[11], while  [12] reported a different chemotype -tumerone from Southwest Nigeria.
3: The main focus of previous research study was on the anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anti-diabetic and other nutritional properties of the plant as well as on curcumin, ethanolic extract of the rhizome.
4: However, there has been no report on the central nervous system effects of the plant, this study therefore aimed at evaluating the  in-vivo neuropharmacological activity, determine the acute toxicity profile and investigate the chemical composition of the essential oil of the studied species since there were different chemotypes of the Nigerian  C longa.
5: Therefore this study reveals the contribution of the plants volatile component to its central nervous system activities, toxicological profile and provides rationale for its ethnomedicinal uses.

0: Fennel (Arpabodiyon, local Tajik name),  Foeniculum vulgare Miller, an important member of the Apiaceae, is widely used for flavouring foods and beverages due to its pleasant spicy aroma [ 1, 2].
1: In traditional medicine, the plant and its essential oil have been extensively used as carminative, digestive, galactogogue and diuretic and to treat respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders [ 1].
2: It is also used as a constituent in cosmetic and pharmaceutical products [ 3].
3: The essential oil of  F. vulgare, in particular anethole, exhibits antispasmodic, carminative, anti-inflammatory, estrogenic and anti-microbial activities [ 4].
4: In vitro, fennel oil possesses antioxidant [ 5, 6], antimicrobial [ 7], insecticidal [ 8], antithrombotic [ 9] and hepatoprotective activities [ 2].
5: Furthermore, the essential oil of fennel exhibits in vitro anticancer activity [ 10, 11, 12].
6: The in vitro cytotoxic, genotoxic, and apoptotic activities of estragole were suspected to induce hepatic tumors in susceptible strains of mice [ 10].
0: Anethole is toxic in high concentrations [ 4].
1: Because of their lipophilic properties, the secondary metabolites of essential oils are able to penetrate cytoplasmic membranes by free diffusion.
2: This process can affect membrane fluidity and permeability, transport, ion equilibrium and membrane potential [ 13], leading to cell death by apoptosis and necrosis [ 11].
0: The essential oil of fennel is rich in secondary metabolites, which carry reactive substituents (among them carbonyl groups) in their ring structures or side chains.
1: Aldehydes are generally long-lived and electrophilic compounds, they can react with molecular targets which carry free amino groups, such as of amino acid residues in proteins or of nucleotides in DNA to form Schiffs bases [ 14].
2: Aldehyde-containing essential oils often exhibit cytotoxicity [ 15, 16] by reacting with cellular nucleophiles, including proteins and nucleic acids [ 13, 17].
0: The chemical composition of the essential oil of  F. vulgare from different geographical locations has been extensively studied [ 6, 18, 19, 20].
1: According to these studies, the major components of fennel oil are  trans-anethole, estragole, fenchone, and limonene depending on the chemotype [ 21, 22, 23].
2: The aim of the present study was to investigate the chemical composition of the essential oil of fennel growing in Tajikistan (Central Asia) and to explore cytotoxic activity against different human cancer cell lines.
3: The biological activity and chemical composition of  F. vulgare oil from Tajikistan have not been previously reported.

0: Basil ( Ocimum basilicum L.) is an annual herb growing in several regions around the world.
1: The genus  Ocimum consists of more than 150 species whereof basil is cultivated in many countries as a major essential oil crop [ 1].
2: The species most commonly used as spices and medicinal herbs are  O. basilicum L.,  O. americanum L. (syn.
3: O. canum Sims.
4: ),  O. gratissimum L.,  O. kilimandscharicum Guerke,  O. tenuiflorum L. (syn.
5: O. sanctum L.), and  O. africanum Lour.
6: (syn.
7: O.   citriodorum Vis.
8: ), that is a hybrid of  O. basilicum and  O. americanum [ 2].
9: The taxonomy of the genus  Ocimum is very complicated due to the occurrence of interspecific hybridization, polyploidy, aneuploidy, the existence of numerous botanical varieties, and chemotypes, as well as the many synonymous names [ 3, 4, 5].
10: Plants of the species  O. basilicum have square stems, fragrant opposite leaves, and whorled flowers on spiked inflorescences [ 6].
11: O. basilicum L. is widely used in the culinary arts and in the food processing industry [ 7].
12: Traditionally, it has been used as medicinal plant for the treatment of headaches, coughs, diarrhea, constipation, warts, worms, and kidney malfunction [ 8].
13: A plethora of biological activities have been attributed to basil essential oils like antimicrobial, insecticidal, and recently was found to exhibit in vivo anti-malarial activity [ 9].
14: In addition, extracts from leaves and flowers can be used as aroma additives in food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industry [ 10].
15: Economical data clearly indicate the commercial importance of basil essential oil, since the world production is estimated to 1,200,000  [ 8].
16: Basil essential oils contain a broad array of chemical compounds depending on variations in chemotypes, flower, and leaf colours, aroma and especially the origin of the plant [ 7].
17: The essential oil constituents vary among sweet basil cultivars, with linalool, methyl chavicol, eugenol, 1,8-cineole, geranial, neral, methyl cinnamate recognized as main components [ 11, 12, 13].
18: Several scientists have classified basil to different chemotypes according to the main components of the essential oil.
19: Thereby, Marotti et al.
20: (1996) divided essential oil from Italian basil varieties to three chemotypes linalool, linalool-methyl chavicol, and linalool-eugenol [ 14].
21: According to the plant origin, basils are grouped to European chemotype that has linalool and methyl chavicol as main components and Tropical chemotype having methyl chavicol as a main compound [ 15].
22: Concerning the cultivation of basil, the plants can be harvested one to three times during cropping season depending on the climate [ 16].
23: Generally, basil is harvested for the leaves that are sold fresh or dried.
24: In the cases that basil is cultivated for dried leaves and extraction of essential oil, the plants are cut just prior the appearance of the flowers [ 17].
25: Scientific data concerning how harvest and number of harvests during the cultivation of aromatic plants affect essential oil quality and composition are lacking either in field or greenhouse conditions.
26: To the best of our knowledge, so far Carlo et al.
27: (2013) studied the effect of cut number in quality traits of sweet basil [ 18].
28: Also Zheljazkof et al.
29: (2008) studied the effect of harvests in  O. basilicum L. (cvs.
30: German and Mesten) and  O. sanctum L. (syn.
31: O. tenuiflorum L.) (cv.
32: Local) cultivated in Mississippi [ 9].
33: Taking into account that geographic position and the environmental characteristics of the habitat should be taken as factors affecting the chemical composition of the essential oils [ 19], the current study is the first including total chemical analysis of the essential oils from five basil varieties cultivated and harvested in the field and greenhouse in the island of Kefalonia, (Greece).
34: The aim of our study is the chemical analysis of essential oils from the five varieties of basil considering also the cultivation site as well as how the ability of the plant to rejuvenate after successive cuttings during growing cycle, affects the obtained essential oil yield and composition.
35: In order to simulate the natural growing conditions, successive cuttings were performed in every variety just before flowering stage, as done practically from aromatic plants growers.
36: Moreover the cluster analysis of all basil varieties for greenhouse and field samples is given.

1: Introduction
0: Sage (also known as garden sage, common sage, or culinary sage;  Salvia officinalis L., Lamiaceae) is a popular culinary and medicinal herb, native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean, but now cultivated worldwide.
1: The plant has been used since ancient times for various human ailments.
2: For example, in England, a decoction of sage leaves with wine was gargled to relieve toothache [ 1]; in Germany, sage was used orally for gastrointestinal problems and excessive perspiration, and was used topically for inflammation of the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat [ 2]; the Cherokee Native Americans have used an infusion of the plant to treat colds and coughs, and as an antidiarrheal [ 3].
3: Commercial sage oil is generally characterized by thujones, with -thujone usually predominating (1843%) over -thujone (38.5%), camphor (4.524.5%), 1,8-cineole (5.513%), -humulene (012%), -pinene (16.5%), camphene (1.57%), and bornyl acetate (2.5% maximum) [ 2].
0: Caution should be exercised in using sage essential oil.
1: The oil contains large concentrations of -thujone, which was thought to have been the hallucinogenic constituent of absinthe and the cause of absinthism.
2: This, however, has been shown to be false [ 4].
3: Nevertheless, high doses of -thujone causes convulsions by way of blocking -aminobutyric acid (GABA)-gated chloride channels [ 5, 6], and chronic exposure can lead to neurotoxicity [ 7, 8] and carcinogenicity [ 9].
4: Use of the herb itself is safe, however; it has been estimated that between 2 and 20 cups of sage tea would be required to reach the acceptable daily intake of thujone [ 10].
5: Additionally, thujone has shown a low affinity for cannabinoid receptors, but failed to show cannabinoid receptor agonism [ 11].
6: -Thujone has also been shown to reduce 5-HT 3 (ligand-gated ion channel serotonin) receptor activity [ 12].
7: In this work, we have characterized two commercial sage essential oils as well as an essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation of sage leaves grown in Mexico.
8: In addition, a cluster analysis has been carried out to place the different chemotypes of sage oil in perspective.

0: The family Chloranthaceae includes plants grouped in four genera:  Sarcandra Gardner,  Chloranthus Sw.,  Ascarina J.R. Forst.
1: and G.
2: Forst., and  Hedyosmum Sw.
3: The genus  Hedyosmum comprises 40 species of shrubs and small trees distributed from Mexico, throughout Central America to Bolivia, east of the Guianas and the Antilles [ 1].
4: The name  Hedyosmum comes from the Greek pleasant fragrance and alludes to one of the most remarkable characteristics of these plants, the pleasant aromatic smell coming from all its parts [ 1, 2].
5: According to Todzia [ 1], different  Hedyosmum species have been popularly used all around Central and South America for different purposes:  H. scabrum (Ruiz & Pav.)
6: Solms for conception stimulation;  H. scabrum and  H. scaberrimun Standl.
7: as stomach pain relievers;  H. sprucei Solms for snake bites;  H. cumbalense H. Karst.
8: as a stimulant; and  H. racemosum (Ruiz & Pav.)
9: G. Don as a treatment to joint pain.
10: The essential oil composition from some species of this genus ( H. sprucei,  H. arborescens Sw.,  H. scabrum,  H. colombianum Cuatrec.,  H. angustifolium (Ruiz & Pav.)
11: Solms,  H. mexicanum C.
12: Cordem.,  H. bonplandianum Mart., and  H. costaricense C.E.
13: Wood ex W.C. Burger) have previously been described [ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], as well as their antioxidant and cytotoxic properties [ 3, 4].
0: Hedyosmum brasiliense Mart.
1: ex Miq., popularly known as cha de bugre, cidreira, or cidrao, is a dioecious shrub distributed throughout central and southern Brazilian regions and western Paraguay [ 9, 10].
2: Its leaves have been used in folk medicine to treat migraine, ovarium dysfunction, foot fungi, rheumatism, stomach pain, and as a diuretic [ 1, 2].
3: Chemical and pharmacological studies with the aerial parts of  H. brasiliense indicated analgesic, anxiolytic, antidepressive, and aphrodisiac effects for the crude extracts and for some isolated sesquiterpene lactones [ 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16].
4: There are also some reports on the antimicrobial activity for the ethanol extract [ 17] and the essential oils [ 18, 19], however none of them could attribute the observed bioactivity to a specific compound.
5: The essential oil presented as major compounds specimen sabinene, (Z)--guaiene and pinocarvone, for a Sao Paulo State [ 18], and pinocarvone, curzerene and carotol, for one from Santa Catarina State [ 19].
6: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the chemical composition and biological activities of  H. brasiliense flower essential oils.
7: In addition, this is also the first time that the antioxidant activity is described for this species.
8: Therefore, this work aims to investigate the chemical composition of the essential oils from  H. brasiliense male and female flowers and leaves collected at Ilha do Cardoso (Sao Paulo, Brazil) and to compare their antifungal and antioxidant activities, as well as to identify the main antifungal constituents in the essential oils.

1: Introduction
0: Even Brazil, occupying a highlighting position between the biggest worlds producers, has a productivity that is considered low when compared to other producer countries.
1: In the state of Tocantins, it is observed expressive increases of planted areas and of productivity on maize culture, which have been higher than the national mean in the last years.
2: These indicators make the state of Tocantins one of the greatest producers of the North region [ 1], and one of the potential producers of grains of Brazil in a near future [ 2].
0: Among the factors that affect the productivity and the quality of the grain, there are the diseases.
1: Recent studies show an increase on the frequency of the fungus  Curvularia lunata (Wakker) provoking diseases in maize cultivars in China [ 3].
2: In maize plantations in Brazil, there are few records of the  Curvularia Leaf Spot in scientific literature.
3: In the state of Tocantins there is an observed marked increase on the incidence of this disease for many years [ 4].
4: In a disease survey on Tocantins realized by [ 5], the  Curvularia Leaf Spot was noted together with helmintosporiosis ( H. turcicum) as more incident.
0: Nowadays, alternatives for reduction of the use of pesticides are searched, and some works have already been realized aiming at identifying new bioproducts based on medicinal plants with antimicrobial action [ 6].
1: Some works have already showed that the addition of essential oils in specific concentrations on the culture environments with phytopathogenic fungi is efficient in the inhibition of development of these organisms [ 7, 8, 9, 10].
0: Considering the lack of works developed for the control of  Curvularia Leaf Spot in the state of Tocantins and in Brazil, studies are necessary in pursuing the disease management.
1: The objective of the present work was to evaluate the fungitoxicity of the essential oil of  C. citratus, commonly known as lemongrass, upon the phytopathogen  C. lunata, and also to verify its efficiency on the preventive and curative control of  Curvularia Leaf Spot on maize.
0: The experiments were performed at the Phytopathology Laboratory of the Gurupi Campus, Federal University of Tocantins (UFT), in the state of Tocantins, Brazil.
1: C. lunata was initially isolated from the maize leaves derived from the experimental field of UFT with the diseases symptoms, and put in a PDA (Potato, Dextrose, Agar) culture environment.

1: Introduction
0: New preferences for a minimum of processed food and recent changes in consumers concern about synthetic preservatives [ 1] have led to an increase in the use of natural preservatives in foods [ 2].
0: Plant extracts have been employed by humans for thousands of years in traditional medicine.
1: The Lamiaceae family contains important aromatic plants used in traditional and modern medicine and in the food and pharmaceutical industries.
2: Rosemary, thyme, oregano, and sage are the most popular plants in Spanish traditional remedies and are often used for the treatment of gastritis, infections, dermatitis, bronchitis, and inflammation.
3: Particularly, rosemary and sage have been extensively studied for their antioxidative and antimicrobial activity.
4: The vegetation of Southeast Spain (Murcia) is rich in aromatic plants, and the province of Murcia is a major producer and processor of medicinal herbs [ 3].
5: Rosemary and thyme are mostly exploited for the extraction of essential oils (EOs).
6: Among the >3000 essential oils known, about 300 are of importance for the pharmaceutical, agronomic, and food industries.
0: EOs are volatile liquids, or semi-liquids, extracted from plants, usually by steam distillation [ 4].
1: They are limpid and rarely coloured, are soluble in organic solvents with a lower density than that of water, and are lipid soluble.
2: They can be synthesized by all plant organs (flowers, leaves, stems, twigs, seeds, fruits, roots, wood, or bark) and are stored in secretory cells, cavities, canals, epidermic cells or glandular trichomes.
3: EOs are complex mixtures of sesquiterpene and monoterpene hydrocarbons and alcohols, ketones, and aldehydes (their oxygenated derivatives).
4: Essential oils may also encompass other chemical families like fatty acids, oxides, and sulphur derivatives [ 5].
0: EOs are of scientific and popular interest because (a) they may act synergistically with other techniques of preservation, (b) they are generally recognized as safe, and (c) they show antioxidant, antibacterial, antidiabetic, antimutagenic, non-toxigenic, and antimycotic properties which are promising for their use as bioactive compounds in different foods [ 6].
0: The main components of common essential oils can be classified into two structural families with respect to hydrocarbon skeleton: terpenoids, formed by the combination of two (monoterpene), three (sesquiterpene) or four (diterpene) isoprene units, and phenylpropanoids.
1: Both terpenoid and phenylpropanoid families comprise phenolic compounds, sometimes identified as principal components of several EOs.
0: Plants synthesize essential oils for a variety of purposes, including protection of the plant against fungi and bacteria, allelopathic activity, defence against insects (terpenoids are known to repel animals and insects) and attraction of pollinators and dispersal agents to favour the dispersion of seeds and pollens (the aromas and scents of the plants are responsible for the attraction of insects by the essential oils, characterized by volatility and a strong odour).
1: Essential oils can protect plants against viruses, bacteria, fungi, insects, and herbivores [ 7].
2: The major activities of essential oils are antimicrobial, sedative, anti-inflammatory, bactericidal, antiviral, antifungal (fungicidal), and preservative for foods.
0: There is also a growing interest in plant EOs as natural alternatives to synthetic additives.
1: This review describes the biological activities of EOs from the Lamiaceae family, primarily the antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of essential oils and the structureactivity relationships and mechanisms of action of their active components.
2: Finally, an overview will be provided of other preventive and therapeutic properties of EOs, such as anti-angiogenic and anti-tumour properties.

0: Commiphora gileadensis (L.) C. Chr.
1: (syn.
2: C. opobalsamum (L.) Engl.)
3: is an medium-sized aromatic shrub native to the Red Sea area, including Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Egypt, and Kenya [ 1].
4: In 1763, the renowned scholar and botanist Carl Linnaeus received a specimen collected in Yemen from his student Peter Forsskal, and identified it as the Biblical Balm of Gilead [ 2, 3, 4].
5: Today, there is widespread agreement among scholars that  C. gileadensis is one of the myrrh species of the Burseraceae and the source of the legendary Balm of Judea (Balsam) perfume.
0: C. gileadensis is also known in Hebrew as apharsemon (5).
1: The plant is indigenous to the land of Israel and emits a thick aromatic sap, from which the renowned perfume was made.
2: Various historical sources point out that apharsemon was cultivated intensively in the Jordan Valley and Ein Gedi, in the western Dead Sea basin as a crop, and its perfume was admired and traded at a high price during Biblical times, during the time of the Second Jewish Temple, and during the Roman and Byzantine eras [ 5, 6, 7].
3: Archeological excavations around the Ein Gedi oasis in Israel, on the north-west shore of the Dead Sea, unraveled furnace-like structures, jars, and other objects dating from the sixth century B.C.E.
4: that were comparable with those found in perfume-making workshops.
5: This supports the historical references.
6: In the 1990s,  C. gileadensis was reintroduced to Israel and is currently cultivated in Ein Gedi, near the Dead Sea [ 8], renewing a long lost part of Jewish history in the land of Israel.
0: C. gileadensis has been used historically to treat a wide array of ailments [ 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], and is used today in the traditional medicine practices of some cultures in the Middle East.
1: In Yemen and Oman, the bark exudate is used externally to treat skin disorders such as burns, wounds, and infections [ 6, 14, 15].
2: Among the Arab populations in the Middle East, a decoction of the aerial parts of the plant is administered as a pain reliever, a diuretic, and a laxative [ 16, 17].
3: In 2010, Iluz et al.
4: [ 6] investigated the medicinal properties of  C. gileadensis and demonstrated that its sap had an inhibitory effect against  Bacillus cereus and was capable of blocking lectins of  Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
5: This confirms the historical sources that indicated the antiseptic properties of the balsams sap.
6: In 2012, Amiel et al.
7: [ 18] further supported this finding by showing that ( E)-caryophyllene was a key component in  C. gileadensis essential oil, that the balsams stem extracts acted against cancerous tumor cells, and had apoptosis-inducing properties that acted selectively, eradicating tumor cells, but not healthy cells.
0: Although  C. gileadensis has been an important medicinal plant throughout history, information about the essential oil composition of wild  C. gileadensis is lacking.
1: Therefore, in this work, the essential oil compositions attained from the stem bark, leaves, and fruits of wild  C. gileadensis collected in Ein Gedi, Israel were determined and compared to the composition of commercially used  C. gileadensis oil.
2: In addition, to further characterize the essential oils, the enantiomeric distributions of the monoterpenoids in  C. gileadensis essential oils were determined.

1: Introduction
0: Aromatic and medicinal plants are important sources of secondary metabolites, which have a wide range of applications in control of plant and human diseases, cosmetics, as well as in the pharmaceutical industry [ 1].
1: In the plant kingdom, family Asteraceae is endowed with essential oil-yielding plants, and among these plants, the genus  Artemisia occupies top position for its bio-prospection.
2: The genus consists of small herbs and shrubs, found in northern temperate regions and comprises of about 500 species from South Asia, North America and European countries [ 2].
3: Species of the genus are called by the common names mugwort, wormwood and sagebrush.
4: Due to presence of terpenoids and sesquiterpene lactones, most of the species possess strong aromas and bitter tastes, which discourage herbivory, and may have had a selective advantage [ 3].
5: These species have wide and varied applications in plant and human disease control and in the pharmaceutical industry.
6: There are several species of  Artemisia that have been investigated as antimicrobial, antioxidant, cytotoxic, insecticidal, repellent and anticonvulsant agents [ 4, 5].
7: Although a review on the genus  Artemisia was published by Abad et al.
8: [ 2] on the chemical composition, ethanopharmacological and biocidal activity of essential oils, they took the data from 20002011, and mainly focused on human pathogens.
9: Recently, another review compiled by Al-Snafi [ 6], which focused only on  A. campestris, revealed several pharmacological activities, such as antimicrobial, antioxidant, cytotoxic, insecticidal, antivenomous, and many other pharmacological effects.
10: In this review, we have compiled the data from 20122017 on chemical composition, antimicrobial, insecticidal and antioxidant activities of  Artemisia species.
11: Regarding antimicrobial and insecticidal activities of essential oils, here, we have mainly focused on pathogens and pests of plants and, since Abad et al.
12: [ 2] did not describe earlier literature on antimicrobial and insecticidal activities of  Artemisia oils on same aspects and also antioxidant activity, so in this review we have also covered the literature from 2000 onwards on these aspects.
0: Background
0: Various herb species have been used worldwide in prevention and treatment of diseases for many centuries.
1: Today, several drugs have been developed from plants that are active against many common diseases [ 1].
2: Among the aromatic plants belonging to the  Lamiaceae family,  Rosmarinus officinalis, commonly known as Rosemary, is a flavoured herb which is native to the Mediterranean region and grows in various countries in the world [ 2].
3: The ROEO is a mixture of several major and minor compounds [ 3].
4: Debersac et al.
5: [ 4] showed that 1,8-cineole is the major component of Rosemary essential oil, whereas, in other studies -pinene was the main component, followed by 1,8-cineole, camphene, -myrcene, borneol and camphor [ 5].
6: Essential oils represent an alternative green to be used in the cosmetic, pharmaceutical, agricultural and food fields while substituting chemical treatments.
7: Biological activities of essential oils from various plants, including Rosemary, have been attributed to the presence of specific chemical compounds [ 6].
8: Several studies have demonstrated the antimicrobial [ 7], antiproliferative [ 8], anti-inflammatory [ 9] and antioxidant [ 10] activities of the ROEO.
9: The oil of Rosemary is used as a biological preservative of food products [ 11] due to its antioxidant and antimicrobial properties [ 12].
0: Bacteria, during development, can be present in planktonic or sessile forms known as biofilm [ 13].
1: Biofilm is a microbial structure that causes many problems in medical field, in food industry and even to the environment.
2: Thus, biofilm could cause many public health problems.
3: Indeed, nearly 80% of chronic bacterial infections are associated with the presence of biofilm [ 14].
4: In addition, biofilms contaminate the majority of medical or prosthetic devices such as vascular prosthesis [ 15], urinary catheters [ 16], joint prostheses, pacemakers [ 17], contact lens [ 18] and dental plates [ 19].
5: As the antibiotic treatment is most effective against microbial infections, bacterial biofilms are highly resistant to antibiotics posing a public health problem.
6: Indeed, concentrations of antibiotics needed to inhibit bacteria in biofilms may be greater than a thousand times that required to inhibit the same planktonic bacteria [ 20].
7: So, it is necessary to find alternatives to fight against biofilm problems.
8: In addition, biofilms cause a problem in many food industries.
9: They contaminate the surfaces in contact with food while causing an alteration of the organoleptic quality of food products [ 21].
10: It has been previously demonstrated that essential oils are able to penetrate and cause the destruction of microbial biofilms [ 22].
11: Few studies have shown the anti-biofilm activity of ROEO [ 23,  24].
12: However, all of these studies did not use  Staphylococcus epidermidis, which is the major cause of catheter infections, as a model for anti-biofilm studies.
0: In many studies, antitumor activity has been reported for essential oils against several tumor cell lines.
1: In fact, in-vitro anticancer activity of the essential oil isolated from the leaf of  Machilus mushaensis from Taiwan was analyzed and the oil exhibited cytotoxic activity against human oral, liver, lung, colon, melanoma, and leukemic cancer cells [ 25].
2: Indeed, other researchers evaluated the anticancer activity of the essential oil of  Plectranthus amboinicus (Lour) and this investigation exhibited the potent chemotherapeutic/chemopreventive effect of  P. amboinicus (Lour) essential oil over lung metastasis [ 26].
0: In other studies, the oils of  Eucalyptus torquata stems exhibited cytotoxic activities on MCF-7 cells [ 27].
1: Huang et al.
2: [ 28] have investigated the effect of two volatile oils prepared by steam distillation (SD) and supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) of  Centipeda minima, a Chinese herb used in the treatment of various diseases including cancer.
3: They found that SFE oil displayed potent anti-angiogenic activity in a zebrafish model [ 28].
0: Taking all together, valorization of essential oils by the study of their original biological activities is of great interest.
1: In this context, the aim of this study was to characterize the chemical composition of Tunisian ROEO, to evaluate its antibacterial, anti-biofilm activities and anticancer properties.
0: Introduction
0: Mosquitoes are responsible for a number of human health problems causing illness and death throughout the world in both children and adults.
1: They are vector for many diseases such as malaria, filariasis, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, chikungunya and west Nile virus infection in tropical and subtropical countries ( Anupam et al.
2: 2012).
3: Malaria is a deadly disease and globally about 3.3 billion peoples are at the risk of it.
4: About 198 million cases of malaria and 0.58 million deaths occurred globally in 2013 ( WHO 2014).
5: Of the six malarial vector species,  Anopheles stephensi is the main mosquito vector responsible for malaria in urban areas of India ( Senthilkumar et al.
6: 2009).
7: Dengue fever is caused by mosquito vector species,  Ades aegypti in its epidemic areas affecting millions of people and thousands of deaths per year all over the world ( Service 1996).
8: Similarly,  Culex quinquefasciatus is a vector for lymphatic filariasis, commonly known as elephantiasis, in India.
9: Lymphatic filariasis is caused by the worms  Wuchereria bancrofti,  Brugia malayi and  Br.
10: timori of which, first is found to be more endemic in Indian subcontinent.
11: According to  WHO (2009) more than 1.3 billion people spread over 72 different countries worldwide are threatened by it.
12: Collectively, these mosquito mediated diseases are responsible for long term suffering, morbidity and high socio economic burden on society ( Ramaiah et al.
13: 2000,  Intirach et al.
14: 2012).
0: Efficient control of these diseases would require a two-pronged strategy, (i) prompt treatment with effective medicines and (ii) vector control based prevention strategies.
1: Injudicious use of medicines, particularly antimalarial drugs, has resulted in development of resistance by the malarial parasite and enhanced casualties in endemic areas ( Intirach et al.
2: 2012).
3: Mosquito management therefore, offers a better and practical alternative for controlling diseases mediated by them.
4: Mosquito adulticides, causing temporary reduction in population are good but do not offer a lasting solution.
5: Mosquito larvae being delicate, less mobile and more concentrated in their natural habitat offer a much simpler and efficient point of intervention and control ( Rutledge et al.
6: 2003,  Dharmagadda et al.
7: 2005).
8: However, there are reports of development of resistance and behavior changes in adult mosquitoes and larvae towards these chemicals ( Mittal et al.
9: 2004,  WHO 2006).
10: Moreover, they adversely affect the environment, causing soil, air, water pollution and harm the beneficial non target organisms ( Dharmagadda et al.
11: 2005).
12: Plant extract including essential oils or insecticides from botanical origin are attractive alternatives because they contain high amount of various bioactive compounds, many of which are selective and have little or no harmful effects on non-target organisms and environment ( Rutledge et al.
13: 2003,  Dharmagadda et al.
14: 2005).
15: Essential oil is natural volatile substances found in many plants.
16: Essential oils isolated from plant are generally a mixture of many constituents, primarily biologically active monoterpenes ( Govindrajan 2010).
17: Traditionally, they have been used for flavor enhancement in food, odorants in fragrances, pharmaceuticals and confectionary industries ( Zhu et al.
18: 2001).
19: Of late, they have received considerable attention as potentially active, human and environment friendly bio insecticides ( Cheng et al.
20: 2003).
21: There are several reports on larvicidal activity of essential oil from neem, basil, citronella, lemon, eucalyptus, pine etc ( Cheng et al.
22: 2003,  Amer and Mehlhorn 2006,  Dua et al.
23: 2009).
24: The resistance against plant derived insecticides has not been reported so far ( Kannathasan et al.
25: 2011).
0: Coccinia grandis (family Cucurbitaceae) is a unique tropical plant, commonly known as little gourd, growing abundantly and widely all over the India.
1: It is a fast growing perennial climbing shrub with white flowers.
2: It grows several meters long and forms dense mat that readily cover shrubs and small trees.
3: It is well known for its hypoglycemic activity ( Ajay 2009,  Munasinghe et al.
4: 2011).
0: The present study was focused on the chemical constituents and larvicidal activity of  Coccinia grandis leaf essential oil against vectors of malaria ( An.
1: stephensi), dengue ( Ae.
2: aegypti) and filariasis ( Culex quinquefasciatus).
3: To the best of our knowledge it is the first report on the larvicidal activity of  Coccinia grandis leaf essential oil against the three mosquito species.

1: Introduction
0: The tick  Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus (Canestrini, 1887) is an ectoparasite of cattle [ 1], present in tropical and subtropical areas of America, Africa, Asia, and Australia in latitudes between 32N and 32S [ 2,  3].
1: About the damage caused by this parasite, direct losses in the production of milk and meat, leather damage caused by inflammatory reactions at the sites of tick attachment, appearance of myiasis, and the transmission of diseases such as bovine tick fever (caused by protozoa of the genus  Babesia and by bacteria of the genus  Anaplasma) could be mentioned [ 4].
2: The economic losses of Brazil related to ticks are estimated by 3.24 billion dollars a year, represented by the direct action of the parasite in the animals and by the cost of the control systems [ 5].
0: One of the strategies to minimize the economic losses caused by this pest involves reducing tick populations to economically acceptable levels [ 6].
1: But the inherent problems in controlling this parasite are acaricide resistance, and environmental residues resulted in only partial success of tick control [ 7].
2: The searches for environmentally safe products have accelerated the research on botanical acaricides [ 8,  9].
3: Plants have been used as food, spices, and medicines for thousands of years.
4: These medicines initially took the form of crude drugs such as a variety of plants formulations.
5: Natural products have been the origin of many important molecules in drug discoveries.
6: Different culinary herbs have been screened for their biological activities.
7: The active ingredients from plants are known to possess insecticidal, growth inhibiting, antimoulting, and repellent activities [ 8].
8: Thus, there is increasing interest in alternative methods for tick control and growing demand for nonchemical products in livestock that are safer to animals and the environment [ 10,  11].
9: Botanical alternatives, such as essential oils, are currently receiving particular attention [ 12].
0: In Brazil, the Rutaceae family comprises about 38 genera and 22 species [ 13].
1: Citrus limonum (L.) comprises 3 species and various hybrids.
2: Species of this genus are known to show monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, such as limonene and  -pinene [ 14,  15].
3: Essential oils of this kind have been evaluated for presenting biological activities such as insecticide, cytotoxic, and antibacterial activities [ 16].
0: Piper nigrum (L.), popularly known as black pepper, is a member of family Piperaceae [ 17,  18].
1: The genus  Piper includes more than 1000 species, but the best known are  P. nigrum, Piper longum, and  Piper betle [ 19,  20].
2: The fruits of  P. nigrum contain piperine, a compound that has already shown leishmanicidal activity [ 21].
3: Furthermore, secondary metabolites of this species possess active compounds with insecticidal activity, antibacterial, antifungal, and others [ 20,  22].
0: The aim of this work is to develop natural products, like essential oils, for the combat of the cattle tick.
0: Introduction
0: Concerns regarding the safety of chemical preservatives and the negative reactions of consumers against these components have led to an increasing interest in the use of natural preservatives, such as plant EOs and probiotics.
1: 1,2 Some of the most considerable aspects of the functions of plant EOs are the pathogen growth inhibition, delaying food spoilage and the improvement of organoleptic quality.
2: Using natural products as antibacterial compounds can reduce health hazards and economic losses that have been produced by foodborne microorganisms.
3: 3 The EOs and their components are known to be active against a wide variety of microorganisms, including gram-negative 4 and gram-positive bacteria.
4: 5 Gram-negative bacteria are shown to be generally more resistant than gram-positive ones to the antagonistic effects of EOs because of the presence of lipopolysaccharide in their outer membrane.

0: Introduction
0: Essential oil is a complex composition that consists of tens to hundreds of compounds.
1: Major components that can be identified in the essential oil include oxygenated monoterpenes, hydrocarbons monoterpene, oxygenated sesquiterpenes, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, carbonylic compounds, phenols, fatty acids and esters [ 1].
2: The chemical composition of essential oil is influenced by several factors, including the level and type of plant species, area, season, temperature, humidity, and other abiotic factors [ 2,  3].
3: In general, the composition of essential oil is known as secondary metabolites and classified as terpenoids and polipropenoid [ 4].
4: Currently, it has been proven that there are two distinct and independent biosynthetic routes, that is the isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) route and allylic isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) route, which produces the two compound groups in plants [ 5].
5: These two biosynthetic routes are known as mevalonate pathway to the terpenoids, while phenylpropanoids derived from shikimate pathway [ 6,  7].
6: Researchers argue that there is association between the terpenoid formation with enzyme types and enzymatic reaction mechanisms in biosynthetic processes that involves a variety of reactions, such as hydride shift or methyl group, hydration, protonation, cyclization and isomerization.
7: Genetic modification of metabolic pathways provides some promising results to increase the volatile production, therefore, bacteria, yeast and plants are genetically modified for the production of volatile terpenoids derived from shikimic acid.
8: There are several different explanations about the volatile metabolites production by transgenic microorganisms and genetically modified crops [ 8].
0: Researchers conclude that this type of approach can be successfully used to generate the level of terpenoids.
1: However, modification of several groups of these compounds is quite difficult because the terpenoids reservoir precursor may not be sufficient for large production of the desired compound [ 9,  10].
2: Behrendorff examined the culture media to identify the genes and the production of limonene by using  Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and use this information to develop a media in limonene biosynthesis process [ 10].
3: Terpenoid biosynthesis reaction produces a complex chemical composition of essential oil, both seen from the type of functional group and a carbon skeleton, so almost all kinds of isomer can be found in every type of essential oil.
4: Monoterpenes is the main component of essential oil, whether it is in the form of monoterpenes with open or cyclic carbonic chain.
5: Most of these monoterpenes just have a little difference in the molecular mass and often found as the same isomers.
6: The presence of terpene isomers that have the same structure, physical properties, boiling point, and polarity pushed researchers to develop a method to improve the performance capabilities of GC tool for a quick analysis [ 11].
7: Citronellal, geraniol and nerol are the functional isomers of monoterpenoid, while citral is the lemonal from a mixture of terpenoid isomers that is known as the double bond isomers.
8: Citronellal is responsible for the distinctive aroma of lemon, while the geraniol and nerol is the main monoterpenoid alcohol component of rose oil and, palmarosa oil.
9: Isomer is known as geranial or citral A, while the Z-isomer is known as neral or citral B [ 12].
10: Z and E configuration difference is caused by the small differences in polarity that affect the strength of interaction between molecules.
11: A number of essential oil components are enantiomers to each other and these compounds only differ in their interaction with polarized light.
12: Enantiomers have identical physical properties, such as boiling point, melting point and spectroscopic spectrum, but it may have different aroma and different taste that can affect the oil quality and also its bioactivity.
13: Results from the enantiomers composition analysis on linalool to 42 types of essential oils by using FSC chiral column with a modified -Cyclodextrine (Lipodex E) showed that there are more (-) linalool than (+) limonene, but both are an active antimicrobial, antifungal and antimalarial [ 13].
14: The purpose of this study is to examine the distribution of major and minor components on each kaffir lime oil fraction by using fractional distillation, that is performed under reduced pressure and adjusted reflux ratio.
0: Material and instrument: The kaffir lime oil sample was obtained from Ngunut, Tulungagung, East Java.

3: Fractional distillation: Fractional distillation was performed on lime oil (2 L) by using a PiloDist 104-VTU under reduced pressure, length = 2 m, number of stages = 120, and the conditions were monitored by using a computer.
4: Heating jacket coat were used as a heat source.
5: Fractional distillation was performed repeatedly with varied reflux ratio of 10/10, 20/10 and 60/10, with 0 mbar, 5 mbar and 10 mbar pressure variation.
6: Each fraction is collected and its volume was measured.
7: The fractional distillation was done in Laboratory of Chemistry, LIPI Serpong, Tangerang, West Java.
0: Analysis by GC-MS: Kaffir lime oil and its fractions was analyzed by using a GC-MS Shimadzu type (QP 2010s) with bombardier electron system of 70 eV in voltage, injector temperature was at 280C, detector temperature at 320C, pressure foreline: 4 Pa, and the mass range of 30-425 amu).
1: HP-5 (Hewlett Packard-5) capillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 pM) was used.
2: Gas flow rate on helium carrier was 1 mL/min and the column temperature was programmed as follows: initial temperature 80C was maintained for 10 minutes, then the temperature was increased from 80C to 300C with the increase rate of 4C/minute.
3: Then the chromatogram was formed.

5: This genus provides an excellent source of essential oil components such as monoterpenes, aliphatic hydrocarbons, sesquiterpenes among others compounds.
6: Plant  P. tobira discovered by the Europeans, is about 23 m high, the leaves are dark green, flowers have a smell similar to orange flowers and the black seeds are enclosed within the encapsulated fruits.
7: Previous studies on the composition of  P. tobira essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation procedure, have indicated the presence of  -pinene as the major component of the flowers for species growing in Iran [ 9].
8: This plant has been demonstrated to possess many pharmaceutical properties.
9: Moon and Park [ 10], reported its protective effects against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity.
10: Moreover, El Dib et al.
11: [ 11], determined that the n-butanol fraction from  P. tobira leaves possess antimicrobial activity and cytoprotective effects against breast carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and colon carcinoma cancer cell lines.
12: However, data on the antioxidant activities of seed essential oils from this plant are insufficient.
13: Hence, the aim of the present research is to determine nutritional value, phenolic compound and biological activities of  P. tobira methanolic extract.
14: The aroma compounds composition of  P. tobira seeds were also identified by headspace solid phase microextraction and hydrodistillation coupled to gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry and their antioxidant and anti-hemolytic capacities were studied.

0: The therapeutical applications of Bergamot essential oil are related to its antiseptic, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties.
1: Of particular interest is also the composition of bergamot juice and albedo because of the presence of molecules with important biological and pharmacological activities [ 23 26].
2: Furthermore, it is employed in aromatherapy as an antidepressant to reduce anxiety and stress by improving mood and facilitating sleep induction [ 27 33].
0: The determination of headspace composition in bergamot essential oil is extremely useful in aromatherapy.
1: Nevertheless, greater efforts are still needed to develop a simple and objective methodology.
0: In the present work, we studied the composition of the gaseous phase at equilibrium with the liquid phase of bergamot essential oil by developing a gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GCMS) method useful for the determination of the volatile aroma components.
0: Phytotherapy employs fully characterized active ingredients extracted from plants for the treatment and prevention of many diseases.
0: Essential oils and their components exhibit various biological activities and are also used for human disease prevention and treatment.
1: They exert antiviral, antidiabetic, antimicrobial and cancer suppressive activities [ 1,  2], furthermore they play a key role in cardiovascular diseases prevention including atherosclerosis and thrombosis [ 3,  4].
0: Today aromatherapy, a branch of phytotherapy, is gaining momentum as complementary therapy to the traditional medicine [ 5].
1: Aromatherapy uses essential oils via inhalation or massage as the main therapeutic agents to treat several diseases.
2: The inhalation of volatile aromatic substances extracted from plants can affect the mood and state of health of the person by inducing psychological and physical effects [ 6 10].
3: The transdermal and transmucosal application of essential oils also concerns the phytotherapy [ 11].
0: Recently, some papers [ 12,  13] have tried to give scientific value to the aromatherapy, traditionally based on empirical observations and evaluations also poorly stringent, by establishing criteria similar to those that support the rigorous scientific research [ 14].
1: It has been verified in fact, which among hundreds of papers related to aromatherapy inhalation only a few are scientifically significant [ 15].
0: In order to use the essential oil appropriately it is important knowing its chemical compositions and characteristics.
1: It seems clear, however, that if the essential oils are delivered by inhalation, the determination of gas phase (or headspace) composition above the liquid essential oil sample becomes critical [ 16,  17].
0: The migration of volatile molecules into the headspace phase does not just depend on their volatility but also on their affinity for the liquid phase sample; volatile compounds relative concentrations between the two phases will reach an equilibrium value.
1: At equilibrium, the partial pressure of each volatile component in the headspace vapor will be equivalent to the vapor pressure that is directly proportional to its mole fraction in the liquid phase.
2: In essence, the concentration of a compound in the headspace is proportional to its concentration in the liquid phase and can be affected by temperature, respective volumes of the sample and the headspace, and other factors [ 18].
3: Thus, headspace phase composition can be very different from that of the liquid phase.
0: Over the years specific studies designed to identify an analysis procedure for the determination of headspace gas at equilibrium with liquid essential oil have been reported [ 19 21].
1: These works are mostly based on the use of solid-phase microextraction (SPME) by which the headspace gas is extracted by a fused silica fiber coated with a suitable stationary phase (HS-SPME) [ 19,  20].
2: The volatile compounds adsorbed on the fiber are then thermally desorbed in the GC injector port of a GCMS instrument to perform the qualitative analysis and GCFID for the quantitative determination [ 22].
0: However, the composition of volatile compounds adsorbed on the fiber is different from that of headspace gas in equilibrium with the essential oil since the adsorption on the fiber depends on the fiber characteristics and extraction conditions used for the analysis.
1: Therefore, this procedure is not sufficient to define the actual composition of the vapor phase in equilibrium with the essential oil, and hence poorly applicable to the study of aromatherapy.
0: Bergamot ( Citrus bergamia) is an endemic plant of the Calabria region in the south of Italy and its fruit is used for the extraction of bergamot essential oil (BEO).
1: Bergamot essential oil is the basic component of perfumes and is also used in the formulation of cosmetic products, food and confections as a flavouring.
0: INTRODUCTION
0: Since the middle ages, essential oils have widely been used for bactericidal, virucidal, fungicidal, medicinal, and cosmetic applications, especially nowadays in pharmaceutical, sanitary, cosmetic, and agricultural and food industries.
1: Because of the mode of extraction, mostly by hydrodistillation from aromatic plants, they contain a variety of volatile molecules such as terpenes and terpenoids phenol-derived aromatic components, and aliphatic components.
2: [ 1] Apiaceae is one of the important flowering plant families that are scattered around the world.
3: This family includes 420 genera, 3100 species.
4: Ferula is one the important genera in this family which consists 133 species distributed throughout Mediterranean area and central Asia.
5: [ 234] More than 70 species of  Ferula have already been investigated chemically leading to the fact that germacranes, humulanes, carotanes, and guaianes represent the main sesquiterpene constituents of the genus.
6: [ 5678910111213] Several species of this genus have been used in folk medicine.
7: [ 6] -pinene and  -pinene are reported as a major constituent of most studied  Ferula taxa and considered as chemotype of  Ferula.
8: [ 14] Giant fennel ( Ferula communis L. characterized by two chemotypes with different biological activities.
9: One chemotype is poisonous, due to prenyl coumarins, and responsible for ferulosis, which mainly affects sheep and goats, cattle, and horses; the other chemotype is nonpoisonous and contains daucane esters.
10: The two chemotypes cannot be distinguished botanically.
11: Major volatiles in the poisonous chemotype the sesquiterpenes aristolene and farnesol while in the nonpoisonous chemotype, the main component was the sesquiterpene allohedycaryol.
12: [ 15] For rapid and unequivocal discrimination of the two chemotypes, aristolene and allohedycaryol had been used as markers of the poisonous and nonpoisonous  Ferula chemotypes, respectively.
13: [ 16]  Ferula tingitana L. (giant Tangier fennel) is a tall perennial herb.
14: It has alternate leaf arrangement and yellow, unisexual flowers which, like other Apiaceae, grow in umbels.
15: It grows in scrubland and rocky areas.
16: Its range is the Mediterranean coast[ 17] in Spain, Morocco, Lebanon, Isral, Cyprus, and Turkey.
17: [ 181920] Sesquiterpene ester, tingitanol and sesquiterpene coumarin ethers coladonin, feselol isosamarcandin angelate, and daucane esters were isolated from the root.
18: [ 212223]  F. tingitana has been considered to have abortive and menstruation-inducing properties.
19: [ 24] The species has been suggested as a possible identity for the controversial silphium a plant used as a spice and for various medical purposes in the Mediterranean region.
20: [ 25] It was said that it could be used to treat cough, sore throat, fever, indigestion, aches and pains, warts, and all kinds of maladies.
21: [ 26] However, reports neither on composition nor on the bioactivity of the essential oil of Libyan plant could not be traced in the available literature.
22: The aim of the study is to establish the chemical composition of the essential oil of flower, leaves of  F. tingitana and to throw light on antimicrobial, cytotoxic activities of Libyan plant.
23: Furthermore, compare between Libyan ferula and other varieties (Turkish and Iranian).
0: INTRODUCTION
0: Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a zoonotic parasitic disease which is caused by the larval form of  Echinococcus granulosus tapeworm.
1: [ 1] CE has a worldwide distribution but is mostly prevalent in the rural areas, in which it is transmitted in a cycle between dogs (definitive host), as domestic livestock, and humans, as the intermediate host.
2: [ 23] CE may develop in humans after the accidental ingestion of tapeworm eggs excreted with the feces of an infected dog.
3: The eggs hatch in the intestine of the herbivore, penetrate into the intestinal wall, and reach the livers (50%70%), lungs (20%30%), or any other organs through the portal system, in which they develop to a hydatid cyst.
4: [ 45] At present, surgical intervention (conventional or laparoscopic approaches) is the ideal treatment for CE.
5: In addition, cyst puncture, aspiration, injection of chemicals, and reaspiration, chemotherapy with benzimidazole compounds, and watching and waiting for inactive, clinically silent cysts are the substitute treatments to surgery, particularly for the patients who cannot tolerate surgery.
6: [ 67] Through the surgery for dropping threat of intraoperative outflow of protoscoleces (cyst contents) and followed by the repetition of CE and secondary infection, it is necessary to apply effective protoscolicidal agents.
7: [ 89] At this time, the accessible protoscolicidal agents including hypertonic saline and silver nitrate are connected with some serious adverse effects such as biliary tract fibrosis and liver necrosis.
8: [ 101112] Therefore, the expansion of new helpful scolicidal agents, mainly from natural resources with little side effects and higher efficiency, is extremely important for surgeons.
0: Reviews have reported antimicrobial activity of plants and derivative essential oils, extracts, and other phytoconstituents.
1: [ 131415] Essential oils are an important supply of new antimicrobial agents as a result of their two imperative properties: further protection to people and environment in addition to low risk of the appearance of microbial resistance, given that they have components which possibly will indicate a range of mechanisms of antimicrobial effects.
2: [ 1617] Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume (Lauraceae) has long been used as a spice and flavoring agent in different cultures around the world for several centuries.
3: True cinnamon or  C. zeylanicum is the inner bark of a small evergreen tree, which is considered a medication for respiratory, digestive, and gynecological disorders.
4: [ 1819] A range of pharmacological functions in antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimicrobial, and antidiabetic terms has been attributed to this plant.
5: [ 202122] Previous investigations have found cinnamaldehyde, camphene, linalool, a-phelendrene, a-terpinene, and limonene as the main constituents of  C. zeylanicum essential oil.
6: [ 21] However, some factors such as location and seasonal variations could affect the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of this essential oil.
7: [ 23] This study analyzes the chemical composition of the essential oil obtained from  C. zeylanicum bark, its scolicidal effects on protoscoleces of  E. granulosus, and its toxicity in mice.

1: Introduction
0: Physical fatigue will occur sooner or later depending on the type of exercise.
1: Physical fatigue is commonly defined as the inability to sustain or maintain voluntary activity, and it is considered to be associated with a physiological decline [ 1].
2: Several theories have been proposed to explain physical fatigue, including the exhaustion theory, the radical theory, and the clogging theory.
3: The exhaustion theory proposed that depletion of energy stocks within the body, such as glucose or glycogen, could lead to fatigue.
4: However, the clogging theory, that is, the excessive accumulation of blood lactic acid (BLA) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), would cause metabolic disorders that would eventually result in the fatigue.
5: The radical theory hypothesizes that intensive exercise could produce an imbalance between the body's oxidation system and its antioxidation system.
6: Muscle cells have defense mechanisms that scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as SOD, GSH-Px, and CAT and protect cells against exercise-induced oxidative injury [ 1 4].
7: Recovery from exercise-induced fatigue requires repairing the damage that has occurred in the body and eliminating the metabolic products that accumulated during exercise [ 3].
0: Essential oils are complex mixtures of strongly odoriferous volatile compounds that are synthesized in various plant organs and have diverse ecological functions [ 5].
1: Aromatic essential oils are frequently considered as potential new treatments [ 6] for various disorders, including fatigue.
2: For instance, Jaradat et al.
3: [ 7] showed that the inhalation of the  Citrus sinensis flower essential oil could improve athletic performance.
4: Citrus sinensis (L.), also known as orange or sweet orange, is a small tree in the family Rutaceae.
5: The peel oil has antibacterial, antioxidant, or anxiolytic properties [ 8 10], and the key compound it contains is d-limonene (73.997%), along with various amounts of linalool, geraniol, and nerol [ 11].
6: A previous study showed that treatment with orange peel essential oil decreased oxidative injury by decreasing the serum malondialdehyde (MDA) level and increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes in subjects [ 12], and these effects may help prevent physical fatigue.
0: Raudenbush et al.
1: [ 13] showed that peppermint aroma was effective on perceived physical workload, temporal workload, effort, and anxiety.
2: Peppermint ( Mentha piperita) is a popular herb that can be used in numerous forms (i.e., oil, leaf, leaf extract, and leaf water).
3: The leaf oil has the most uses; it has a variety of therapeutic properties and is used in aromatherapy, bath preparations, mouthwashes, toothpastes, and topical preparations [ 14].
4: Menthol (29%) and menthone (2030%) are the major components of the peppermint leaf essential oil [ 15].
5: Inhalation of peppermint essential oil improved the lung capacity and inhalation ability in healthy participants; thus Meamarbashi and Rajabi speculated this effect supply more oxygen to the brain, which could be effective in continuing physical performance [ 15].
0: Rosemary has been used in traditional medicine as a stimulant, and it has been considered as one of the most effective herbs for treating physical and mental fatigue [ 5].
1: Rosemary ( Rosmarinus officinalis L., Lamiaceae) is a woody perennial herb, and the highest quality essential oil of  R. officinalis L. is obtained from the leaves.
2: Rosemary essential oil consists mostly of monoterpenes such as 1,8-cineole (43.77%), camphor (12.53%), and  -pinene (11.51%) [ 16,  17].
3: Most pharmacological effects of rosemary are a consequence of the high antioxidant activity of its main chemical constituents, which has been mainly attributed to its major diterpenes, carnosol, and carnosic acid, as well as to the essential oil components [ 18].
0: Syzygium aromaticum (L.), or clove, is a dried unopened flower bud of  Syzygium aromaticum (L.) Merr.
1: & Perry (Family Myrtaceae) [ 19].
2: The essential oil extracted from the dried flower buds of cloves is used as a topical application to relieve pain and to promote healing and is also used in the medical, fragrance, and flavoring industries [ 20].
3: The major component of clove essential oil is considered to be eugenol with lesser amounts of  -caryophyllene and eugenyl acetate.
4: Eugenol is the primary constituent that has high antiradical activity [ 21].
5: In addition to antioxidant activity, clove essential oil increases the content of antibody-forming lymphocyte cells in the spleen [ 22].
0: That is, clove essential oil may powerfully protect the cellular structure from being attacked and damaged after exercising to exhaustion.
0: Exercise-induced fatigue is characterized by two signs: deterioration of performance is the primary sign, and tiredness/exhaustion is the secondary sign.
1: A mixture of four essential oils may be used to treat exercise-induced fatigue: two stimulant essential oils, one relaxing essential oil and a balancing essential oil.
2: Peppermint essential oil can increase alertness and mental clarity and decrease the perceived physical workload [ 23].
3: Rosemary essential oil inspires energy and stimulates vitality [ 5].
4: Orange essential oil is known for its calming and soothing properties that relax the muscles [ 12].
5: As a balancing essential oil, clove essential oil significantly increases the free radical scavenging capacity of the other oils, thus preventing oxidative injury during fatigue.
6: In addition, peppermint and orange essential oils evaporate more quickly than rosemary essential oil, and clove oil volatilizes the slowest, so appropriate proportions of each oil can create a lasting balance.
0: Previous studies have shown that peppermint essential oil, which is most widely used to prevent fatigue, significantly improves exercise performance [ 24,  25].
1: Therefore, peppermint essential oil was used as a positive control in the present study, and its effects were compared to the therapeutic effects of the experimental essential oil mixture.
2: The aim of this study was to assess the antiphysical fatigue effects of supplementation with the essential oil mixture by inhalation on the time to exhaustion, blood glucose, BLA, and other biochemical parameters.
0: Introduction
0: Metabolomic profiles from organisms in the Plantae and other kingdoms have been used to distinguish samples from different species and ecotypes, as well as aid in their classification ( Dettmer et al., 2007;  Allwood et al., 2011;  Aliferis et al., 2013;  Jing et al., 2015).
1: In the case of plants, much attention has been given to one of the largest group of metabolites they produce, the terpenoids.
2: In a study similar to ours which explored the chemodiversity of  Selaginella in the context of evolution,  Weng and Noel (2013) suggest that monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthases are derived from conserved diterpene synthases, based off of phylogenetic analyses of plant terpene synthases done by  Bohlmann et al.
3: (1998).
4: Thus, it appears that monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are frequently used as chemical markers for distinguishing between genera.
5: For example, in the  Lantana (Verbenaceae) genus, -caryophyllene was the major compound suggested as a chemical marker ( Sena Filho et al., 2010), while in  Citrus, both cyclic ( R-(+)-limonene and -terpinene) and bicyclic monoterpenes ( -pinene and sabinene) were dominant in fruit essential oils and therefore proposed as markers for those species/varieties ( Jing et al., 2015).
6: Worldwide, the volatile metabolomics composition of  Vitex species has been poorly investigated, likely due to their accessibility and phenotype, namely, their size and bad odor.
7: From a total of 250 species, only about 35 are reported in the literature with in-depth chemical characterizations.
8: Many of them are difficult to identify due to endemism, e.g.,  Vitex rufences A. Juss,  Vitex capitata Vahl,  Vitex gardneriana Schauer, which are found only in areas in the northeast of Brazil.
0: The main goal of this study was to develop a metabolomics approach for evaluating the volatile composition of  Vitex species, using four species we collected ( Vitex capitata Vahl,  Vitex megapotamica (Spreng.)
1: Moldenke,  Vitex gardneriana Schauer and  Vitex rufescens A. Juss) in addition to 13  Vitex species published in the literature.
2: First, the chemical composition of the volatile fraction of essential oils from leaves of these species was characterized via GC-MS/FID.
3: Subsequently, cluster analyses of the chemical composition of the 17  Vitex species were performed.
4: Next, Inter-Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) was used to evaluate the genetic variation between our four  Vitex species, followed by cluster analyses.
5: Lastly, bioactivity of our four essential oil extracts was evaluated using toxicity assays against  Aceria guerreronis Keifer (Acari: Eriophyidae), a major pest found in coconut plantations worldwide ( Navia et al., 2013).
6: From this study, we aimed to chemosystematically characterize the  Vitex genus, in addition to expand our understanding of it in an evolutionary context.

1: Introduction
0: Essential oils (EOs) are one of the most important natural products derived from plants for their various biological properties and medicinal uses [ 1,  2].
1: EOs have been utilized in different domestic aspects such as in perfumery, cosmetics, feed, food, and beverages.
2: Several researchers demonstrated the possibility of utilizing EOs in cooking, where they give a pleasant taste to food and are utilized mostly in processed food.
3: Recently, there has been great interest in the use of EOs for their curative effects in aromatherapy [ 3].
4: Plant EOs were largely utilized in pharmaceutical and other related medical uses as one of the most important and effective ingredients.
0: The current review intends to discuss some aspects of plant EOs and their main single constituents ranging from an overview of historical perspective, analytical techniques for chemical analysis (classical and modern methods), bioactivity of single substances (mode of action, factors affecting their bioactivity, and common families of aromatic Mediterranean plants), medical uses for human health and biological characterization including pharmacological aspects (anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticarcinogenic effects), and antimicrobial effects (antibacterial and antifungal activities).
0: This review gives also an insight into the chemical composition of some important EOs and their principal bioactive single constituents.
1: Detailed information focuses on the mechanism of bioactivity action of the main bioactive single constituents of some important plant EOs such as sage, oregano, thyme, marjoram, and vervain related to different families such as Lamiaceae, Apiaceae, Rutaceae, and Verbenaceae.

1: Introduction
0: In the last three decades, a huge progress in medicinal plants research has been observed.
1: In fact, the global interest towards the use of herbal remedies has created a huge need for information about the uses and the therapeutic properties of these plants [ 1].
2: Essential oils are among the most interesting components of herbals and plants.
3: These essential oils are rich in hydrocarbon compounds that have oxygenated, hydrogenated, and dehydrogenated functional groups.
4: Most of these chemicals are monoterpenoid or sesquiterpenoids.
5: They are odorous principles, which are found in various plants parts and evaporate at ordinary temperature [ 2,  3].
6: They are used as therapeutic agents in ethno, conventional, and complementary alternative medicines particularly as analgesics, anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, local anesthetic, anthelmintic, antipruritic, and antiseptic as well as many other therapeutic uses [ 4 7].
0: Nowadays, essential oils are used broadly in medicine and cosmeceutical and pharmaceutical industries and as flavoring agents and preservatives in food industry and design [ 8,  9].
1: In addition, it is scientifically accepted that natural antioxidants exert health promoting effects and their consumption as food or as food additives or as nutraceuticals and supplements have been greatly promoted worldwide.
2: A complex mixture of antioxidants may account for improvement of cardiovascular health and decreased incidence of cancer in individuals who consume more of these substances [ 10 12].
3: In elderly subjects, a higher intake of antioxidants is linked with improved health compared to subjects consuming less fruits and vegetables in their diet [ 13 15].
0: On the other hand, many food industries utilize synthetic chemical preservatives to extend the shelf life of the produced commercial food products.
1: Unfortunately, the chronic intake of these chemicals may cause carcinogenic or toxic effects to consumers.
2: Accordingly, a growing interest in the discovery of new natural antimicrobial and antioxidant agent has been observed in order to avoid or minimize the undesirable consequences and side effects related to the consumption of chemical preservatives [ 16 18].
3: In fact, the so-called hurdle technology, combining antioxidant and antimicrobial agents, has gained wide acceptance within the food and pharmaceutical industries [ 19].
0: Combining two or more compounds could be more effective for improving antioxidant and antimicrobial activity and could offer a synergistic potential.
1: However, the use of phytochemicals to prevent foodborne microbes is poorly studied [ 20 22].
2: Many scientific investigations concluded that the chemical compositions and yields of essential oils may be affected by environmental factors such as seasonal and climate variations, geographical conditions, and growth stages of the plant in addition to the genetic factors for the same plant species [ 23 30].
0: Ruta chalepensis L. (Rutaceae), commonly known as Rue or Fringed rue, is a wild perennial herbaceous shrubs which is widely distributed in the Mediterranean Sea regions.
1: It usually grows on the rocky slopes of mountains.
2: It is has glabrous, alternate bipinnatisect leaves with narrow oblong lanceolate or obovate segments and cymose inflorescence [ 31].
3: It is the only rue species mentioned and covered in the Flora Palaestina and even mentioned in the Bible under the Greek name Pigam, closely cognate with the Arabic name Figam which is used as flavor for honey, wine, and olive oil [ 32].
4: Due to its high content of amino acids, saponins, phenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, and furocoumarins in the leaves and young stems,  R. chalepensis has pleiotropic pharmacological activities [ 33].
5: It has been used widely in various folk medicines as analgesic and antipyretic and for treatment of mental disorders, convulsions, rheumatism, dropsy, neuralgia and bleeding disorders [ 34 38].
0: In the Palestinian traditional medicine, it has been used for treatment of asthma, renal colic, arthritis, rheumatism, backache, skin bacterial and fungal diseases, eye inflammation and ear infection.
1: Besides that, it has been used as antitussive, antispasmodic, anti-inflammatory, antilice, sedative, and bronchodilator and also for treatment of snake bites [ 39 41].
2: R. chalepensis essential oil showed potential repellent activity against  Aegorhinus superciliosus and  Aedes albopictus [ 42].
3: Therefore, the aims of the current study were to identify the chemical composition of  R. chalepensis growing wildly in three regions of the West Bank area of Palestine.
4: Afterwards, screening and comparison of their antimicrobial and antioxidant activity were conducted.

0: Animal protein is still far more expensive than their plant counterpart for most dwellers of the developing countries, and for years this has aroused the rigorous researches on underutilized legumes and oilseeds that can be used as protein source in food ingredients and functional foods formulation (Chavan, McKenzie, & Shahidi,  2001; Sreerama, Neelam, Sashikala, & Pratape,  2010).
1: The nutritional and functional properties of protein isolate from legumes and oilseeds has increased their rate of application in meats and sausages, baked and extruded products, salad dressings and frozen desserts (Asgar, Fazilah, Huda, Bhat, & Karim,  2010; Day,  2013).
0: Conophor nut ( Tetracarpidium conophorum), commonly called African walnut, is one of the greatly underutilized oilseeds belonging to the family  Euphorbiaceae.
1: The monoecious and highclimbing plant produce seeds which become dark brown with hard testa when mature.
2: Its economic importance lies in the edibility of its oilrich seeds which are consumed in SubSaharan Africa (Enujiugha,  2008).
3: The nut is rich in minerals and highquality proteins (Odoemelam,  2003; Edem, Dosunmu, & Bassey,  2009).
4: This makes it a potential plant protein that can supplement the monotonous starchy staples being consumed by many in developing countries with little or no alternatives.
0: The bitter aftertaste of raw conophor nut upon reaction with water has greatly limited its use in food product development.
1: Till date, neither is there any final product application reported for the oilrich seed nor any use as protein supplement.
2: Processing through the application of heat has been reported to reduce antinutritional factors and toxic contents in nuts and legumes resulting in more effective use of the seeds (Devappa & Swamylingappa,  2008; Arinola & Adesina,  2014).
3: Toasting, aside from reducing antinutrients, improves the taste and nutrient quality of food products and lowers the moisture contents, thus increasing the shelf life.
4: The amino acid composition and functional properties of cashew nut were reported to have improved due to processing (Fagbemi,  2009).
0: In recent times, the food industries employ more of the protein concentrates and isolates from plants rather than the flour protein with their naturally occurring matrices that include carbohydrates and lipids (Arogundade, Eromosele, Ademuyiwa, & Eromosele,  2009; Shevkani, Kaur, Kumar, & Singh,  2015).
1: Soy and wheat are among the most used plant protein isolate and concentrates, however, due to the allergenicity of these plants, the search for alternative is imperative (Boye et al.,  2010).
2: The fullfat seed, defatted flour, and protein isolate of raw conophor nut had been shown to exhibit several desirable functions that could enhance its use in the food system (Enujiugha,  2003; Ndie, Nnamani, & Oselebe,  2010; Gbadamosi, Abiose, & Aluko,  2012a).
3: However, there is the need for improvement on these functionalities to further enhance the desirability of conophor nut as a food ingredient.
0: In this study, conophor nut was processed by boiling and toasting and the effect of these heat processing operations on the nutritional quality and functional characteristics of the defatted oil seeds and protein isolates were analyzed along with the amino acid composition.
1: This is expected to provide information on the possible uses of conophor proteins as potential functional ingredients and food supplements.

1: Introduction
0: Cumin ( Cuminum cyminum L.) is one of the most important spicy and medical plants in the world, which belongs to the Apiaceae family.
1: The Apiaceae family consists of 455 genera and over 3500 species and is regarded as one of the largest plant families [ 1,  2].
2: An effective and reproducible in vitro regeneration system is required for studies on genetic manipulation in each plant species [ 3].
3: Somatic embryogenesis is the developmental restructuring of somatic cells toward the embryogenic pathway and forms the basis of cellular totipotency in higher plants [ 4].
4: Somatic embryogenesis is one of the most effective techniques to be used in biotechnological studies such as producing transgenic plants, artificial seeds, micropropagation, and germplasm conservation [ 5,  6].
5: Somatic embryogenesis was initially reported in the Apiaceae family and in vitro culture of carrot [ 7,  8].
6: Genotypic properties of plants, physiological characteristics of the explant, and cell status in plant tissues can be mentioned as factors influencing somatic embryogenesis [ 9].
7: Somatic embryogenesis is a model system for understanding the physiological, biochemical, and molecular biological events occurring during plant embryo development [ 4].
8: Studies showed that various genotypes in a plant species have different embryogenesis capabilities, depending on genetic and biochemical properties, ability level of key elements in regeneration path, and also endogenous phytohormones metabolism [ 10].
9: Dave and Batra [ 11] conducted the first study of somatic embryogenesis in cumin using different explants including root, hypocotyls, and cotyledons.
10: They stated that hypocotyl explants in MS medium complemented with 8 mg/L BA showed the best response to embryogenesis and emphasized the necessity of cytokinins hormone for production and development of cumin somatic embryos [ 11].
11: It seems that auxin hormones were stimulators of intracellular biochemical reactions and specific genes in preembryo cells, which are required for producing globular embryos.
12: The researchers observed that elimination of auxin from medium can lead to the continuation of somatic embryogenesis [ 8,  12,  13].
13: Measurement of chemical compositions such as contents of proline, protein, and antioxidant enzymes including catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, and peroxidase has been used as a marker to evaluate somatic embryogenesis in different studies [ 10,  14,  15].
14: Studies suggest that antioxidant enzymes such as catalase and ascorbate peroxidase play an important role in maturity and differentiation of plant tissues and their high activity affects cellular processes such as somatic embryogenesis [ 10,  16,  17].
15: Terpenic hydrocarbons, alcohols, and phenols existing in the essential oil of plants are among the genetic properties affecting somatic embryogenesis.
16: Researchers stated that terpenic hydrocarbons have positive effects on somatic embryogenesis process, while alcohols and phenols have negative effects on the process [ 18 20].
17: Ebrahimie et al.
18: [ 3] used the cut seed embryo of cumin as an explant in B5 medium and introduced 0.4 mg IAA + 0.2 mg NAA + 0.1 mg BAP as the best hormone combination.
19: Kahrizi and Soorni [ 21] used 2,4-D and Kin in cumin developed embryogenic calluses and reported that an increase in the concentration of 2,4-D hormones has a positive effect on somatic embryogenesis, but their study was only confined to callus formation and they did not report on regeneration and adaptation.
20: Although few studies were conducted on somatic embryogenesis and regeneration in cumin, already no report has been registered on the relationships between genetic properties like chemical compositions existing in the plant and somatic embryogenesis process and evaluation of somaclonal variation of regenerated plants.
21: Therefore, the current study is aimed at measuring chemical compositions, optimizing somatic embryogenesis and regeneration, assessment of somaclonal variation in regenerated plants as compared to the mother plant, and then evaluating relationships of these properties in the two superior Iranian landraces of cumin.

1: Introduction
0: The majority of  Mentha species are considered as medicinal and aromatic plants and are also known to possess several biological and pharmacological properties, primarily due to their essential oils (EOs) contents [ 1,  2].
1: A total of ten  Mentha species have been reported in the flora of Morocco [ 3], two of which,  M. suaveolens subsp.
2: timija and  M. gattefossei, being endemic.
3: M. suaveolens subsp.
4: timija (Briq.)
5: Harley (locally called  timija) is a perennial herb that finds natural habitat in semiarid and subhumid areas along rivers [ 3].
6: In Moroccan folk medicine, the powder and infusion of aerial parts of this plant are also used for the treatment of whooping cough, bronchitis, and ulcerative colitis and are known for their antispasmodic and carminative properties [ 4].
7: On the other hand, it has been reported that the EOs isolated from the aerial parts of mint timija exhibit a variety of biological activities including antimicrobial [ 5], antioxidant, and insecticidal activities [ 6,  7].
0: Mint timija, as with other aromatic and medicinal plants, is frequently collected from its natural habitat.
1: Unfortunately, it has been reported that overharvesting is causing a dramatic reduction in the natural populations of this endemic plant and increases its extinction risk [ 8].
2: Our previous study concluded that cultivation may constitute a rational solution to the management, conservation, and sustainable exploitation of this valuable medicinal plant [ 5].
3: However, it has been observed that this practice has increased the amount of pulegone in the EO extracted from mint timija.
4: This compound at higher doses is known for its toxicity and its dangerous effects to human health [ 9].
5: Indeed, it has been shown that the toxicity of pulegone is mainly due to its transformation into menthofuran, considered as a violent toxin against the lungs and liver [ 10].
0: It is well known that many factors and practices related to cultivation can improve the growth and EO quality of many aromatic plants [ 11].
1: Among these practices, application of mineral and biological fertilizers, such as N, P, and K amendments and mycorrhizal inoculation have been recommended [ 12,  13].
2: In fact, the use of these cultural practices has many advantages, which include promoting the physical and biological properties of soil [ 14], stimulating plant growth and biomass yield through improving nutrient uptake [ 15], and enhancing the content and quality of EOs via modulation of the levels of enzymes that participate in the biosynthesis of volatile terpenes [ 16].
0: Several studies have shown that the application of mineral fertilizers and biological agents, such as vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae (VAM), can influence the yield, composition, and biological properties of many medicinal and aromatic plants EOs, such as  Mentha piperita,  Mentha viridis,  Mentha arvensis,  Artemisia annua,  Rosmarinus officinalis,  Thymus maroccanus, and  Thymus leptobotrys [ 12,  17 21].
1: However, no information is available on the influence of these treatments on the quality and quantity of EO in mint timija plants.
2: Thus, the objective of the study described herein was to determine for the first time the possible effect of complete (N, P, and K) fertilizer and VAM inoculation on the chemical profile, and consequently on the insecticidal and antioxidant activities of EOs extracted from this Moroccan endemic plant.

1: Introduction
0: Species belonging to the  Protium genus (Burseraceae) produce a characteristic fragrant oleoresin with economic, medicinal, and cultural values [ 1,  2].
1: In the Brazilian Amazon region, these oleoresins are known as  breu, breu-branco (white-tar), and  breu-preto (black-tar) [ 3 5].
2: Breu oleoresins are a combination of two fractionsa volatile fraction that is mainly composed of mono- and sesquiterpenes and a solid nonvolatile fraction that is mainly composed of triterpenesand have a complex chemical composition with varying concentrations of each component responsible for  breu therapeutic activities [ 6 9].
3: Despite traditional communities' belief that there is a difference between white and black  breu, we have demonstrated that it is difficult to establish this nomenclature based on chemical, botanical, or regional names [ 5].
4: This traditional classification is probably associated with the darkening of the oleoresin caused by volatilization of select components and/or oxidation of others [ 5].
5: Among the mono and sesquiterpenes that characterize the volatile  breu fractions, some present antimicrobial, antioxidant [ 10], analgesic [ 11], anti-inflammatory, and antitumor [ 12] activities.
6: Because of its high sensorial quality,  breu essential oil is also used as a fragrance in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries [ 13].
0: In March 2012, our research group embarked on an expedition to the  quilombola territories along the Erepecuru River (Oriximina, Brazil) in search of different  breu trees and oleoresins to collect, analyze, and understand their use by the  quilombolas.
1: This journey was called The Malungo Expedition [ 5].
2: Quilombola communities (descendants of African slaves) from Oriximina, in the State of Para, Brazil, use  breu in their popular medicine to treat headaches and migraines by burning and inhaling the smoke produced during its combustion [ 14,  15].
3: It can also be used as a nasal decongestant by inhalation for severe colds [ 16,  17] as well as a topical treatment for contusions and inflammation and can be administered as a patch [ 18,  19] for colds, coughs, and bronchitis [ 3].
4: Furthermore,  breu is employed for mystical, spiritual [ 16,  19,  20], and superstitious purposes [ 21] as well as for caulking boats [ 14,  20].
0: Since The Malungo Expedition [ 5], our group has been interested in evaluating the traditional uses of  breu resins as a remedy for headaches and migraines by inhalation of the smoke produced during its combustion, but a literature search for pharmacological animals models resulted in no validated studies.
1: Several pharmacological models of pain involve inflammatory mediators.
2: We selected the formalin-induced licking model to evaluate inflammatory pain.
3: This model also involves direct activation of nociceptors (via C-fibers).
4: According to the  quilombola tradition, the  breu oleoresin is burned to generate smoke, which is inhaled.
5: In this procedure, some of the original  breu compounds may undergo pyrolysis reactions and some are simply transferred to the vapor phase and therefore inhaled without a chemical change.
6: In the inhalation model developed for this study, we only tested the volatile fractions of the oleoresins because they had been fully characterized in previous work from our group.
7: The present study was designed to explore the form of administration performed by the  quilombolas and to investigate whether the compounds in  breu essential oils, when included in an inhalation formulation, could produce a pharmacological response in  in vivo antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory models.
8: In addition, the sedative activity of these formulations was also evaluated to exclude a possible relationship with the observed pharmacological effects.
0: INTRODUCTION
0: Using medicinal plants to treat coincides with a human life history.
1: Natural remedies, especially herbal drugs, have been considered as the basis and even in some cases the only method of treatment.
2: [ 1] The use of this treatment method has a history of all civilizations and is an important component in the development of common medical science.
3: Although, in the past half century, the use of chemical and synthetic drugs has become extremely popular, their side effects made re-orientation to medicinal plants.
4: It is well known that the uses of medicinal plants have been historically one of the effective treatment methods.
5: Although plants have always been and are regarded as a valuable resource for humans, enough scientific investigations have not been done on them, and there are still largely unknown plants in the world.
6: Consequently, there are thousands of new unknown compounds in nature that can be used not only as drugs but also as a leader to make other synthetic drugs.
7: [ 23] One of these plants is  Echinophora on which there are some studies with promising results in the literature for treatment of various diseases.
8: This study aimed to review the botanical, phytochemistry, and pharmacology properties of steel  Echinophora species in Iran.
0: Echinophora genus belongs to  Umbelliferae or  Apiaceae, and in Persian, it is known with the names  Khosharizeh,  Khosharuzeh, or  Tighe Turagh.
1: It is an aromatic plant with a pleasant flavor, which, in addition to its numerous food consumption, has medicinal uses.
2: [ 45]
0: Echinophora genus has several species including  Echinophora carvifolia Boiss.

1: Introduction
0: For centuries, herb plants are used as a source of medicine.
1: World Health Organization (WHO) reports that the world's population resort to folk medicine for their primary healthcare needs [ 1].
2: In this context, natural products, such as plant extracts, either as pure compounds or as standardized extracts, provide unlimited opportunities for new drug discoveries [ 2].
3: Also, vegetable materials are used from ancient time as source of flavoring, beverages, fragrances, and cosmetics products.
4: This is because the plant materials have unique properties to synthesize biologically active compounds resulted as metabolites from their so-called secondary metabolism [ 3].
5: Between the four major classes of bioactive secondary metabolites (terpenes, phenolics, glycosides, and alkaloids), the phenolic compounds (derived from secondary metabolism of the aromatic amino acids) have antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, and antimutagenic activities, being of particular importance for human health [ 4].
6: They are also known to decrease cardiovascular risks [ 5].
7: Epidemiological studies demonstrated the ability of plant polyphenols to offer protection against development of cancers, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, osteoporosis, and neurodegenerative diseases [ 6].
8: The phenolic groups in polyphenols accept an electron to form relatively stable phenoxyl radicals, disrupting chain oxidation reactions in cellular components [ 7].
9: Phenolics represent a large variety of compounds such as simple phenols, phenolic acids, coumarins, flavonoids, stilbenes, hydrolysable and condensed tannins, lignans, and lignins [ 8].
10: It should be noted that flavonoids represent one of the most important natural phenols.
11: Another important class of compounds occurring in plant materials is represented by terpenoids, which play an essential role in development of living systems.
12: Most of them are volatile substances and are generally present in the essential oil obtained by extractive methods.
0: Not just perennial but also cultured plants are studied in terms of their pharmacological properties.
1: Between cultured plants, the decorative species of  Rudbeckia are present in particular or public gardens.
2: Native to North America,  Rudbeckia is a flowering plant of the family Asteraceae, found in 25 different perennial, annual, or biennial species.
3: The most common varieties of this plant are  Rudbeckia fulgida,  Rudbeckia hirta,  Rudbeckia laciniata, or  Rudbeckia triloba.
4: This last one was reported in Austria in the 1970s, while in Romania, it has been encountered for the first time in Maramures and Neamt counties [ 9].
0: Few studies on biochemical properties of  Rudbeckia varieties are reported [ 10].
1: Thus, leaf essential oils from three herbaceous members of the Asteraceae family,  Rudbeckia fulgida,  Rudbeckia hirta, and  Symphyotrichum novae-angliae, were obtained by hydrodistillation and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
2: The main components in the essential oil of  Rudbeckia fulgida were found to be the sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (germacrene D (30.1%) and -cadinene (17.8%)); similar composition was reported in the case of leaf oil of  Rudbeckia hirta, with 23.6% germacrene D and 16.2% -cadinene.
3: The leaf oils of these extracts were found to be inactive for antimicrobial activity [ 11].
4: Another study reports the chemical composition, minerals, and antioxidative effect of  Rudbeckia laciniata [ 12].
5: General component of  Rudbeckia laciniata is crude protein.
6: The highest content of minerals is potassium, followed by calcium and magnesium, suggesting that  Rudbeckia laciniata was alkaline material.
7: The content of total phenolic and flavonoid compounds and DPPH radical scavenging activity of  Rudbeckia laciniata were also reported.
8: The chemical profile of  Rudbeckia hirta was established by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) technique and by means of the total content of polyphenols [ 13].
9: As about the therapeutic actions of the species of the genus  Rudbeckia, they are relatively varied.
10: The active compounds or extracts of these plants exhibit anti-inflammatory effects ( Rudbeckia hirta) [ 14,  15], antimycobacterial ( Rudbeckia subtomentosa) [ 16], antileukemic ( Rudbeckia mollis) [ 17], antitussive ( Rudbeckia fulgida) [ 18], antioxidant, antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, and cytotoxic activities ( Rudbeckia laciniata) [ 19].
0: To the best of our knowledge, no study has reported in literature on the chemical composition and antioxidant activity of  Rudbeckia triloba.
1: In this paper, different aerial parts of the  Rudbeckia triloba were used to obtain essential oil, infusion, decoct, and hydroalcoholic macerate.
2: The solid plant materials (dried leaves and inflorescences), the essential oil of dried inflorescences, and the obtained aqueous or hydroalcoholic extracts from dried petals, leaves, and seeds were characterized by chromatographic or/and spectrophotometric methods.

0: INTRODUCTION
0: It is a well known fact that nutrition is an issue of both quantity and quality of food that contains essential nutrients for normal body functions.
1: Vegetables and fruits in all their forms ensure an adequate intake of most essential nutrients and vitamins, dietary fibers, and phytochemicals which can supply the much-needed measure of balance diets thereby contributing to solve many of the nutritional problems.
2: They also play an important role in human nutrition and health particularly as sources of vitamin C, niacin, pyridoxine, folic acid, thiamine, minerals and dietary fibre [ 1].
3: Scientific evidence shows that frequent consumption of vegetables and fruits can prevent oesophageal, stomach, pancreatic, bladder and cervical cancers and that a diet high in fruits and vegetables could prevent 20% of most types of cancer [ 2].
0: Since good nutrition is a basic human right, there is a need for the exploitation of available local resources in order to satisfy the needs of the increasing population in developing countries which is characterized by abject poverty.
1: Studies on wild edible fruits and vegetables indicate that they are good sources of human nutrition, since they contain the essential minerals and vitamins in addition to proteins, fibres, fats and carbohydrate which are very significant for healthy growth and development of human body.
0: Blood plum ( Haematostaphis barteri) is a wild edible vegetable belonging to the  Anacardiaceae family.
1: It is a perennial tree crop which normally grows wildly in the forest and usually among savannah [ 3].
2: The tree is found wild in Borno and Adamawa [ 4], and Taraba States of Nigeria, and it is known as Jinin Kafiri in Hausa language.
3: The leaves of blood plum are used for seasoning soup in some local government areas of Adamawa and Taraba states as well as animal feed.
4: It is also used in nursing the snake bite victims, therefore, the plant bark is also used in treating liver, gall bladder, spleen disorders and jaundice, whereas the wood is used as firewood [ 5].
5: The  H. barteri fruit has oily seed which is edible [ 4].
0: Due to the increasing incidence of diet related diseases such as obesity, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases in particular, the study is aimed at analyzing the fatty acid composition, phospholipid and phytosterol contents as well as some physicochemical parameters of pulp and seed of  Haematostaphis barteri, with a view to providing information regarding effective utilization of the plants pulp and seed in various foods and with the possibility of industrial applications.
0: Introduction
0: Prolonged inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis, atherosclerosis, chronic hepatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory brain diseases (Chung et al., 2007[ 7]).
1: Inflammation is caused by pro-inflammatory mediators, including both pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-6, and pro-inflammatory factors such as nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 (Ljung et al., 2006[ 24]; Walsh et al., 2005[ 39]).
2: Therefore, inhibition of these inflammatory mediators is an important target pathway in the treatment of diseases with anti-inflammatory components.
0: Nuclear transcription factor kappa-B (NF-B) regulates a variety of genes associated with immune and acute-phase inflammatory responses.
1: The activation of NF-B due to pro-inflammatory stimulation is indicated by rapid phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitors of kappa B (IBs) (Rajapakse et al., 2008[ 30]).
2: Freed NF-B dimers from this process translocate to the nucleus and bind to the promoter regions of target genes (Lee et al., 2003[ 21]).
3: They then induce the transcription of pro-inflammatory mediators such as iNOS, COX-2, IL-6, IL-1, and TNF- (Makarov, 2000[ 25]; Yoshimura, 2006[ 44]).
4: Recent studies have reported that the anti-inflammatory effect of phytochemicals occurs through blocking of the NF-B signaling pathway (Ham et al., 2015[ 11]; Hsieh et al., 2011[ 14]).
5: Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are one of the major kinases involved in cellular processes such as apoptosis, stress responses, differentiation, and immune defense (Liu et al., 2007[ 23]).
6: MAPKs comprise three major subgroups, namely, p38 MAPKs, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs).
7: Their activation plays an important role in the expression of iNOS and COX-2 and in the production of cytokines (Rajapakse et al., 2008[ 30]; Rao, 2001[ 31]).
8: Therefore, MAPK and NF-B may be effective as anti-inflammatory agents.
0: Lindera erythrocarpa is widely distributed in the Republic of Korea, Japan, and China (Sun and Chung, 1988[ 35]).
1: Lindera species, including  L. strychnifolia,  L. lucida,  L. chunii, and  L. aggregate are important medicinal plants.
2: The fruit and leaves of  L. erythrocarpa are used in folk medicine for treating digestive disorders, thirst, pain, and neuralgia.
3: They are also used as antidotes and diuretics (Hong et al., 2009[ 13]; Oh et al., 2005[ 28]; Sun and Chung, 1988[ 35]).
4: Recently,  L. erythrocarpa was reported to suppress adipogenesis and melanin synthesis, attenuate obesity, as well as exhibit antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antifungal activities (Hsieh and Wang, 2013[ 15]; Hwang et al., 2007[ 16]; Kumar et al., 2010[ 19]; Wang et al., 2008[ 40]).
5: Essential oils extracted from medicinal and aromatic plants are known to have biological effects, most notably anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antifungal, and antibacterial activities (Chaieb et al., 2007[ 4]; Pinheiro et al., 2011[ 29]).
6: These properties are a driving interest in the use of essential oils in the cosmetic, pharmaceutical, and food industries (Chaieb et al., 2007[ 4]; Lang and Buchbauer, 2012[ 20]; Tumen et al., 2010[ 37]).
7: However, the mechanism by which  L. erythrocarpa essential oil (LEO) exerts its anti-inflammatory effect has not been elucidated.
8: Therefore, in this study, we examined the anti-inflammatory effects of LEO and its constituents on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells.
0: Introduction
0: The recent boom in unconventional oil and gas production from shale has revolutionized the energy landscape in the United States 1 and stimulated both considerable research 2  5 as well as environmental and political concerns.
1: Shale is a fine-grained sedimentary rock, composed of solid organic matter (OM) scattered in a mineral framework.
2: This solid OM is the source of petroleum, as the OM breaks down into oil and gas under high temperatures during a process known as maturation.
3: The solid OM remaining after maturation develops a network of nanoscale pores responsible for hydrocarbon storage and transport during petroleum production and migration over geologic time 6  8.
4: Additionally, OM partially controls shales geomechanical properties as it is the softest component, affecting both fracturing efficiency and flow of petroleum to the wellbore 9.
5: Therefore, investigation of geochemical and geomechanical properties of OM in shale is important for building robust geological models to access unconventional resources and enhance hydrocarbon production efficiency.
0: Solid OM in shale is typically highly heterogeneous at the submicron length scale.
1: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has shown that adjacent micron-sized OM grains sometimes differ greatly in porosity 10.
2: This heterogeneity can result from innate differences in the OM originally deposited in the shale and potentially from local variations in the extent of thermal alteration brought on by catalysis from nearby mineral grains.
3: While SEM provides detailed, high-resolution information on pores in OM, it provides no information on the type, chemical composition, or mechanical properties of that OM.
4: Organic petrography via incident light microscopy allows the identification of various types of organic components and has been broadly applied to shale petroleum systems 11, but again this technique provides no direct molecular or mechanical data.
5: Numerous bulk measurements, such as programmed pyrolysis (Rock-Eval) and various spectroscopies 12 including infrared spectroscopy 13,  14, have documented dramatic variations in the average chemical composition of OM across a wide maturation range, but these bulk analyses cannot assess heterogeneity at small spatial scales.
6: Progress toward documenting geochemical heterogeneity in shale has been realized by application of Fourier transform infrared microscopy (micro-FTIR) 15  19.
7: Nevertheless, micro-FTIR cannot reliably resolve chemical features at the submicron length scale relevant to shale due to the diffraction limit 17,  19,  20.
8: Alternatively, Raman imaging provides structural information on the degree of organization of OM at the micron length scale but suffers from strong fluorescence background for immature shale samples 21  23.
9: Geomechanical heterogeneity in shale has been studied by nanoindentation at the micron length scale 24,  25 and by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in peak force tapping mode at nanoscale 26,  27, but these techniques provide no information regarding chemical composition.
0: AFM-based infrared spectroscopy (AFM-IR) is a rapidly emerging technique in materials and life sciences 28  34 that provides chemical and mechanical stiffness mapping at nanoscale unaffected by the diffraction limit, in additional to topographic imaging by AFM.
1: During the measurement, an AFM probe with tip radius smaller than 25 nm is placed in contact with an area of interest simultaneously irradiated with a tunable IR laser 29.
2: When the laser wavelength is tuned to an infrared absorption band of the sample material, the sample thermally expands as the energy of absorbed photons is converted to heat.
3: That thermal expansion acts as a force impulse on the AFM cantilever, driving it into oscillation.
4: Oscillation amplitude is directly proportional to the local IR absorption coefficient at the IR wavelength at which the sample is irradiated.
5: Because the AFM tip remains in contact with the sample, the contact resonance (CR) frequency of the coupled sample-cantilever system provides information about the samples mechanical stiffness, with higher frequency corresponding to stiffer materials and lower to softer materials (quantitatively translating the measured CR frequency to stiffness requires extensive modeling of the mechanical response of the cantilever to the photothermal expansion of the sample, so stiffness in AFM-IR measurements is typically described using the CR frequency) 28  30.
6: Thus, at a fixed laser wavelength, IR absorption and stiffness images can be collected simultaneously by recording the AFM cantilever oscillation amplitude and frequency.
7: The spatial resolution is independent of the IR laser spot size, thus no longer limited by diffraction, but instead determined by the contact area between the probe and the sample as well as by the samples thermomechanical properties 28  31,  35.
8: The typical spatial resolution of the resulting chemical image is ~100 nm 28  31,  35, orders of magnitude finer than the spatial resolution attainable by traditional micro-FTIR.
9: Additionally, localized IR spectra can be obtained by measuring the AFM oscillation amplitude while tuning the IR laser wavelength.
10: The resulting local IR absorption spectra are nearly identical to those measured with bulk transmission FTIR 28  31,  35, providing information on chemical composition and structural characteristics.
0: In this study, we demonstrate the first application of AFM-IR in the earth sciences.
1: This technique is used to provide direct, in situ, simultaneous geochemical and geomechanical characterization of individual dispersed OM particles at nanoscale.
2: The AFM-IR images are correlated with optical microscopy images to analyze chemical and mechanical properties of macerals (optically discernible organic constituents) in a New Albany Shale sample.
3: To understand the impacts of maturation on nanoscale OM composition, similar measurements are performed on a series of samples prepared to different stages of maturation by laboratory hydrous pyrolysis.
4: This approach allows evaluation of compositional and mechanical variations among different macerals and unravels the chemical evolution of different macerals with increasing maturity.
5: Beyond the bulk picture provided by conventional analysis, this approach of following compositional and mechanical evolution of individual macerals at the relevant length scale during maturation provides a microscopic picture of the heterogeneous process of petroleum generation.
0: Introduction
0: Rosmarinus officinalis L., commonly known as rosemary, is a woody, perennial herb with fragrant, evergreen, needle-like leaves native to the Mediterranean region.
1: Rosemarys antioxidant properties are still used to extend the shelf life of prepared foods  1  3 .
2: Rosemary is also known medicinally for its powerful antioxidant activity and antibacterial properties  4 and as a chemopreventive agent  5 .
3: Today, essential oil of rosemary is widely used in the cosmetic industry producing various bathing essences, hair lotions and shampoos  6 .
0: Traditional methods used for extraction of essential oil were Hydro-distillation (HD) or steam distillation.
1: However, the loss of some components and the degradation of some unsaturated compounds by thermal effects  7,  8 or by hydrolysis can take place by these conventional extraction techniques.
2: These disadvantages have changed the approach of the recent research and stimulated the intensification, optimization and improvement of existing and novel green extraction techniques  9,  10 .
3: Some of these methods are: Ultrasound-Assisted Extraction, Microwave-Assisted Extraction and CO   2  supercritical extraction.
4: The supercritical fluid extraction of rosemary with CO   2  has been the object of many researches  11 and has become a valid alternative to the more conventional extraction procedures, mainly because the dissolving power of the extracting medium can be adjusted by regulating pressure and temperature conditions.
5: However, the high cost of producing specific products has limited its use.
6: In certain cases, the extractive power of supercritical CO   2  is insufficient under conventional conditions.
7: Microwave-assisted solvent extraction appeared to be particularly attractive for isolation of essential oil  12,  13 .
8: Microwave-assisted Hydro-distillation (MAHD) combines rapid heating in the microwave field with the traditional solvent extraction.
9: This significantly enables saving of time, so the extraction can be completed in meter of minutes  14,  15 .
10: In an attempt to take advantage of microwave heating with the conventional HD, MAHD was developed and used for the extraction of essential oils from  Xylopia aromatica (Lamarck) and  Lippia alba (Mill)  16,  17 .
0: Tigrine-Kordjani  et al18 developed a Microwave Assisted Distillation (MAD) with free solvent for laboratory scale applications in the extraction of essential oils from different kinds of aromatic plant.
1: Sui  et al19 have worked on an efficient Microwave Pretreatment (MP) method to maintain quality of postharvest rosemary leaves and observed that MP could be a good method for extracting essential oil and maintaining quality in rosemary and other aromatic herbs.
2: Lucchesi  et al20 had a study on comparing solvent-free microwave extraction of essential oil from aromatic herbs with conventional hydro-distillation.
3: They found that the SFME method yields an essential oil with higher amounts of more valuable oxygenated compounds, and allows substantial savings of costs, in terms of time, energy and plant material.
4: SFME is a green technology and appears as a good alternative for the extraction of essential oils from aromatic plants.
0: In this paper, the essential oil from rosemary obtained by microwave hydro-distillation has been compared with those obtained by conventional hydrodistillation.
1: Then, the quality and quantity of essential oil, cost, energy consumption and safety environmental consideration of two methods were studied.
2: Also, different parameters on essential oil extraction quantity and quality were checked.The aim of this research was finding an optimum method for extraction of essential oil.
0: Background
0: Osmanthus fragrans, also known as sweet olive or fragrant olive, is one of the most famous flowers in China due to attractive color and strong fragrance.

0: Essential oil is the volatile oil extracted from plants with strong aromatic components and distinctive odour, which has been widely used as a major raw material of perfume or cosmetic [ 9].
1: The essential oil is an excellent source of bioactive compounds, and exhibits various activities such as antioxidant and antimicrobial effects [ 10].
2: Therefore, it is considered to be partly responsible for the biomedical functions of plants [ 11].
3: Previous reports about  O. fragrans var.

6: However, the main active ingredients and bioactivities of this essential oil were still not fully elucidated.
0: One of the main causes for difficulties in the bioactivity study of  O. fragrans var.
1: thunbergii essential oil is the complexity of its chemical composition.
2: Recently, complex network approach has emerged in the pharmacological researches, which was also known as network pharmacology or system pharmacology [ 14,  15].
3: This methodology holds a significant potential for extracting biological information from large amounts of chemical data [ 16], and enables to predict the target profiles and pharmacological actions of herbal compounds [ 17,  18].

1: Introduction
0: Terpenes are the largest and most diverse family of natural products.
1: Within these compounds both primary metabolites (hormones, carotenoids, chlorophylls and sterols), necessary for plant growth and survival, and secondary metabolites, that are not directly involved in growth and/or development, can be found [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
2: The latter compounds have also considerable commercial importance due to their uses in food, perfume, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries [ 6, 7, 8, 9].
0: All terpenes originate from the universal C5 precursor IPP and its isomer DMAPP.
1: In plants, both compounds are formed through two pathways [ 10, 11]: the cytosolic MVA pathway, which comprises several enzymatic reactions from acetyl coenzymeA condensation through mevalonate iphosphate decarboxylation, and the plastidial MEP pathway starting from the reaction between pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate ( Figure 1).
0: The MVA pathway is primarily regulated at the level of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (HMGR) [ 1, 12], and it is known that HMGR activity regulates the metabolic flux through the MVA pathway and the eventual production of the isoprenoid end-products [ 13, 14].
1: The scenario seems to be more complex in the case of the MEP pathway.
2: In fact, the MEP pathway can be regulated by several enzymes, including 1-deoxy- d-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) synthase (DXS), DXP reductoisomerase (DXR) [ 15] and hydroxymethyl-butenyl 4-diphosphate (HMBPP) reductase (HDR) [ 13, 15, 16].
0: Generally, it is assumed that the MVA pathway is responsible for providing precursors for the synthesis of sesquiterpenes and triterpenes, while the MEP pathway donates precursors for monoterpenes, diterpenes and tetraterpenes [ 17].
1: Although both pathways are thought to operate independently under normal conditions, interactions between them have been repeatedly reported [ 18].
2: Thus, experiments with labelled products and/or treatments with specific inhibitors (mevinoline and fosmidomycin that respectively block the MVA and MEP pathways) illustrate that the compartmental division between the two pathways is not complete since common metabolites from both pathways can be exchanged, in both directions, through the plastidial membrane [ 11, 19, 20].
3: Therefore, the relative contribution of the MVA and MEP pathways for the biosynthesis of plant terpenes and the factors controlling this distribution especially under physiological conditions of growing plants remain uncertain for each plant species.
4: It is still assumed, however, that monoterpenes are primarily synthesized in the plastids via the MEP pathway-derived IPP and DMAPP [ 21].
0: Spike lavender ( Lavandula latifolia Medicus) is an aromatic shrub of high economic importance due to its essential oil, composed mainly of monoterpenes [ 22].
1: The main constituents in spike lavender oil from flowers are the monoterpenes linalool, cineole and camphor, while the main constituents in the oil from leaves are cineole and camphor [ 23].
2: All monoterpenes are derived from geranyl diphosphate molecule (GPP).
3: In the case of camphor, GPP is transformed via cyclisation of linaloyl pyrophosphate into bornyl pyrophosphate, followed by a hydrolysis reaction that produces borneol, which finally is oxidized to camphor.
4: In the case of cineole, the GPP intermediate is first converted into -terpineol by the -terpineol synthase and this monoterpene is converted into cineole by the cineole synthase [ 24] ( Figure 2).
0: Due to its high economic interest, the composition and quality of spike lavender oil has been widely studied including chemical composition of essential oil from some Spanish wild populations [ 26, 27, 28, 29].
1: All these studies revealed a great intraspecific variability in the chemical composition of oils that can be attributed to several variation sources: genotypic, climatic, geographical and/or seasonal [ 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33].
0: Modifications of yield and composition of the spike lavender essential oil by genetic engineering may have important scientific and commercial applications.
1: Until now, three genes involved in the first steps of the synthesis of terpenes have been overexpressed in spike lavender, the  Arabidopsis HMG1, DXS and DXR genes, encoding the respective HMGR1S, DXS and DXR enzymes.
2: As expected, the overexpression of the DXS gene produced a significant increase of the end-product monoterpenes derived from an elevated supply of precursors of the MEP isoprenoid pathway without affecting the chlorophyll and carotenoid content [ 34].
3: Surprisingly, the overexpression of the DXR enzyme did not lead to an increase of monoterpenes or photosynthetic pigments [ 35].
4: In contrast, the overexpression of the HMG1 gene from  Arabidopsis, led to an increased yield of essential oil since transgenic T0 plants accumulated significantly more essential oil constituents as compared to controls (up to 2.1- and 1.8-fold in leaves and flowers, respectively).
5: These transgenic plants also increased its amount of the end-product sterols, -sitosterol and stigmasterol (average differences of 1.8- and 1.9-fold, respectively), but did not accumulate more carotenoids or chlorophylls as compared to controls.
6: The potential of the mevalonate pathway for enhanced isoprenoid production by upregulation of HMGR and other enzymes of the pathway as well as its interaction with the MEP pathway have been updated recently [ 36].
7: The increased levels of essential oil and sterols observed in the transgenic T0 plants were maintained in the progeny that inherited the HMG1 transgene.
8: Therefore, genetic manipulation of the MVA pathway also increases essential oil yield in spike lavender, suggesting a contribution for this cytosolic pathway to monoterpene and sesquiterpene biosynthesis in leaves and flowers of the species [ 37].
0: The incorporation of  13C- or  14C-labelled tracer compounds into the current metabolism is one of the most powerful tools to determine the metabolites biosynthetic pathways.
1: To study primary and secondary metabolism in plants, general precursors (e.g., glucose) or more specific intermediates can be used as tracers and supplied to plant tissues maintained either in vitro (e.g., plant cell cultures, stem or leave cultures, seedlings) [ 38, 39] or ex vitro [ 39].
2: By studying the presence and distribution of the labelled atoms in the final products, it is possible to reconstruct the metabolic pathways followed [ 39].
0: The use of  13CO 2 as a tracer is a powerful tool, since this strategy represents the possibility of studying metabolic pathways in plants by mimicking, as much as possible, their physiological growth conditions [ 40, 41, 42].
1: The labelling period (pulse) is followed by a chase period in which the plants grow under normal conditions and natural  13CO 2 abundance for several hours/days.
2: During that time, unlabeled products and intermediates are produced, that also are used in the production of the final metabolites.
3: Therefore, complex patterns of [ 12C]- and [ 13C]-isotopologues are expected to be found in the final natural products.
4: The analysis of complex isotopologue mixtures in  13CO 2-labelled natural products became possible recently, because of the remarkable improvement made in NMR and mass spectrometry techniques [ 40, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46].
5: 13CO 2 feeding has also been used to measure plastidic DMAPP concentrations and to quantify the  de novo production of volatile and nonvolatile isoprenoids in some species [ 47].
6: In this paper, we describe the  13CO 2 labelling conditions necessary to study the incorporation of  13CO 2 into cineole and camphor in wild type (WT) and HMGR5 transgenic spike lavender plants.
7: The results are aimed to clarify the possible contribution of the MVA pathway to the biosynthesis of both monoterpenes in the species.

1: Introduction
0: Medicinal plants have been used for a long time as sources of new pharmaceuticals due to the presence of bioactive compounds [ 1].
1: Plants are rich in structurally diverse secondary metabolites displaying a wide range of biological activities, including possible leads for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases [ 2, 3].
2: Natural products have contributed greatly as sources for drug discovery for Alzheimers disease [ 4].
3: Earlier studies have shown that the maintenance of correct levels of acetylcholinesterases is directly related to different diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), bipolar disorder, depression, and schizophrenia [ 5].
4: There are two distinct basic types of cholinesterases: acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE).
5: The main physiological function of AChE is the splitting of acetylcholine (ACh), a mediator of cholinergic synapses, during the transduction of nerve impulses [ 6].
0: AD is a prevalent disease that affects more than 26 million people globally, and is the most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide [ 7].
1: AChE inhibitors (AChEIs) have medical applications and are particularly important for the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimers disease [ 8].
2: The butyrylcholinesterase enzyme (BChE) is synthesized in the liver and its main function is to hydrolyze hydrophobic and hydrophilic carboxylic or phosphoric acid ester containing compounds.
3: Its toxicological and pharmacological importance becomes clear when an individual is exposured to poisonous compounds targeting the acetylcholine binding sites.
4: When there is a hepatic alteration, its concentration decreases in direct relation with the altered hepatocytes [ 9, 10].
0: The anti-AChE activity of the essential oils of  Eryngium campestre and  Eryngium amethystine, two species of the Apiaceae family, is described in the work conducted by Cianfaglione et al.
1: [ 11], showing that the inhibitory activity is very low (10.5% at 19.5 mg/mL) compared to the commercial inhibitor galanthamine.
2: The activity was expressed as galanthamine equivalent inhibitory activity and the dose tested is similar to an inhibition exerted by 3 g/mL of the positive control galanthamine.
3: Likewise, the essential oil of  Daucus aristidis (Apiaceae) tested against AChE and BChE enzymes, by the Ellman method, at a concentration of 100 g/mL appeared to have a moderate level of inhibitory effect (between 13% to 50%) against both enzymes as compared to that of galanthamine.
4: The moderate AChE inhibitory activity of  Daucus aristidis essential oil could be explained by the highest concentration of its individual components, - and -pinene (over 70%) [ 12].
0: Species belonging to the Apiaceae family such as cumin, coriander, carrot, celery, and parsley are considered foods or spices; however, some of them contain highly toxic substances [ 13].

1: Introduction
0: In recent years, the increasing demand for pharmaceutical and cosmetic products based on natural active ingredients has brought researchers to focus their attention on essential oils (EOs).
1: Traditionally, EOs have been used as fragrances in food and cosmetics but, in the last decades, many investigations have highlighted their numerous biological and medicinal properties, demonstrating their antioxidant, preservative, antimicrobial, antiviral, fungicidal, insecticidal, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, sedative and anticancer activities [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
0: EOs are volatile, lipophilic liquid or semiliquid, complex mixtures of low molecular weight organic compounds produced by plants as secondary metabolites whose main components consist of monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids, phenylpropanoids and short-chained aliphatics.
1: Due to the chemical structures of their constituents, EOs can be easily degraded after exposure to humidity, heat, oxygen and light, owing to chemical and enzymatic reactions (oxidation, isomerization, cyclization, and dehydrogenation), which may occur during the manufacturing and handling processes [ 8].
2: The presence of degradation products in EOs could impair their biological activity.
3: For example, topical application of EOs containing oxidized terpenoids may show skin-sensitizing effects, thus inducing allergic contact dermatitis [ 9, 10].
0: To overcome the drawbacks of EOs, such as high volatility, easy degradation, high lipophilicity and poor membrane permeability, several researchers have suggested the encapsulation of these active ingredients into nanocarriers [ 11].
0: Advantages, including the ability to incorporate lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs, controlled drug release, drug targeting, increased drug stability and bioavailability, safety, easy scale-up and low cost of production, have boosted the use of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) as nanocarriers for different administration routes [ 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17].
1: Recent investigations have revealed the usefulness of SLNs as carriers for EO delivery.
2: EOs from the genera  Boswellia and  Commiphora, exhibiting antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor activities, were efficiently loaded into SLNs designed for oral delivery, providing increased anticancer activity compared to free EOs [ 18].
3: Moghimipour et al.
4: [ 19] prepared SLNs encapsulating the essential oil extracted from the leaves of  Zataria multiflora and concluded that SLNs are suitable carriers for essential oils.
5: The same conclusion was reported in a study assessing SLNs loaded with  Nigella sativa essential oil [ 20].
6: Two different SLN formulations were investigated in vitro as carriers for the topical and transdermal delivery of  Artemisia arborescens essential oil [ 21].
7: This study pointed out the high physical stability of these formulations, along with their ability to target the essential oil to the skin layers, while retaining in vitro antiviral activity.
0: Rosemary ( Rosmarinus officinalis L.) essential oil has been attributed antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, fungicidal, and anticancer activity, mainly owing to its flavonoids and terpenes content [ 22, 23, 24, 25].
1: Investigations on rosemary aqueous extracts pointed out the antioxidant activity of this extract and its ability to control lipoperoxidation of skin lipids.
2: Therefore, rosemary aqueous extracts have been suggested as a useful tool for the prevention and treatment of skin disorders, including age-related skin damages [ 26].
3: However, to date, topical benefits of rosemary essential oil have not been clearly demonstrated.
0: In this work, we evaluated the effects on skin hydration and elasticity of rosemary essential oil after topical application via gel vehicles in human volunteers.
1: To improve its topical efficacy, rosemary essential oil was loaded into lipid nanoparticles, whose safety has been previously reported [ 27].
0: After a one-week topical treatment with gels containing two different percentages of rosemary EO-loaded lipid nanoparticles, a significant increase in skin hydration was observed in comparison with gels containing the same percentages of free rosemary EO.
1: Skin elasticity increased as well, although to a lesser extent.
2: These results suggest that the design of suitable lipid nanocarriers could be a successful approach to improve rosemary EO topical benefits.

1: Introduction
0: In the last few years, the emergence and growing accessibility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have allowed advances in the understanding of the composition and functional activity of the gut microbial community.
1: Approximately 100 papers on gut microbiota were published in 2007, whereas about 3000 such studies were published in 2016, and almost the same number to date in 2017 (research performed by setting the words gut and microbiota in October 2017 on PubMed and Scopus).
2: The importance of using NGS technology is due to the necessity of simultaneous analysis of a large amount of genetic material.
3: Indeed, overall, the gut microbiota is estimated to contain 150 times more genes than the human genome.
4: These genes have been estimated to belong to approximately 10 1310 14 microbes, with a species diversity of up to several hundred per individual [ 1].
5: However, The Human Microbiota Project and other studies have collectively found that thousands of different species may inhabit the human gut, pointing out the high degree of taxa variation in the microbiota composition of different populations.
6: Despite this variation, the human gut microbiota is characterized by some basic similarities.
7: Approximately 60% of the gut bacteria belong to the  Bacteroidetes and  Firmicutes phyla, and, among them,  Bifidobacterium,  Lactobacillus,  Bacteroides,  Clostridium,  Escherichia,  Streptococcus, and  Ruminococcus are the most commonly found genera in adults [ 2].
8: However, several factors influence the bacterial composition in taxa type and abundance, making the total gut microbiota profile host-specific in humans.
9: These factors include host phenotype, such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), lifestyle, and immune function; geographical belonging and environmental factors; use of antibiotics, drugs, and probiotics; and diet.
0: The causal relationship between the gut microbiota and overall pathological conditions is still unclear.
1: Indeed, it is still unclear whether a disease-prone microbial composition exists (so-called dysbiosis) or whether the changes in the microbial community occur after the onset of the disease [ 3].
2: Conversely, diet undoubtedly influences the composition of gut microbiota, providing nutrients for both the host and the bacteria.
3: This gut community has many degrading enzymes and metabolic capabilities that are able to break down macromolecules into smaller chemical compounds, which can then be uptaken by enterocytes [ 4].
4: Moreover, long-term dietary habits have been shown to play a crucial role in creating an inter-individual variation in microbiota composition [ 5].
5: However, despite the great number of publications on the effects of carbohydrates, the impacts of dietary fats and protein on the gut microbiota are less well defined.
6: In particular, gut microbiota changes associated with omega-3 fatty acids are poorly understood.
0: Among the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6) are the two main bioactive forms in humans.
1: These fatty acids can be synthesized from the dietary precursor and essential fatty acid, -linolenic acid (ALA, C18:3).
2: However, the synthesis pathway requires several elongation and desaturation chemical reactions, so that the conversion of the two active forms in mammals is less efficient than dietary uptake.
3: For this reason, consumption of EPA- and DHA-rich foods is recommended.
4: However, since foods rich in these fatty acids are not widespread, EPA and DHA are widely used as nutritional supplements, often as nutraceuticals.
5: Several papers have demonstrated the correlation between omega-3 PUFAs and the inflammatory response.
6: Although the literature on this topic is discordant, omega-3 PUFAs are generally associated with anti-inflammatory effects, in comparison with the omega-6 PUFAs that are linked to pro-inflammatory effects, due to the different downstream lipid metabolites [ 6].
7: Also, with regards to the link to immunity, studies have shown that the supplementation of omega-3 PUFAs provides multiple health benefits against different chronic degenerative diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases [ 7], rheumatoid arthritis [ 8], inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [ 9], depression [ 10], and cancer [ 11].
0: Considering the few insights existing in literature, in the present review, we assessed whether omega-3 PUFAs have an impact on the composition of the human gut microbiota in adults and infants.
1: Moreover, a connection of this topic to inflammation and behavioral disorders was completed.
0: Background
0: Reactive oxygen species (ROSs) are various forms of activated oxygen.
1: A disproportion of the reactive oxygen species and the absence of their scavenge systems in cells lead to oxidative stress and increases the risk of several human chronic diseases [ 1].
2: ROS contributes to the development of various diseases such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, liver cirrhosis and the aging process [ 2].
3: The liver plays a central role in the maintenance of systemic lipid homeostasis and is especially susceptible to ROS damage.
4: CCl 4 is now of greatest concern as an environmental contaminant [ 3].
5: It was reported that CCl 4 was one of the most commonly used toxins in the experimental study of liver diseases [ 4].
6: Abraham et al.
7: [ 5] showed that the nephrotoxic effects of CCl 4 were also associated with free radical production.
0: To prevent the damage caused by ROS, living organisms have developed an antioxidant defense system that includes the presence of non-enzymatic antioxidants and enzymes such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) [ 6].
1: It has been anticipated that in addition to these natural antioxidants, other synthetic or natural ROS scavengers may reduce the incidence of free radical-mediated diseases.
2: The use of antioxidants in the prevention and cure of various diseases is intensifying, and there is considerable interest in the study of the antioxidant activities of molecules such as plant polyphenolic and carotenoid components [ 6,  7].
3: Antioxidants appear to act against disease processes by increasing the levels of endogenous antioxidant enzymes and decreasing lipid peroxidation [ 8].
0: A number of studies showed that various herbal extracts could protect liver and kidney against CCl 4-induced oxidative stress by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and enhancing antioxidant enzyme activity [ 9].
1: Silymarin, a flavonolignan mixture of milk thistle ( Silybum marianum), is one such important herbal hepatoprotective drug.
2: Silymarin exhibits hepatoprotective effects by altering cytoplasmic membrane architecture and, in turn, preventing the penetration of hepatotoxic substances, such as carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4), thioacetamide and D-galactosamine [ 10].
0: The well-known and widely used peppermint ( Mentha piperita L.) (Lamiaceae) is a cultivated natural hybrid of  Mentha aquatica L. (water mint) and  Mentha spicata L. (spearmint).
1: Although a native genus of the Mediterranean region, it is cultivated all over the world for its use in flavor, fragrance, medicinal, and pharmaceutical applications.
2: Peppermint oil is one of the most widely produced and consumed essential oils [ 11,  12].
3: Besides its uses in food, herbal tea preparations, and confectioneries, the medicinal uses of mint, which date back to ancient times, include carminative, anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, antiemetic, diaphoretic, analgesic, stimulant, emmenagogue, and anticatharrhal application.
4: It is also used against nausea, bronchitis, flatulence, anorexia, ulcerative colitis, and liver complaints.
5: Mint essential oils are generally used externally for antipruritic, astringent, rubefacient, antiseptic, and antimicrobial purposes, and for treating neuralgia, myalgia, headaches, and migraines [ 13,  14].
0: From the experimental and clinical studies performed on  Mentha piperita leaf essential oil (MpEO), it seems that most of its pharmacological actions are due to its antioxidant activity which is mainly due to its ability to scavenge free radicals and/or inhibit lipid peroxidation [ 15,  16].
1: Antioxidants are substances that delay or prevent the oxidation of inter- or intra-cellular oxidizable substrates from oxidative stress.
2: In this study, we report the chemical composition and antioxidant effects of MpEO in several in vitro systems (DPPH and superoxide scavenging activities).
3: Besides, we are interested in determining the possible protective effects of MpEO against oxidative damage of the liver and kidney following an intraperitoneal administration of CCl 4, by assessing the oxidative stress profile and some serum biochemical parameters.
0: Introduction
0: Currently, it can be observed that global sustainability challenges are all closely interconnected, such as pollution, climate change, biodiversity loss, poverty, energy, and food security.
1: As stated by Liu et al.
2: [ 1], only holistic and disruptive approaches integrating various components of human and natural systems are effective in identifying and proposing suitable solutions for these challenges, especially those related to research, development, and innovation (RD&I) in interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary studies.
3: To exemplify this systemic view, Fig.
4: 1 illustrates the Earth surface that, based on the Dymaxion map (the Fuller Projection Map), shows the planet as a continuum without splitting any continents, seas, and oceans, where cycles are integrated through flows of matter, energy, and information [ 1,  2].
5: Here, Brazil, China, the Caribbean, and Africa interact across space, time, and organizational levels in many ways.
6: For instance, the expansion of soybean production aggravates deforestation in Brazil, but also provides food and feedstock to China.
7: The food trade between both countries also affects other areas, including the Caribbean and Africa.
8: Dust particles from the Sahara Desert, also increased due to unbalanced agricultural practices, can reach the Caribbean and have an impact on coral reefs and soil fertility, diminishing tourism in this region.
9: In addition, nutrient-rich particles from Africa can reach Brazil, improving its forest productivity.
0: According to the Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations [ 3], after years of progress, world hunger has increased since 2015.
1: Around 60% of the worlds starving people are from countries affected by conflict and climate change, including northeast Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, and Yemen with 20 million people, often suffering extreme climatic events such as droughts and floods.
2: Not surprisingly, some of the FAOs top priorities for the next 2 years include topics such as sustainable agriculture, climate change mitigation and adaptation, water scarcity and support of subsistence rural practices, and fisheries and forestry [ 3,  4].
3: The challenges related to this demanding context can be intensified and better understood when taking into account that the world population is expected to increase by about 30% over the next 35 years, reaching more than 9.5 billion people in 2050 and 11.2 billion in 2100 [ 5].
0: As pointed out by Xia et al.
1: [ 6], the global food waste of approximately 1.3 billion tons per year is shocking in this context and, although it should be avoided or minimized, it cannot be completely prevented nowadays.
2: Primary and secondary processing generates unpreventable food supply chain waste.
3: This can be due to a number of factors along the supply chain, differing by the commodity and country in question.
4: In general terms, developing countries such as some African countries suffer the greatest loss during the early, upstream part of the primary processing, corresponding to 75% of food losses during production and postharvest.
5: Various initiatives, e.g., building better infrastructure through knowledge transfer (more efficient storage and transport technologies) and improving collaboration and market opportunities in the food supply chain could have a positive role.
6: In industrialized countries, waste occurs especially in the consumption stage, accounting for 50% of overall loss of crops in some countries of North America, Europe, and Oceania.
7: In this case, together with educational and cultural actions, other aspects such as developing legislation to make date labels more user-friendly for consumers (sell-by, best-before, and consume-by), redesigning packaging characteristics (avoiding the buy 1 get 2 offers) and retailer marketing strategies should be considered [ 7].
0: It is estimated that around 140 billion tons of biomass from the agricultural sector are generated every year in the world [ 8,  9], and a considerable part is recognized as waste and not conflicting with food availability, e.g., leaves, roots, stalks, bark, bagasse, straw residues, seeds, wood and animal residues.
1: Using alternative strategies to avoid additional losses and produce several high value-added chemicals could minimize the volume of non-renewable materials used today (i.e., roughly 50 billion tons of fossil fuels), enough to greatly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on non-sustainable resources.
2: Therefore, considering their available volume and practically low costs locally and globally, associated to rich function, structure and chemical heterogeneity, all agro-industrial waste should also be considered for their chemical and material potential, as well as a source of energy [ 10 13].
0: An important proposal related to waste hierarchy as a framework for residue management can be seen in Fig.
1: 2 [ 14,  15], which was reformulated to include agro-industrial waste.
2: In this case, the agro-industrial waste hierarchy has a different meaning from top to bottom, since all biomass is valued as raw material.
3: Prevention is an intrinsic part of optimized processes, avoiding overproduction.
4: Therefore, the least probable option is disposal as the supply chain is designed to attend sustainable consumption, using all bio-based material generated.
5: Here, sustainable production also includes eco-efficiency, cleaner and green productivity, whereas sustainable consumption allows greener choices to be made by individuals based on eco-procurement, supply chain management, waste minimization, recycling, and resource efficiency measures.
6: Both sustainable production and consumption comprises life-cycle thinking, aiming at preventing problems shifting from one life-cycle stage to another, one geographical area or environmental compartment to another.
0: One of the most important and cited references highlighting the advances in genetics, biotechnology, process chemistry, and engineering that has helped establish a new manufacturing concept to convert renewable biomass into valuable fuels and products, known as biorefinery, was published by Ragauskas and collaborators in the mid-2000s [ 16].
1: According to these authors and other researchers [ 16,  17], integrating biomass and biorefinery technologies has the potential to develop sustainable bio-based energy and materials leading to a new manufacturing paradigm (Fig.
2: 3).
0: In fact, this paradigm is currently connected to other strong concepts, i.e., bioeconomy and circular economy; the latter is described as an industrial system that is restorative by intention and design.
1: This idea replaces the end-of-life notion with regeneration, focusing on the use of renewable energy, elimination of toxic chemicals, reutilization, return and eradication of waste through the superior design of materials, products, systems, and business models [ 18,  19].
0: As can be noted, new generations of biorefinery combine innovative biomass resources from different origins, chemical extraction and purification and/or synthesis of biomaterials, biofuels and bioenergy via benign processes.
1: From the very beginning, the identification and quantification of all potentially high value-added compounds that could be removed from the available renewable feedstocks requires another analytical approach, also connected to green chemistry [ 20,  21].

0: INTRODUCTION
0: Oils and fats are important nutrients in the case of health and also in business.
1: Due to these reasons, much research and investment are allocated to study them.
2: Oils and fats are responsible to supply a significant part of required energy for body, necessary fatty acids, and fatsoluble vitamins (Kebriti, HoseiniMazhari, Gerami, Ghiassi, & Esfandyari,  2011).
3: Recently, with the growth and increase in general knowledge, the demand for healthpromoting oils in addition to energy supply increased.
4: On the other hand, utilization of available sources and cultivation of underexplored oilseeds is a step toward providing more functional oils in the food industry.
5: Oils and fats are prepared from various plant and animal sources of which have different metabolic, physical and chemical properties (Zomorrodi, Shokrani, Shahedi, & Dokhani,  2003).
6: Black cumin ( Nigella sativa L.) variety is an annual herbaceous with a shortlife term, that is, particular to the semiarid areas.
7: Thymoquinone is detected as one of the main phenolic components of black cumin with antioxidant properties (AlOthman, Ahmad, AlOrf, AlMurshed, & Arif,  2006; Yar, ElHariri, ElBahai, & Bamosa,  2008).
8: The antioxidant compounds have shown their activities via different mechanisms (Farzaneh & Carvalho,  2015).
0: There are various conventional methods to extract oil from oilseeds such as extraction with solvents through various extractors or extraction by mechanical approach such as pressing.
1: Generally, oil extraction with pressing is a simple, safe and economical technology; therefore the advantages of this method makes it more efficient compared to solvent application approach.
2: The mechanical method is used for oilseeds with high oil content.
3: Applying this method solely is not sufficient and high amounts of oil remain in the meal which should be extracted by solvents.
4: Oil extraction by pressing is done in hot or cold conditions.
5: The yield of oil extracted in hot pressing is higher than cold pressing but because of elevated temperatures during hot pressing, the quality of the obtained oil is low while the oil obtained through cold pressing maintains its natural properties with limited chemical reactions.
6: For this reason, the demand for oils obtained from cold pressing increased (Singer, NogalaKalucka, & LampartSzczap,  2008).
7: In oil extraction with cold pressing, several factors such as pressing pressure, seed moisture and process temperature, should be considered in the efficiency of extracted oil.
0: In modern technologies, it is tried to perform the extraction process more easily and effectively in such a manner of solvent usage, extraction time and temperature could be reduced while the extraction efficiency can be improved economically (Li, Pordesimo, & Weiss,  2004).
1: In the oil extraction process, appropriate pretreatments of seeds before oil extraction is one of the most important and necessary steps to produce a high quality oil with a high efficiency (AzadmardDamirchi, Habibi, Hesari, Nemati, & Fathi,  2010).
2: Therefore, recently some techniques such as extraction with supercritical solvents (Meireles & Angela,  2003), ultrasound (Dolatabadi et al.,  2016; Jalili, Jafari, EmamDjomeh, Malekjani, & Farzaneh,  2017; Lou, Wang, Zhang, & Wang,  2010), microwave pretreatments (Bakhshabadi et al.,  2017), and pulsed electric fields (Zeng, Han, & Zi,  2010) have been investigated.
0: The microwave, nonionized electromagnetic waves with 300 MHz to 300 GHz frequency are placed between radio and infrared waves in the electromagnetic spectrum.
1: These waves are made of two oscillating vertical fields, which are electrical and magnetic fields.
2: In this procedure, heating is occurred in a determined and chosen procedure without temperature waste and dissipation in the environment, it means that it is similar to heating in a closed system.
3: This heating mechanism leads to a lower extraction time in comparison with common and usual oil extraction methods.
4: The influence of this procedure is through two phenomena of ionic transfer and dipolar rotation and mostly, both of them are occurred simultaneously (Mandal, Mohan, & Hemalatha,  2007).
5: The energy of microwave penetrates into the food and generates internal temperatures, leading to a more heating rate and shorter procedure time.
6: The oilseeds have high moisture content as a dipolar material, although in this case some other materials, including salts and proteins can also act as the dielectric components (Sultana, Anwar, & Przybylski,  2007).
7: The procedure of pulsed electric fields (PEF) has more advantages toward, using the common heating procedures for foods, because its application leads to maintain the original color, aroma and taste, texture and nutritional value of foods.
8: Furthermore, PEF might increase the speed and efficiency of the extraction.
9: PEF has been used in deactivation of microorganisms in milk, dairy products, egg, water, and other food materials (Qin, Chang, BarbosaCfinovas, & Swanson,  1995).
10: Sarkis et al.
11: ( 2015) used the PEF and high voltage electrical discharge as the pretreatment in oil extraction from sesame seeds with the purpose of destructing the cell wall and increasing the oil extraction efficiency.
12: Their results indicated that when the output energy of high voltage process increases, the destruction index might increase and also these two procedures lead to an increase in oil extraction efficiency.
13: Tale Masouleh, Asadollahi, and Eshaghi ( 2015) used the PEF as the pretreatment for oil extraction from sesame seeds.
14: Their findings revealed that PEF assists the procedure of oil extraction from sesame seeds with the use of cold pressing and an electric field with intensity of 1 kV/cm and pulse power equals to 50 might led to the maximum efficiency.
15: La et al.
16: ( 2016) used the PEF to produce fat from microalgae.
17: They used the PEF with a low energy in their research and expressed that this procedure can be an appropriate replacement for common and usual methods of fat extraction.
0: To the best of the authors knowledge, there are no studies on the application of PEF and microwave as pretreatments in oil extraction from black cumin seeds.
1: Therefore, the objective of the current research was to study the influence of applying novel technologies as the pretreatments in the oil extraction of black cumin seeds and their influence on the physicochemical properties and chemical composition of the final extracted oil.
0: Black cumin seeds were provided from a local market in GonbadeKavoos (Golestan, Iran).
1: Chemicals including ethanol, acetonitrile, phenolphthalein, sodium thiosulfate, chloroform, and hexane were purchased from Merck company (Germany).
2: The equipments applied in the present research are as the following: laboratory sieve, laboratory oven (Memmert, Buchenbach, Germany), digital scale (Gec Avery, Smethwick, UK), microwave (LG, Seoul, South Korea), PEF device (made by Research Institute of Food Science and Technology, Mashhad, Iran), spectrophotometer (Biochrom, Cambridge, UK), kjeldahl (Auto Analyser 130 Tecator CO, Warrington, UK), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) (S360, Oxford., England), refractometer (Abbe, Kobe, Jepan), Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (Agilent, San Francisco, USA), Rancimat (Metrohm, Herisau, Swiss) and laboratory screw press (Kern Kraft, Karlsruhe, Germany).

4: For example, extracts of dried leaves resulted by hot water are traditionally used for many purposes like antipyretic remedies, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic as well as for the symptoms of respiratory infections, such as cold, and flu [ 20,  21].
0: The EOs of  C. citriodora can be used as an antibacterial, antifungal, anticandidal, antioxidant, and antitrypanosomal, and also have insecticidal, acaricidal, herbicidal, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory activities [ 21 26].
1: Citronellal,  -citronellol, and isopulegol are monoterpenoids reported as major components in the leaf EO of  C. citriodora growing in Chandigarh, India [ 26,  27].
2: However, 6-octenal was reported as the major constituent in the leaf oil of  C. citriodora from Nigeria [ 25];  -pinene,  -pinene, sabinene, and  -thujene were reported to be minor constituents [ 28].
3: 3-Hexen-1-ol,  cis-geraniol, citronellol acetate, 5-hepten-1-ol, 2,6-dimethyl, and citronellal were the major components in the leaf EO of  C. citriodora grown in Zoological Garden in Giza-Egypt [ 29].
4: The EO of  C. citriodora (lemon-scented eucalyptus) showed a wide spectrum of antifungal activity as well as activity against various pathogenic bacteria and yeasts [ 22,  30 39] resulting in that the EOs of some plants, including  C. citriodora, have significant insecticidal activity against  Sitophilus zeamais, however, 50% of the efficacy was lost 8 days after treatment.
0: In the framework of our continuing research on the EO composition and biological activities of Egyptian medicinal plants, we aimed to evaluate the biological activity of the EOs of  Corymbia citriodora leaves and  Cupressus macrocarpa Citriodora branchlets.

1: Introduction
0: Peaches and nectarines ( Prunus persica (L.) Batsch) are fruit rich in vitamins, fibers and other phytochemical compounds, such as carotenes and polyphenols, which are important for a healthy diet [ 1, 2].
1: Stone fruit are consumed worldwide and represent one of the most important fruit.
2: In recent years, peach and nectarine production increased progressively [ 3] and the main global producer is China with over 12 million tons, followed by Spain and Italy, which produce 3 million tons annually [ 4].
3: Peaches and nectarines are the 3rd most important fruit crop in the European Union after apples and pears [ 5].
4: During storage, the quality characteristics and some commercial parameters of these fruit can decrease, at a rate depending on the storage conditions, due to postharvest diseases and senescence processes [ 6].
0: The most common postharvest pathogens on stone fruit are  Monilinia spp.
1: ( M. fructigena Honey,  M. fructicola (G. Winter) Honey, and  M. laxa (Aderh.
2: and Ruhland) Honey), agents of brown rot,  Botrytis cinerea Pers.
3: agent of gray mold,  Penicillium expansum Link, agent of blue mold,  Alternaria spp., agent of black mold, and  Rhizopus stolonifer, Ehrenb., agent of Rhizopus rot [ 7, 8].
4: On peaches, postharvest losses can cause even higher damage than preharvest diseases [ 9].
5: Crop protection in Europe should be performed in the orchard because only one fungicide (fludioxonil) can be used on stone fruit after harvesting, but the supermarket chains typically request either no further postharvest treatments or a limited number of active ingredients, as residues, on the fruit.
6: The last fungicide has to be applied 1 or 2 weeks before harvesting, to guarantee a high level of fruit protection against pathogens during storage, and to remain below the maximum residue limits imposed by European legislation [ 10].
7: Moreover, consumer attention is attracted by environmentally friendly production practices, preferring foods treated with natural products instead of conventional pesticides [ 11].
8: At present,  Monilinia spp.
9: control depends on an integrated strategy based on orchard fungicide spray programs and maintenance of proper storage conditions in the packinghouse and during distribution [ 12].
0: Hence, intense research efforts focus on developing innovative, unconventional, sustainable strategies to preserve fruit quality and decrease food losses.
1: The most promising control approaches are the use of microorganisms and natural products with intrinsic antimicrobial properties [ 13, 14].
2: Essential oils (EOs) represent a powerful tool to reduce the environmental impact of fruit production [ 15].
3: The efficacy of plant EOs has been extensively evaluated in vitro [ 16], but a few studies have been performed in vivo [ 17].
4: However, these treatments may modify the organoleptic characteristics of fruit, changing taste or flavor during cold storage.
0: The antifungal activity of EOs is determined by their chemical composition.
1: In particular, aldehydes, phenols and ketones considerably inhibit pathogen growth.
2: Thymol, carvacrol and  p-anisaldehyde have a proven fungicidal activity and EOs rich in these components showed the highest inhibitory activity against many postharvest pathogens, such as  Penicillium digitatum [ 18],  Colletotrichum gloeosporioides [ 19] and  R. stolonifer [ 20].
3: EOs of thyme ( Thymus vulgaris) and savory ( Satureja montana) are mainly composed of thymol and carvacrol [ 21], which are highly effective in controlling fungal pathogens.
4: Generally, the efficacy of EOs is investigated through direct contact with fruit, by application through spraying or dipping [ 22].
5: However, these application methods can have undesired effects, including phytotoxicity and organoleptic modification of treated fruit.
6: Only a few studies have reported the efficacy of EO treatments through biofumigation, focusing on phytopathological aspects [ 23].
7: Scientific research recently started to pay particular attention to the assessment of the antifungal activity of EO vapors [ 24, 25].
8: Fumigation with thyme and savory EOs resulted in effective control of several postharvest pathogens, showing antifungal activity against  Colletotrichum [ 26],  Aspergillus,  Penicillium,  Mucor and  Trichoderma spp.
9: [ 27] The use of EOs through fumigation avoids the direct contact with the product, reducing the possibility of influencing the sensorial profile.
0: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the vapor phase of thyme and savory EOs, applied by fumigation through slow-release diffusors, on both quality parameters and postharvest diseases of peaches and nectarines, during cold storage and shelf life.
1: Savory and thyme solid diffusors were prepared at two different concentrations and they were used to treat naturally infected peaches and nectarines.
2: In order to clarify how essential oils diffuse and persist in cold rooms, the atmospheric composition of the storage cabinets was analyzed during cold storage.
3: At the same time, the antimicrobial activity of essential oil vapors was evaluated in vitro on conidial germination of  M. fructicola and  B. cinerea, two of the main postharvest pathogens of peaches and nectarines.
0: The carotenoid content was determined every 14 days, using the method reported by Talcott and Howard [ 29].

3: Absolute quantification was calculated for carvacrol and thymolusing a standard calibration curve between 1 and 50 ppm (mg/L).
4: Relative quantification was determined for the other compounds, by using standard calibration curve of thymol for thyme essential oil and standard calibration curve of carvacrol for savory essential oil.
0: Peaches (Vista Rich) and nectarines (Sweet Red) were harvested from two different orchards located in Lagnasco (Cuneo, Italy, 44373360 N, 07332124 E) at the firm-ripe stage and transported immediately to the laboratory of DISAFA, University of Torino, during the summer of 2015.
1: All fruit were sorted by size.
2: Defect-free fruit were randomly divided into five lots of 350 fruit each.
3: Each lot was treated in a different way and further divided into 5 replicates of 70 fruit.
4: Each replicate was a box kept in a container at the same temperature, but different atmosphere according to the treatment.
0: EO diffusors were made by adding EO (10%  v/ v), sterilized deionized water (88%  v/ v) and Tween 20 (2%  v/ v) (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) to agar-agar (Merck) (15 g/L).
1: Lower EO concentrations were obtained by serial dilutions.
2: 50 mL of medium were poured into Petri dishes and after agar solidification, 5 diffusors were installed in storage cabinets under the fruit boxes.

1: Introduction
0: Almond is the most important tree nut crop in terms of commercial production [ 1].
1: An adaptation to harsh climates combined with an ability to develop a deep and extensive root system has allowed almond to exploit a wide range of ecological niches.
2: Almond is well-adapted to the Mediterranean climate, characterized by mild winters and dry, hot summers.
3: This adaptation has led to early bloom and rapid early shoot growth because of the low chilling requirements of almond.
4: Almond also shows high tolerance to summer drought and heat.
5: Almond has traditionally been the earliest temperate fruit tree crop to bloom, which limited growing to areas relatively free from spring frosts before the release of late-blooming cultivars by different breeding programs, since frosts at bloom or early fruit development can reduce, and even completely nullify, the crop.
6: Since almond is naturally self-incompatible, it often requires cross-pollination, which further acts to promote genetic variability and adaptability to diverse environments [ 2].
0: The edible part of the almond nut is the kernel, considered an important food crop with a high nutritional and medicinal value.
1: The oldest and most extensive medical system that first recorded the health uses for almonds derives from ancient Greeks and then the Persians, and later in traditional Chinese medicine and Indian Ayurvedic medicine [ 3].
2: From medieval times to the 18th century, almond nuts were a source of substitute milk [ 4], and also it was used as thickener before starch was discovered [ 3].
3: Almond consumption has almost doubled in the last 20 years [ 5], a fact that highlights how this consumption has evolved from a convenient snack food and component of a high number of confectioneries, to an important food which is increasingly recognized as essential for maintaining and increasing human health.
4: Recent nutritional and medical studies have associated the regular consumption of almonds with a wide range of health benefits, including protection from cancer [ 6, 7], obesity [ 8, 9, 10], diabetes [ 11, 12], and heart diseases [ 13, 14, 15, 16, 17].
5: Almond kernels may be consumed in many different ways, blanched or unblanched, raw or combined, and/or mixed with other nuts.
6: They can also be transformed to produce marzipan, nougat, almond milk, and almond flour, incorporated in many pastries and ice creams.
7: Almonds may also be combined in other products and gastronomic specialties [ 18].
8: The high nutritive value of almond kernels is mainly due to their high lipid content.
9: This lipid fraction, even constituting an important source of calories, does not contribute to cholesterol formation because of their high level of unsaturated fatty acids, mainly mono-unsaturated fatty acids [ 19].
10: Although almond kernels are high in energy, humans compensate their effect with their high satiety value [ 20].
11: The absorption of energy from almond kernels is rather inefficient, having been suggested that their chronic consumption may raise resting energy expenditure [ 21].
12: Acute and longer-term almond ingestion may help in regulating body weight [ 17], modulating fluctuations of blood glucose [ 22], total low density/high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, and triglycerides [ 23].
0: Almond kernel quality must be high in order to fulfill not only the industry requirements, but also to be attractive for the consumers [ 24].
1: Until recently only the kernel physical traits were considered when trying to establish almond quality [ 18], but the kernel chemical composition appears to be essential when establishing the best raw material for the different industrial applications and the high diversity of almond confectioneries [ 24].
2: In view of the high lipid fraction in the almond kernel, the quality of the almond oil is considered as the most important feature in the evaluation of almond quality.
3: Different parameters related to the lipid fraction have been suggested for quality evaluation of the almond kernels, such as the amount of oil content in the kernel (fat percentage over the kernel dry weight), the percentage of oleic acid of the total fatty acids, the ratio of the percentages of oleic/linoleic acids (O/L), and, especially, the tocopherol concentration in the almond oil [ 24, 25].
0: Early reviews on the composition of the almond nuts [ 18, 26] did not include tocopherols as an important component of almond kernels.
1: More recently tocopherols were already included in several reviews [ 27, 28], but most of them were primarily descriptive without attempts to assess quality, particularly as it relates not only to industrial requirements, but also to breeding goals and approaches.
2: Extensive variability in the chemical composition has been demonstrated among cultivars; additionally the importance of differences in geographical origins, as well as climatic and growing conditions have also been demonstrated.
3: Despite this extensive information, little is known concerning the genetic control and inheritance of biochemical components of almond quality.
4: For all these reasons, this review summarizes the current knowledge of the almond kernel tocopherol composition and factors affecting its variability.
0: Introduction
0: Currently, the Brazilian propolis is classified in 13 different types, according to its physical-chemical properties, botanical origin and geographic area where propolis can be collected.
1: Initially, Park et al.
2: [ 1] classified propolis samples from different Brazilian regions in 12 groups.
3: Afterwards, a 13 th type of propolis with peculiar chemical composition was found in hives located alongside the coast and mangroves in the Brazilian northeast and was called Brazilian red propolis (BRP) [ 2].
4: In the last decade, the chemical composition of BRP has been revealed and related to its bioactivities.
5: The main chemical components found in BRP are classified as isoflavones, flavones, flavonols, aurones, chalcones, pterocarpans and xanthones groups [ 3 6].
6: The botanical origin of BRP was identified as resinous exudates of  Dalbergia ecastophyllum [ 7], however, likely a second plant species participates as one of the main sources of resins for BRP [ 5].
0: Due to the variety of chemical compounds of BRP incorporated within the resin mixture, especially phenolic compounds, many biological activities have been reported like antioxidant [ 2, 8], antibacterial [ 9, 10], fungicide [ 11], antiparasitic [ 10, 12], antineoplasic [ 13, 14], anti-caries [ 15], cytotoxic [ 2, 10], anti-inflamatory [ 16, 17], antinociceptive [ 18] and was also beneficial to the wound healing process [ 19].
0: Several experiments and clinical investigations have shown the antiparasitic and adjuvant properties of the hydroalcoholic extract of propolis (HEP).
1: HEP of different types of propolis showed antiparasitary efficacy against  Giardia lamblia [ 20, 21],  Toxoplasma gondii and  Trichomonas vaginalis [ 22].
2: It is important to highlight that  T.  vaginalis is the etiological agent of trichomoniasis, the most common non-viral, sexually transmitted disease (STD) in the world [ 23].
3: In addition, metronidazole-resistant T. vaginalis has been implicated in an increasing number of refractory cases, which are usually treated with increased doses of the drug, leading to an increase in the occurrence of side effects [ 24].
4: Clearly, alternative curative therapies are needed, and propolis emerges as a natural product for alternative drugs.
0: Moreover, HEP has been used to formulate veterinary vaccines against bacterial or viral diseases, once some phenolic compounds has presented immunomodulatory activity [ 25 27].
1: As adjuvant, propolis confers to the vaccinal formulation desirable properties, such as reduced viscosity, good stability, low reactogenicity, low toxicity, and is able to induce a robust humoral and cellular response [ 26].
0: As aforementioned, most of the previous studies describing the biological activities of BRP uses ethanol as the extraction solvent, and the extraction method influences directly the yield and selectivity for some compounds [ 10, 28].
1: Volatile compounds like those found in essential oils are in low concentrations in propolis, but play an important role by contributing to propolis pleasant aroma and its biological activities.
2: Researchers have applied various methods to obtain propolis volatiles such as distilllation-extraction or hydrodistillation [ 29].
0: On the other hand, studies focusing on essential oils of propolis volatiles are relatively scarce, most of them dealing with antimicrobial properties against fungus, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [ 29].
1: Volatiles of propolis from stingless bees were able to stimulate the immune system of elderly patients by increasing their natural killer cell activity [ 30].
2: Essential oils of Chinese propolis inhibited the proliferation of human colorectal cancer cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [ 31].
3: However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies describing the chemical composition or the biological activities of the essential oil derived from the Brazilian red propolis (EOP).
4: Herein, the chemical composition of the EOP is showed.
5: Still, in vitro trichomonacidal and cytotoxic activities, and the adjuvant action of EOP in a recombinant vaccine are assessed.

1: Introduction
0: Blepharocalix salicifolius (Kunth) O. Berg is an aromatic species that belongs to the Myrtaceae family, widely distributed in South America.
1: It was reported in Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador and Brazil [ 1, 2].
2: In Brazil, it is extensively distributed, being found in the North, Southeast and South regions associated with several climatic conditions (humidity and temperature) [ 1].
3: B. salicifolius is a tree 1020 m high and 2040 cm in diameter.
4: It grows in a straight and cylindrical way, barely tortuous, and with a dark brown bark [ 3].
5: Several synonyms are attributed to this species, among them  B. tweediei and  B. giganteus [ 4].
0: In Brazil, it is known with the name of Murta, and is popularly used to treat respiratory diseases, coughs, colds, hypotension, rheumatism, hypoglycemia, diarrhea, leukorrhea, urethritis and bladder diseases [ 5, 6, 7, 8].
1: Extracts of this species showed antiparasitic, antifungal, antibacterial, allelopathic, cytotoxic and insecticide effects [ 2, 3, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15].
0: The chemical composition of the essential oil in leaves extracted from this species has been reported and mainly includes 1,8-cineol, -pinene, limonene, -pinene, -terpineol, ( E)-caryophyllene and linalool [ 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27].
1: However, few studies relating to the biological activities of the essential oil from this plant are available.
2: Until now, only fungistatic activity against  Phyllosticta citricarpa and antitussive, antispasmodic, bronchodilating and cardiac inotropic effects have been described for the essential oil from leaves of this plant [ 27, 28].
0: Breast cancer has become a great concern, as it is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths for women worldwide [ 29].
1: According to the World Health Organization, more than one million cases of breast cancer are reported worldwide annually [ 30].
2: High cost, increasing drug resistance, and side effects of current therapeutic approaches are forcing researchers to explore alternative procedures as options to find new chemical entities for cancer treatments [ 31].
3: Likewise, microbial pathogens, such as bacteria and fungi, are a major cause of human disease and are among the most concerning threats to public health due to drug-resistant strains [ 32, 33].
4: A review estimated that continued rise in microbial resistance could lead to 10 million deaths every year by 2050 [ 34].
5: Thus, there is a need for the development of new drugs and, due to broad biological action, essential oils or their isolated compounds can inspire novel discoveries.
6: Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro cytotoxic, antifungal and antibacterial activities of essential oils from the leaves of  B. salicifolius, and to identify their main chemical constituents.
0: Introduction
0: Malaria is a leading cause of human mortality.
1: In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) 1 estimated that 212 million cases of malaria occurred, leading to 419 000 deaths  82% of casualties are in sub-Saharan Africa.
2: Children under the age of 5 account for 64% of victims.
3: Malarias mortality rate dropped by 31% between 2010 and 2015 in Africa and the life expectancy of children under 5 increased by 1.2 years.
4: However, in 80% of malaria endemic countries, mosquitos developed resistance to at least one insecticide.
5: Furthermore, in Burundi, deaths have increased by 13% in the last year 2, stunting economic growth 3 where the annual per capita income is lower than 400 USD 4 and farmers hire labour at 1 USD a day.
6: As with the mass drug administration of chloroquine, which contributed to the resurgence of malaria in Peru after 30 years of low incidence 5,  Plasmodium falciparum protozoa may develop resistance to artemisinin monotherapy 6.
7: Mutations of the K13 gene are markers of artemisinin resistance but tetraoxane-based compounds have inhibitory characteristics against various strains of the protozoa 7.
8: Artesunate is more effective than quinine with fewer side effects but a child administered a high dose rectally died due to its toxicity 8.
9: Moreover, Burke  et al.
10: 9 reported that  Anopheles vaneedeni became a new malaria vector complicating the fight against the disease.
0: Preventing rather than treating the disease is a better approach; sleeping under nets impregnated with insecticides has reduced the world mortality rate from 2 million a year; they save 5.5 per 1000 children yearly 10.
1: Insecticides are losing their efficacy due to increasing mosquito resistance 11.
2: Furthermore, weather patterns like La Nina can cause unexpected peaks in mosquito populations 12.
3: Graves and Gelband 13 tested SPf66, CS-NANP, RTS,S, MSP/RESA vaccines and their ability to prevent different stages of malaria.
4: Theoretically, SPf66 and MSP/RESA protect against the asexual stages of plasmodium parasites whereas the other two target the sporozoite stages.
5: CS-NANP and MSP/RESA offered no protection against malaria, SPf66 was ineffective and RTS,S reduced malaria episodes by 58%.
6: Unfortunately, vaccines mass production and distribution is too expensive for sub-Saharan Africa 14.
7: Furthermore, the mosquitos are changing their feeding patterns to adapt to the mosquito nets.
8: Moiroux  et al.
9: 15 demonstrated that mosquitos have adapted to insecticide treated nets by changing their biting habits.
10: Proportion of outdoor biting increased from 45% to 68% 16.
11: Thus, nets will be less effective for young children and pregnant women, who are the most vulnerable to the disease.
0: Cutaneous mosquito repellents (MR) are one means to reduce the frequency of mosquito bites.
1: N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) is an effective mosquito repellant 17  20 but is cost prohibitive for rural sub-Saharan populations.
2: Targeting indigenous plants as a source of mosquito repellents will stimulate local economies and at the same time protect the population.
3: Odalo  et al.
4: 21 extracted and tested the topical repellency of essential oils indigenous to Kenya from  Conyza newii (Compositae),  Plectranthus marrubioides (Lamiaceae),  Lippia javanica (Verbenaceae),  Tetradenia riparia (Lamiaceae), as well as  Tarchonanthus camphoratus (Asteraceae).
5: The oils, under their experimental conditions (3 min, forearm exposure), repelled mosquitoes better than DEET.
6: N. cataria, commonly known as catnip or catmint, is a species of the Lamiaceae family.
7: It is native to temperate and tropical zones in Asia and in Europe and is widely cultivated 22.
8: Nepeta cataria ( N. cataria) has many uses in traditional medicine including treatment of chills, colds, constipation, headaches, infections, inflammations, rheumatism, sore throats, spasms, and stomach aches 23.
9: N. catarias essential oil possesses antibacterial and antimicrobial properties 24,  25.
10: Nepetalactone (NPL) is the major constituent of this oil 26  29.
11: DEET, applied to the forearm, repelled  Aedes aegypti,  Anopheles quadrimaculatus, and  Anopheles albimanus for 426 min, 96 min, and 87 min, respectively 29.
12: A 25% volume fraction of DEET in ethanol repelled  Aedes aegypti for 8 h 30.
13: Whereas, Bernier found that a dose of 0.5 mg cm 2 of DEET applied to a muslin cloth patch was active for 24 h. Catnips oil is a better spatial repellent than DEET and demonstrated effective topical repellency properties 31.
0: NPL is as active as DEET and its hydrogenated form  dihydronepetalactone  is two times more active than DEET when formulated with isopropyl alcohol (1% w/v) 32.
1: Among 41 different essential oils applied to skin, Catnips offered protection for 480 min 33.
2: Moreover,  N. cataria exhibits a more favorable safety profile than DEET 34.
3: Local communities widely accept essential oil based MR.
4: In Ghana, 97% of the studied population desired to continue applying the MR after the 3-month trial 35.
5: Mngongo  et al.
6: 36 found that six repellent plants essential oil were widely accepted by the population studied due to their efficacy.
0: Introducing plant based mosquito repellents to vulnerable populations faces economic challenges but also societal and governmental hurdles.
1: Furthermore, they must be nontoxic with respect to dermal and eye contact, ingestion, and inhalation.
2: Unlike synthetic repellents, the chemical composition of essential oils, like  N. cataria, contain dozens of compounds (Supplemental information S1).
3: The active ingredient must demonstrate its efficacy versus alternatives but they must also be stable with respect to UV exposure, oxidation and high temperature (>40 C).
4: Moreover, to achieve the largest possible distribution at the lowest cost, local populations must grow, harvest and extract the active ingredients.
5: Birkett and Pickett discovered the efficacy of nepetolactone and nepetolactol in repelling aphids.
6: They distilled the catnip with steam and cyclohexane vapors then reduced the oil with NaBH 4.
7: In their concluding remarks, they emphasize the potential of plants as source of commercialy vailable products 37.
8: Here we address the challenges of cultivating  N. cataria in Burundi and developing a topical mosquito repellent.
9: We compare the composition of the essential oil versus those cultivated throughout the world and measure the thermal stability and its stability versus UV.
10: Finally, we demonstrate that the population is ready to test the mosquito repellents formulated with vegetable oil or as Pickering emulsions based on an acceptability study we conducted in a rural and urban region of the country.
0: Background
0: In Mexico, diverse plants have been utilized in traditional medicine in the treatment of several diseases, as well as in the treatment of cuts, cutaneous infections, wounds and burns [ 1,  2].
1: These presumptive curative properties may be attributable to secondary metabolites that the plants possess which are distributed in leaves, flowers, stems, seeds or roots [ 2].
2: Among the plants that have been reported to exert these biological activities are those that belong to the family  Lamiaceae such as  Ocimum micranthum Willd [ 3].
3: For other species of the genus  Ocimum such as  sanctum linn,  gratissimum linn,  kilimandscharicum wound healing properties of its crude extracts, and essential oil have been reported [ 4 6]; in the case of the crude extracts of the species  micranthum, in vitro tests on healthy cell lines that support the therapeutic benefits of these extracts on wound healing and cutaneous infections have yet to be reported.
4: Moreover, studies have not addressed the potential antimicrobial activity of these extracts against pathological microorganisms.
0: Ocimum micranthum Willd is an herbaceous native plant belonging to tropical and subtropical regions of America and the West Indies [ 7].
1: In Mexico, this plant is distributed in the states of Campeche, Chiapas, Colima, Jalisco, Oaxaca, Puebla, Queretaro, Quintana Roo, Sinaloa, Tabasco, Tamaulipas, Veracruz and Yucatan [ 8].
2: Previous studies have indicated that the essential oil of this species has activity against human pathogens, fungi, insects, and larvae in addition to its antioxidant, antiprotozoal, anti-inflammatory and contraceptive properties.
3: It is believed that these properties may be related to the presence of diverse chemical compounds in the leaves of this plant [ 7,  9].
0: The chemical composition of the leaf oil of  Ocimum micranthum Willd has been previously reported to comprise volatile compounds such as eugenol, -elemene, -elemene -caryophyllene, isoeugenol and methyl eugenol [ 10,  11].
1: The compounds eugenol and methyl eugenol have also been identified in aqueous and ethanolic extracts of this plant [ 11] and are phenolic derivatives commonly known for their use in cosmetic products (fragrances) and as flavoring agents in food products; both compounds have shown antiseptic, antibacterial and analgesic properties [ 12].
2: The effects of eugenol on mast cells and melanoma cells have been reported [ 13] and due to the broad field of application of this compound, it will be important to know its action on healthy human cells, such as skin cells (fibroblast and keratinocytes) [ 14].
0: Due to the chemical composition of the essential oil and extracts (ethanolic and aqueous) derived from the  micranthum species, its therapeutic use in traditional medicine for the treatment of cutaneous infections and wounds, and since there are no scientific reports that support these bioactivities, the aim of the present study was to assess the essential oil and crude extracts (ethanolic and aqueous) of this plant for antimicrobial activity against some pathogenic microorganisms.
1: In addition, the proliferative activity was assessed in vitro on a healthy human cell line (hFB) and the CHO-K1 cell line with the purpose of providing evidence (research-based) for its bioactivity and effects on a healthy cell line associated with the process of wound healing.
0: Background
0: Candida albicans, a commensal fungi, develops into a resilient pathogen under low host immunity such as that for immunocompromised individuals with HIV/AIDS, and patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy [ 1 3].
1: A limited number of antifungals are available for treating such infections, and the use of these antifungal classes, including azoles, echinocandins, polyenes and allylamines, can be accompanied by side effects.
2: Poor bioavailability requires higher doses, which can ultimately result in resistance and ineffectiveness [ 4].
3: The continued high morbidity following systemic fungal infection and emerging resistance to antifungal agents underscore a clear need for alternatives [ 5].
4: In this context, essential oils (EOs) are gaining popularity due to their strong antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity [ 6,  7].
5: EO combinations with other essential oils or existing antifungal agents could vastly reduce the probability of multi-drug resistance [ 6 11].
6: However, comprehensive studies are required to fully assess their independent pharmacological properties and potential side effects prior to consideration for clinical use as antifungal agents.
0: Cinnamon oil is an aromatic liquid obtained from the twigs, bark and leaves of  Cinnamomum zeylanicum [ 12].
1: Extracts of cinnamon bark (CNB) and leaves (CNL) have been used extensively as therapeutics in many cultures since antiquity.
2: The anti-candida activity of CNB oil against planktonic and biofilm culture of  C. albicans and  non- albicans spp.
3: has been documented [ 7,  13 15].
4: The main constituents of CNB oil include trans-cinnamaldehyde, and minor components such as eugenyl acetate, linalool, and benzyl benzoate, each having antifungal activity [ 16 20].
5: CNB oil has been shown to alter cell membrane permeability and fluidity, and inhibit biofilm formation [ 7,  13,  15,  21], but the mechanisms of toxicity remain unknown.
6: On the other hand, each component has been extensively studied, showing effects at various cellular sites, including the cell membrane and cytosol.
7: For example, cinnamaldehyde, the major constituent of CNB oil, targets the membrane and causes increased cell wall thickness in  C. albicans [ 16], attributed to -1-3-glucan synthase inhibition as observed in  Saccharomyces cerevisiae [ 22].
8: The increase in bud scar formation upon cinnamaldehyde exposure also suggests an impact on cell division, resulting in decreased viability [ 16,  23].
9: Benzyl benzoate and linalool affect membrane fluidity and induce cell cycle arrest at the G2-M and G1 phases, respectively [ 20] at concentrations greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) [ 7,  16,  17,  23].
10: We hypothesized that the cell wall and membrane are primary targets of CNB oil, which in turn disrupt intracellular processes vital to  Candida survival.
0: Here, we report a detailed characterization of the anticandidal effects of CNB oil using atomic force microscopy (AFM), laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) and traditional biochemical assays.
1: AFM quantitative imaging (QITM) is a powerful tool for assessing the impact of antifungals [ 24 28], nutrient stress [ 29], oxidative stress [ 30] and characterizing yeast genetic mutants [ 31], while LSCM imaging of fluorescent markers can delineate defects in intracellular processes.
2: AFM was used to quantify the morphological, ultrastructural and biophysical properties of RSY150 and a clinical isolate exposed to CNB oil.
3: The RSY150 strain of  C. albicans with RFP tagged histone protein B (Htb-RFP) and GFP tagged -tubulin (Tub2-GFP) was used to track cell cycle defects in response to CNB oil exposure.
4: Finally biochemical assays were used to verify physiological changes identified by imaging.
5: We report for the first time that CNB oil causes -tubulin depolymerisation and cell cycle arrest, which we attribute to its major constituent cinnamaldehyde.

4: Pycnocycla bashagardiana Mozaff.
5: is an endemic species found only in the south of Iran.
6: It is commonly distributed in the Jask County, Hormozgan Province ( 4).
7: Due to the widespread use of  P. bashagardiana fruits in Iranian traditional medicine for relief and treatment of pain and inflammation-based disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, we were prompted to assess the analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities of the fruits essential oil and examine the pharmacological basis for the folkloric use of it as an antinociceptive and anti-inflammation agent.
8: As the fruits of  P. bashagardiana contain a high amount of essential oils (1.6%, v/w) and possess a strong smell, we were prompted to evaluate the mentioned effects of its essential oil for the first time.
9: The  P. bashagardiana fruits essential oil (PBFEO) was also analyzed by Gas chromatography and GC-MS in order to detect the potentially responsible compounds for observed activities.
0: Background
0: Leishmaniasis are parasitic diseases.
1: More than 20  Leishmania species have about 70 natural reservoir hosts and vectors including animals, such as dogs or rodents, and human bodies, and are transmitted by more than 90 sand fly species.
2: These diseases are considered as a serious health concern which are occurring in Africa, Asia, Southern Europe and Latin America.
3: Their prevalence rate was estimated from 900 000 to 1.3 million new cases and from 20 000 to 30 000 deaths annually.
4: The parasite may survive for decades in asymptomatic infected people and can also be transmitted directly from person to person.
5: Many factors can increase leishmaniasis like malnutrition, migration, poor housing, a weak immune system, environmental and climatic changes such as deforestation and temperature variation and lack of financial resources [ 1 3].
6: In the absence of effective and sustainable vaccines, its control is still considered as a major public health problem [ 4].
7: The chemotherapy and the drugs based on pentavalent antimonials as sodium stibugluconate (Pentostam) and meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime) are the current means of treatment [ 5].
8: Therefore, the required long-term treatment, toxicity, grave side-effects, pain, cost, drug resistance associated with treatment failures point out the crucial need for new agents in the treatment of leishmaniasis [ 4,  6].
0: Natural products traditionally used in folk medicine to treat several diseases are analyzed worldwide.
1: In this regard, complex mixtures or purified compounds obtained from organic/aqueous extracts and essential oils of roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits and spices are various sources of diverse bioactive natural constituents [ 7 9].
2: The investigations showed that wild and cultivated plants exhibited various pharmacological activities such as antimicrobial, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antiparasitic including anti-leishmanial ones [ 10].
3: Moreover, some plants essential oils and their main constituents displayed anti-leishmanial activities [ 6].
0: Haplophyllum tuberculatum A. Juss is a perennial herb, belonging to the rutaceae family, native of North Africa and other areas of the Middle East.
1: The aerial part of this plant is used as laxative, to cure gastro-intestinal affections, intermittent fevers, rheumatisms [ 11], malaria, gynecological disorders and renal disorders [ 12].
2: Moreover, reviews have reported  H. tuberculatum as having nematicidal [ 13,  14], hepatoprotective [ 15], antiplasmodial [ 16,  17] and insecticidal activities [ 18].

4: Furthermore, these essential oils exhibited nematicidal [ 13], antimicrobial [ 19,  20], acetylcholinesterase inhibition and repellent activities [ 20].
0: The main aim of the present study is to analyze the volatile oils of different  H. tuberculatum parts collected during two different seasons, to evaluate their anti-leishmanial effects against  L. mexicana mexicana promastigote forms and their cytotoxic activities against CHO cells in an in vitro model.
1: In order to relate the oils bioactivities to pure components ones, a major compound, limonene, and two minor ones, octanol and linalool, were tested in vitro.
2: The other identified major compounds,  cis-p-menth-2-en-1-ol,  trans-p-menth-2-en-1-ol,  cis-piperitol are not commercially available.
0: INTRODUCTION
0: In recent years, the efficacy of herbal medicines in inflammatory and oxidant-related diseases has been reported.
1: [ 12] Oxidative stress plays a leading role in the pathogenesis of aging and degenerative diseases such as atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer.
2: [ 3] Free radicals are degraded to nonreactive forms by enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant defenses produced in the body and others supplied by the diet.
3: Among these, essential oils of plants have been studied for their potential antioxidant capacities,[ 456] which can be attributed to the presence of terpenes, besides the phenolic compounds that contribute to the free radical scavenging activity.
4: [ 7]
0: The terpenes are the main components of the essential oils from medicinal plants, mainly from the aromatic species of the Lamiaceae family; these have been considered as natural antioxidants with high potential, which could be used as additives in food supplements to prevent the oxidative stress that contributes to the appearance of degenerative diseases.
1: [ 67] This family is one of the larger families of plants with distinctive flowers, with about 236 genera and approximately 7200 species around the world.
2: [ 8]
0: The essential oil of basil, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, oregano, and thyme possesses antioxidant properties due to its major terpenes.
1: [ 9] Thymol and carvacrol are responsible for the antioxidant activity of essential oils of  Thymus spathulifolius and  Origanum vulgare ssp.
2: hirtum;[ 1011] essential oil of  Melissa officinalis (its main constituents are neral, geranial, citronellal, isomenthone, and menthone) shows free radical scavenging activity.
3: [ 12] In addition, isomenthone and menthone are also the terpenes of higher capacity antioxidant of the essential oil of  Mentha longifolia and  Mentha piperita, while in the essential oil of  Mentha aquatica, the 1,8-cineole is the responsible of this activity.
4: [ 13] Antioxidant capacity in the essential oil of  Melaleuca alternifolia is due to -terpinene, -terpinene, and -terpinolene compounds;[ 14] and the -caryophyllene in the essential oil of  Marrubium peregrinum is the one which presents the greater antioxidant activity.
5: [ 15]
0: To this family belongs the genus  Satureja L., which includes about 200 species of aromatic plants that contain >0.5% of essential oil,[ 16] its main constituents are carvacrol, thymol, phenols, and flavonoids,[ 17] responsible compounds of the  in vitro antioxidant properties of  Satureja hortensis,  Satureja spicigera,  Satureja cuneifolia, and  Satureja cilicica.

0: Introduction
0: Echinops is one of the most important and largest genera of the Compositae family comprising more than 120 species worldwide [ 1].
1: These plants are distributed from Eastern Europe to Central Asia and from the South to the tropical mountains of Africa [ 2], of which about 54 species are represented in Iran [ 3].
0: Diverse species of this genus are extensively applied in Chinese and Indian folk medicine as a stimulant for milk secretion, analgesic, antityphus, to expel miasma, calm stomach ache diuretic and reduce asthma attack [ 4, 5].
1: In recent years, various pharmacological effects of  Echinops have been investigated, such as antifungal [ 6, 7], antiprotozoal [ 8, 9], antipyretic [ 10], reproductive [ 11], hepatoprotective [ 12 14], anti-cancer [ 15 17], antioxidant [ 18 20], antifeedant [ 21], anti-inflammatory [ 22 24] and antibacterial [ 25 29].
2: According to our survey, only few reports are found about their immunomodulatory effects in the literature.
3: Tehrani  et al.
4: investigated the effect of the methanol extract of  Echinops ilicifolius on peripheral blood mononuclear cells proliferation and interleukin (IL)-4 secretions [ 30].
0: Like many other representatives of the family Compositae,  Echinops species produce essential oils and volatile components, but in spite of the large size of this genus, the composition of the volatile constituents is known only for a small number of species [ 9, 25, 31 35]; therefore, developing different techniques can be used for the extraction of volatile organic components from plants.
1: Hydrodistillation (HD) and headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) are common extraction methods.
0: Herein we wish to report the analysis of the essential oils of the flowers, leaves and roots of  Echinops ilicifolius as native plant of Yazd through HD and results have been compared with those obtained using the HS-SPME method.
0: Background
0: Essential oil is a hydrophobic liquid extracted from various parts of plants such as flowers, leaves, stems and roots [ 1].
1: Due to its aromatic characteristic, essential oil has long been used in the food and cosmetic industries as a flavoring agent [ 2].
2: Furthermore, many essential oils exhibit antioxidant properties, which can have a positive effect on biological systems [ 3,  4] as well as on food production by preventing oxidation [ 5].
0: For a long time, essential oils have been the basis of traditional medicine in many countries [ 6,  7].
1: They are used with many biological properties including bactericidal, virucidal, fungicidal, antiparasitical, insecticidal, as well as with other medicinal properties such as analgesic, sedative, antiinflammatory, spasmolytic, and locally anesthetic remedies [ 8,  9].
2: At present, promising researches have been reportedly using essential oils in medicinal products for human health [ 10].
3: These recent works have shown the importance of essential oils in treating other diseases like respiratory tract, digestive system, gynecological, andrological, endocrine, cardiovascular, nervous system, and skin infections.
4: Many of them have shown anticancer activities, too [ 11].
0: The  Rhaponticum genus which belongs to the Asteraceae family is among the aromatic plants.
1: This genus consists of about 30 species that are spread over the world [ 12].
2: As shown by the literature, several species of this genus are used in the traditional medicine.
3: Indeed, the root of  Rhaponticum uniflorum has been used for the treatment of fever and intoxication.
4: It has been found that this species possesses anti-atherosclerotic activity and inhibits the lipids peroxidation [ 13].
5: On the other hand,  Rhaponticum carthamoides has long been employed in cases of overstrain and common weakness after illness [ 14].
6: Actually, the extracts and isolated compounds from rhizomes and roots of this species are used for their adaptogenic and tonic properties in various dietary supplements or nutraceutical preparations to eliminate physical weakness, promote muscle growth, and treat impotency [ 15].
0: Rhaponticum acaule (L) DC, also known as  Leuzeaacaulis L. or  Centaurea chamaerhaponticum Ball., is one of the most remarkable aromatic plants having an earlier spring flowering, from January to March.
1: It grows wild in rosette on the slopes and in sandy pastures.
2: It is a North African endemic species, distributed in the north and central areas of Tunisia.
0: The only work published about the chemical composition of the aerial parts essential oils of  R. acaule reported its richness in oxygenated sesquiterpenes (21.3%), aromatic compounds (23.6%) and diterpenoids (23.7%) [ 16].
1: In the same work, it was also found that the essential oil exhibited an interesting antibacterial activity [ 16].
2: However, to the best of our knowledge and according to literature, there are no reports on the antioxidant activities and enzyme inhibition effects of the essential oil from  R. acaule.
0: Therefore, the goal of this study was to establish the chemical composition, the antioxidant effects of the essential oil of  R. acaule collected in a very different habitat of Tunisia and its inhibitory power against -glucosidase, xanthine oxidase and pancreatic lipase.
1: Enzyme kinetic studies using Michaelis-Menten and the derived Lineweaver-Burk (LB) plots were performed to understand the possible mechanism of inhibition exercised by the components of this essential oil.
0: INTRODUCTION
0: There are a great number of unexpected environmental, social, or pathological stimuli that happen during life and that can trigger stress.
1: Being exposed to external stressors is recognized to increase the risk of psychiatric disorders such as depression, high susceptibility to infections, cancer development, and immune dysfunctions especially due to the higher levels of glucocorticoids ( 1).
2: There is growing evidence in recent years indicating that exposure to certain psychological experiences, including stress-induced diseases, is closely connected with variations in immune parameters.
3: In some cases, it has been noticed that both depression and chronic stressors have had significant connections with reduced adaptive/acquired immunity and inflammation; however, only recent studies have pointed out that after being exposed to stress or during certain episodes of depression, an innate inflammatory/immune response is strongly activated ( 23).
4: The study by Munhoz,  et al., for instance, reveals that chronic unpredictable stress potentiated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nuclear factor kappa B (NFB) activation and mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory genes in the frontal cortex and hippocampus ( 4).
5: Among the essential signaling components of the mammalian host defense system are Toll-like receptors (TLRs) ( 5).
6: Recently, a number of research works have shown interest in TLRs and their potential roles in neuropathology ( 6).
7: The finding that neurons, astrocytes and resident microglia express TLRs, just like immune cells ( 7), has challenged the way neuroscience explains the role of the brains immune system ( 8).
8: In an experimental model of depression in rodents, the expression of mRNA levels for Tolllike receptor 4 (TLR-4) in the brain cortex overweighed those in a normal brain ( 9).
0: Currently, there is a growing interest in the use of medicinal plants as a group of natural substances that could be a good source for managing of disorders.
1: Considerable attention has been invested in the positive effects of natural medication on alleviating stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depressive disorders ( 10).
2: The Lamiaceae family is among the largest and most distinctive families of flowering plants.
3: It has about 220 genera and almost 4000 species worldwide ( 11).
4: Labiatae are best known for the essential oils of many family members.
5: Origanum vulgare L. Oregano as an aromatic plant is rich in phenolic compounds with therapeutic actions widely distributed throughout Asia, including Iran.
6: Oregano is the herb widely used in cooking and natural medicine.
7: It has applied for the treatment of respiratory and hypoglycemic diseases and microorganisms inhibition ( 1213141516).
8: Previous studies have shown that oregano oil contains thymol, -terpinene, carvacrol, cis-terpinene, p-cymene, linalool, terpinen-4-ol, and sabinene hydrate as the main components ( 1718).
9: It has been reported that thymol exhibit significant anti-anxiety activity in rat ( 19).
10: Moreover, in the plus maze test, anxiolytic effects are presented by carvacrol (5-isopropyl-2-methylphenol) ( 20), which is one of the major components of the essential oil of oregano ( 18).
0: The identification of active components such as thymol and carvacrol from oregano that have been shown to induce anti-anxiety effects and other bioactive polyphenols, prompted us to assess the antidepressant potential of oregano essential oil.
1: To the best of our knowledge, the antidepressant effects of oregano essential oil (OEO) have not been fully investigated.
2: In this present study, the chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) model was used to further elucidate the antidepressant-like effects of oregano.
3: In the (CUS) model ( 21), animals are subjected to a variety of unpredictable stressors continuously leading to neurochemical and behavioral changes that are similar to those found in people with depression.
4: Furthermore, since the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex are critical for stress ( 222324), the corresponding changes in TLR2/4 gene expression in these important brain areas were examined along with the behavioral evaluation.

1: Introduction
0: For over thousand years, herbs and plants have played a major role in traditional and herbal based medicines.
1: Herbal infusions and plants are the major source of phenolic compounds in our diet.
2: It is known that phenolic compounds have many biological activities such as antioxidant and antimicrobial [ 1].
3: Due to the increasing popularity of a whole market for herbal dietary supplements and traditional medicines, we present in this study the chemical analysis and potential bioactivities of a unique herbal tea combination named Kainari.
0: Kainari is a combination (mixture) of several spices, in powder form, which is used as herbal tea, usually with an intense red color, traditionally prepared in the Greek island of Lesvos and used in folk medicine as a warming beverage in winter.
1: Historically, it was brought to the island from Greek emigrants from Asia Minor in early 19th century.
2: In Turkey, a similar herbal tea called kaynar (means in Turkish boiled) or Lohusa Serbeti (convalescence serbet) is used traditionally in childbirth to give energy to the new mothers and to boost their lactation [ 2].
0: The tradition of making Lohusa Serbeti after a birth probably is derived from Byzantine birth tradition (custom) where what was called lochozema, a nourishing broth, was given to new mothers [ 2,  3].
1: It is mentioned in ceremonial books that after the birth of an imperial child Porphyrogenitus and in one-week-long period of celebration, the preparation of lochozema, a nutritious childbed soup like broth, was offered in Constantinople's main streets.
2: Then, as birth custom, it was given to all new mothers, to aid milk production and recovery [ 4,  5].
0: The exact history of Lohusa Serbeti is not known but the drink was certainly popular during the latter part of the Ottoman Empire (12991922), when the drink was given to new mothers, people that visited the new mother and with jugs of the drink also sent to the mother's friends, family, and cleric as a way of announcing the birth of her child.
1: After drinking Lohusa Serbeti everybody present had to say a prayer asking God to bless the new mother with a plentiful supply of breast milk [ 2].
2: A fifteenth-century Turkish poem by Suleyman Celebi describes how Amine, mother of the prophet Muhammed, is given serbet to quench her thirst during labour [ 6].
0: It is also important the red color of the drink as it is a symbol in Turkey for good luck and joy [ 2], but also has a symbolic imperial importance [ 7].
1: Moreover, red color is considered apotropaic, by which is meant that red color is thought to ward off evil so by giving a red drink to a new lactating mother, protect both the mother and her baby [ 2].
0: To prepare Lohusa Serbeti, water, cinnamon sticks and cloves, and lohusa sugar (pink-red in color, natural red color, or red food dye) are boiled together, to be served hot in winter or cold during summer [ 2,  8,  9].
0: Kainari, as already referred to, arrived to Lesvos Island after 1922 and it is used as a pleasant, aromatic, tonic, warming beverage.
1: The composition of the mixture differentiates from Lohusa Serbeti and in our days, Kainari infusion is prepared by adding hot water to half spoon of Kainari mixture, which is produced by mixing powders of several spices, while the exact composition of mixture is kept secret.
2: Some of the ingredients that are usually part of the herbal tea combination are mainly cinnamon and clove and in smaller quantities other spices such as ginger, nutmeg, galangal, and pepper.
0: The objective of this research was to study, for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, the composition of three different Kainari samples from three villages of Lesvos Island (Greece), as well as to evaluate the total phenolic content (TPC) and the potential antioxidant and antimicrobial activity.
1: Six volatile compounds and two azo food dyes have been isolated and identified.
2: The total phenolic content was estimated by Folin-Ciocalteu method and the free radical scavenging activity was determined by DPPH and ABTS assays.
3: Moreover, the antimicrobial activity of the samples was tested against six Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, two oral pathogens, and three pathogenic fungi.
0: Background
0: Food is a source of hazards which can be either biological or chemical.
1: Biological hazards are most frequent due to the regular ingestion of microorganisms and toxins, causing food intoxication in one out of three persons nowadays [ 1].
2: Food intoxications have a large social impact and have caused many diseases including typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, brucellosis, botulism, cholera [ 2].
3: To limit the incidence of these diseases, antibacterial extracts including plants have been used [ 3].
4: These substances sometimes produce harmful effects.
5: Fatty acids are natural constituents of foods with no side effect on human health.
6: They are the main constituents of edible oils and confer to their stability countless nutritional and biological properties.
7: Fish oils are good sources of polyunsaturated fatty acids [ 4].
8: The -3 and -6 fatty acids of fish oils are known for their therapeutic properties [ 5,  6].
9: Previous studies highlighted the antibacterial activity of polyunsaturated fatty acids from several fish oil species [ 5,  7].
10: They could be an alternative of dietary supplement against bacteria responsible for food poisoning diseases.
0: Cameroon is located in one of the largest river basins in the world.
1: Its aquatic fauna is abundant and diversified.
2: However, there are few data on fish oil composition [ 8] and their antimicrobial activities had almost not yet been initiated.
3: Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus and  Hepsetus odoe are widespread in the tropical regions.
4: C. nigrodigitatus belongs to Claroteidae family.
5: It is highly commercial, marketed fresh, smoked or dried, and apart from being a cheap source of highly nutritive protein, it also contains other essential nutrients required by the body [ 9].
6: H. odoe is usually found near the banks of rivers in heavy vegetation, but can also be found in swampy environments, lagoons and backwaters.
7: It bears a striking resemblance to the European pike.
8: It is however, the only member of its genus [ 10].
0: The present study was designed to promote fish oils as a complement against bacteria responsible for food poisoning diseases.

0: INTRODUCTION
0: African walnut ( Tetracarpidium conophorum) is a popular Central and Western Africa plant where it is planted mainly for its nuts, which are usually eaten as snacks when the unshelled nuts are boiled and cracked (Babalola,  2011).
1: The proximate composition of  T. conophorum revealed that it is rich in protein (29.14%), fat (54.14%), carbohydrate (4.17%), ash (3.32%), and several vitamins (Arinola & Adesina,  2014).
2: A bitter taste is usually observed upon drinking water immediately after eating the nuts, due to the presence of antinutrients.
3: The leaves, barks, and nuts of  T. conophorum have also been demonstrated as good sources of phenolic antioxidants with various biological properties.
4: Food materials are usually processed in order to improve palatability and reduce toxicity, and as a means of preservation (Kanu, Kalu, & Okorie,  2015).
5: Walnuts seeds are generally consumed after several processing techniques.
6: General method of processing of walnut prior to consumption involves prolonged cooking of the seeds by boiling and roasting with or without the shell.
7: These processing methods usually improve the organoleptic properties of the nuts, reduce their antinutrients content, and prolong their shelf life (Ayankunbi, Keshinro, & Egele,  1991).
0: Thermal or heat processing is one of the most important methods developed by humans.
1: During thermal processing, eventhough antinutritional components are reduced or eliminated; heat has a detrimental effect on the nutritional and functional properties of foods (Kanu et al.,  2015).
2: Then, the thermal treatment of walnuts can lead to chemical changes that can affect its nutritional value and the quality of its lipids.
3: During boiling and roasting of the seeds, high temperatures can facilitate lipid oxidation and nonenzymatic browning reactions, which can reduce the nutritional value of foods, causing the loss of essential fatty acids, essential aminoacids and carbohydrates.
4: The amount of vitamins can also be reduced as well as the proteins digestibility (Cuvelier & Maillard,  2012).
5: Additionally, these chemical alteration reactions may generate toxic compounds in edible seeds and the derived products, which can be harmful for the consumers (Djikeng et al.,  2017).
0: Tetracarpidium conophorum is cultivated in littoral and western Cameroon, where it is, respectively, known as  kaso or  ngak.
1: The seeds are boiled and roasted for commercialization, consumption, and biscuitlike snack food production (Babalola,  2011).
2: Many studies have reported the effect of processing temperature on the nutritional, antinutritional values, and antioxidant properties, and African walnut seeds in some countries.
3: These include: effect of boiling and traditional roasting on the nutritional, antinutritional, and antioxidant properties of African walnuts seeds (Arinola & Adesina,  2014); impact of processing on the nutrient content, vitamin, and mineral composition of African walnuts (Okonkwo & Ozoude,  2014); effect of cooking on phenolic content and antioxidant properties of African walnuts seeds Ademiluyi, Oboh, Aragbaiye, Oyeleye, and Ogunsuyi ( 2015).
4: Though considerable attention had been given to the study of African walnut seeds, there is, however, very limited reports on the effects of processing on the walnut seeds grown in Cameroon, and especially on the quality of their lipids.
5: Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of boiling and different roasting methods on lipid quality and proximate composition of walnut seeds.

0: Fungi are significant spoilage microorganism of foodstuffs during the storage, rendering them unfit for human consumption by retarding the quality of food.
1: These fungi may produce as secondary metabolites a diverse group of chemical substances known as mycotoxins.
2: Aflatoxins are the most hazardous mycotoxins that contaminate foods.
3: They are produced by fungi such as  Aspergillus flavus and  Aspergillus parasiticus ( A. flavus belonged to  Aspergillus family).
4: The favorable humidity and temperature for its activity are 8090% and 3638C, respectively (Benavides, VillalobosCarvajal, & Reyes,  2012; Kamkar, Karim, Aliabadi, & Khaksar,  2008; Nazzaro, Fratianni, De Martino, Coppola, & De Feo,  2013).
0: Wheat ( Tricitum aestivum), one of the most important staple foods used in Iran, is susceptible to fungal attack either in the field or during storage, and adversely affect quality of it that destined for human and livestock.
1: Moreover, mold growth on cheese is a common problem for the cheese manufacturer during ripening and curing as well as for the retailer and consumer during refrigerated storage (Balaguer, LopezCarballo, Catala, Gavara, & HernandezMunoz,  2013; de ElgueaCulebras et al.,  2016; Reis et al.,  2012).
0: Various chemical and physical methods have been studied for inhibiting the growth of fungi; among them, plant essential oils are known as one of the most effective and natural methods.
1: Plantderived spices have been used in foods as flavoring agents.
2: Nevertheless, there are a number of studies that demonstrated these compounds also exhibit antimicrobial activity by interfering and destabilizing the operation of the phospholipids bilayer of the cell membrane, enzyme systems, and genetic material of bacteria (Azizkhani, Misaghi, Basti, Gandomi, & Hosseini,  2013; Kim, Marshall, & Wei,  1995; Zhang & Lokeshwar,  2012).
3: Examples of these antimicrobial spices are garlic, onion, cinnamon, mustard, black pepper, oregano, rosemary, Jamaican pepper, cardamom, and clove (AguilarGonzalez, Palou, & LopezMalo,  2015; Li, Shi, Liang, Huang, & Chen,  2014; Manso, CachoNerin, Becerril, & Nerin,  2013; Ye, Dai, & Hu,  2013).
0: Thyme is a spice plant belonging to the Lamiacea family that geographically grows only in Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.

0: INTRODUCTION
0: With the increase in population and the emergence of new phenomena such as the development of cities, the establishment of factories and, consequently, the employment of family members, to provide livelihood and relative welfare, the need for readymade foods has become a necessity and expanded to some extent that these foods are an integral part of people's lives today, while chicken products are of particular importance (Luiz, Moreira, Correa Ede, & Falcao,  2004).
1: One of the products of chicken meat is frozen raw chicken burger.
2: Meat keeping is limited due to its biological composition, even in glacial conditions, and it quickly receives microbial and chemical contamination, which can, in addition to health hazards, cause undesirable changes in its qualitative characteristics such as taste and smell, color, texture and a reduction in nutritional value and, finally, a loss of shelf life (Davidson & Zivanivic,  2003).
3: Oxidative spoilage causes unpleasant smell, undesirable flavor changes, eventually a change in the nutrient structure and a decrease in the nutritional value of the product, while microbial spoilage and contamination lead to serious risks to the health of the consumer.
4: Therefore, the use of appropriate substances with antibacterial and antioxidant activity is useful and necessary to improve the quality and increase the shelflife of the meat while preventing economic losses.
5: Antioxidants have been used for many years as additives in food.
6: In fact, antioxidants, by reducing the rate of fat oxidation, increase the shelflife of foodstuffs and improve the stability of lipids and lipid foods, thereby preventing the loss of sensory characteristics and their nutritional value (Burt,  2004).
7: Today, the use of natural antioxidants, such as spices and plants, as an alternative to synthetic antioxidants, is highly recommended for food preservation (Sakanaka, Tachibana, & Okada,  2005).
0: The  Pimpinella anisum L is from the Umbelliferae family, a herbaceous annual plant, the most part of which is its green, pearshaped and small fruits that are found in Turkey, Iran, India, Egypt and many other tropical regions.
1: This plant is used as a flavoring in the food and pharmaceutical industries (AlBayati,  2008; Gulcin et al.,  2003).
2: Based on the research, anise essential oil contains anothole, eugenol, methylchavicol, anisaldehyde and estragole and anothole has been identified as an effective ingredient in anise essential oil (AbdelReheem & Oraby,  2015).
0: According to what stated, the use of natural ingredients in food sources can be a good alternative to artificial preservatives, but restricts the cost of using and other problems, such as odor intensity, potential toxicity, and uncontrolled release of these substances into food products and also inactivation of food.
1: One strategy to reduce the dose of essential oil while maintaining their effectiveness can be adding these natural compounds to edible coatings and films (SanchezGonzalez, Vargas, GonzalezMartinez, Chiralt, & Chafer,  2011).
2: Chitosan is a biopolymer that has many uses in the food industry and is the second most natural polymer in nature after cellulose.
3: The polysaccharide has functional properties such as microbial, fungicidal and antioxidant properties, and also has properties such as compatibility with environment, biodegradation, nontoxicity and various physical and chemical properties.
4: Other functional properties of chitosan are the ability to form film, adhesion properties, adsorption, refinement and as a dietary fiber used in food, medicine, pharmacy, dyeing, textiles, cosmetics, and so on.
5: A wide range of microorganisms including grampositive bacteria, gramnegative bacteria and molds are sensitive to chitosan (Vasconez, Flores, Campos, Alvarado, & Gerschenson,  2009).
0: According to the stated contents, the study aimed to investigate the effect of edible Chitosan film containing anise essential oil (AEO) on microbial and chemical properties of chicken burger kept at refrigerated (4  1C) temperature.

0: Introduction
0: Cocoa is the mature fruit of the cocoa tree ( Theobroma cacao L.), growing in tropical regions of Africa and South America  [1].
1: Raw cacao beans are one of the most nutritious foods in the world and has been demonstrated to protect the body from the impact of free radicals, reduces stress and depression, protect against heart diseases and many types of cancer  [2].
2: This health promoting effect of cocoa beans is generally attributed to the presence of polyphenols.
3: The polyphenols in cocoa beans contribute to about 1218% of the dry weight of the whole bean.
4: Main classes of polyphenolic compounds found in cocoa beans are simple phenols, benzoquinones, phenolic acids, flavonoids etc.
5: [3].
6: In addition, cocoa beans are a good source of nutrients (lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, minerals and vitamins)  [4].
0: Cocoa beans are mostly consumed after several processing techniques.
1: The cocoa pre-processing steps (harvest, breaking, fermentation and drying) are mandatory to ensure good quality of beans, but cocoa flavors develop during fermentation and roasting.
2: The most commercial products of cocoa are made with roasted beans [ 5,  6].
3: The main goal of technological treatment is to improve the organoleptic properties of cocoa beans and eliminate its antinutrients (Hydrocyanate, Oxalate and Theobromine).
0: During roasting, flavor precursors that are developed during fermentation interact to produce the desired chocolate flavor, which are formed between amino acids and sugars through Maillard reaction [ 5,  6].
1: Cocoa beans that are not roasted have bitter, acidic, astringent and nutty flavor.
2: By roasting the cocoa beans, acidity is decreased by reducing the concentration of volatile acids  [7].
3: However, processing may also cause chemical changes that may decrease the nutritional value and the antioxidant property of the beans.
4: This can negatively affect the potential health benefits arising from the consumption of cocoa beans.
5: For example, high processing temperature can promote lipid oxidation and non-enzymatic browning, which have the property to decrease the nutritional value of foods by causing a loss of essential fatty acids, essential aminoacids and digestible carbohydrates.
6: They also lead to the destruction of vitamins and the reduction of protein digestibility  [8].
7: Besides affecting the nutritional and organoleptic properties of the beans and final products, they may generate toxic compounds which are harmful for the consumers  [9].
0: Cameroon is the fifth worldwide and the fourth African cocoa producer.
1: In Cameroon, the crop is cultivated in almost all regions.
2: The seeds are used for industrial and local production of chocolate, cocoa butter, cocoa tea, other sweets etc or eaten directly after roasting.
0: Several studies have been reported on the effects of processing temperature and time on the nutritional value and phenolic content of edible seeds [ 10,  11].
1: In spite of the studies that have already been conducted on cocoa beans, there is almost no report on the effects of processing temperature and time on its phenolic content, antioxidant activity, lipid quality, proximate composition and mineral content.
2: In one study, Rocha et al .
3: [12] have demonstrated the impact of the roasting temperature and time of cocoa beans on the sensory characteristics and acceptability of chocolate.
4: Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the effect of oven and traditional roasting on the polyphenols content, antioxidant activity, lipid quality and nutritional value of fermented cocoa beans.

1: Introduction
0: Free radicals are naturally present in the living organism, and they include reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) [ 1].
1: They are produced during metabolism of energy in the cell as a result of the reduction of oxygen with one electron which forms superoxide anion (O 2) and with 2 or 3 electrons which forms H 2O 2 by the action of enzymes such as oxidases and with production of hydroxyl radical (OH ).
2: Furthermore, nitric oxide (NO) with anionic superoxide (O 2) gives peroxynitrite (ONOO ), which is RNS [ 2].Pollutions of air and water, toxins, drugs, heavy metals, pesticides, and cigarette smoke play an important role in the production of ROS [ 3].
0: When the ROS present in physiological concentration, they play an important role in the maintenance and the functioning of the body, but when their production exceeds the capacity of the cells to trap them, they start a state of oxidation called oxidative stress [ 4].
0: When the oxidative stress is moderate, the intervention of endogenous antioxidant systems of the organism can handle the situation to return to the physiological state.
1: However, when oxidative stress becomes chronic, it leads to the appearance of several diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes and cancer [ 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11].
0: Exogenous antioxidants such as vitamin E and C, phenolics, flavonoids, flavonols, flavones and carotenoids have been found to mitigate the activity of the endogenous antioxidant defense and can protect against diseases that result from oxidative stress [ 12].
0: Argania spinosa (Sapotaceae) is an endemic tree of south-western Morocco, which gives valuable Argan oil.
1: The extraction of this oil was made by three methods: (i) a traditional method which is very slow and produces oil with an insufficient quality of conservation due to the water added during the process of extraction; (ii) a mechanical press which does not require the addition of water during extraction; and (iii) a solvent extraction method which produces oil with unsatisfactory organoleptic properties compared to the oil extracted by traditional method or by mechanical press.
2: This technique is exclusively used to prepare the oil for cosmetic purposes [ 13, 14].
0: Argan oil is rich in antioxidant compounds such as caffeic acid, vanillic acid, ferulic acid, resorcinol and catechin [ 15].
1: Several studies have shown that Argan oil has beneficial effects against many diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, obesity, cancer, and diabetes [ 16, 17, 18, 19, 20].
0: Essential oil is an odorous product of organic compounds found naturally in aromatic plants, and it is obtained by hydro distillation, steam distillation, and pressing techniques [ 21, 22].
1: The clove ( Syzygium aromaticum) is a tree from ( Myrtaceae) family, and its essential oil has been reported to be one of the strongest essential oil in its antioxidant activity; this is due to the chemical composition especially eugenol.
0: Several studies have shown that exposure to H 2O 2 is an effective technique for inducing oxidative stress in animals.
1: H 2O 2 can cause elevation of OH  via the Fenton reaction: Fe 2+ + H 2O 2  Fe 3+ +  OH + OH  [ 23, 24, 25, 26].
0: In this context, the present study was designed to explore the antioxidant content of Argan oil and  Syzygium aromaticum essential oil, and to investigate the protective effect of Argan oil administered alone and the effect of the formulation of  Syzygium aromaticum essential oil emulsified in Argan oil against the harmful toxicity induced by H 2O 2.
0: INTRODUCTION
0: The main goal of modern dentistry is to maintain the function of the masticatory system throughout one's life.
1: This goal is hard to achieve without endodontic therapy in most patients.
2: [ 1]  Enterococci are responsible for most of the primary infections of the root canal system.
3: They have been isolated from many treated root canals with chronic apical periodontitis and failed root canal treatment.
4: [ 2] These bacteria are capable of invading the dentinal tubules.
5: They can tolerate different ecological conditions, well adapt to unfavorable intracanal environment, and are multidrug resistant.
6: Enterococci are highly sensitive to sodium hypochlorite and also chlorhexidine (CHX).
7: However, their sensitivity decreases with a reduction in the concentration of these antimicrobial agents.
8: [ 3] Since inadequate cleaning and shaping as well as debris pushed into the root canal are among the factors responsible for root canal treatment failure, different irrigating solutions are used for cleaning and disinfection of the root canal system.
9: [ 4] Irrigating solutions must have low cytotoxicity and surface tension, adequate flow, and sustained antimicrobial activity.
10: Moreover, they must be easily accessible and affordable and have a pleasant odor.
11: An irrigating solution with high antimicrobial activity and insignificant adverse effects is obviously preferred.
12: [ 5]
0: Due to extensive antimicrobial activity, CHX has several applications in dentistry, and due to strong antimicrobial activity, relatively long substantivity, and lack of toxicity, CHX is considered a favorable irrigating solution for root canals.
1: However, its frequent use results in dental stains, burning sensation of the mucosa, xerostomia, gingival desquamation, impaired taste, and adverse systemic complications if swallowed accidentally.
2: [ 6] Since there are numerous side effects of chemical agents and emerging resistance of bacteria to these agents, researchers have been in search of herbal products with antimicrobial, antifungal, and anticancer properties since herbal medications often have minimal side effects and are affordable.
3: However, studies on the properties of organic compounds for dental applications are not many.
4: Four medicinal plants harvested in Iran with significant antibacterial properties, which have been traditionally used for the treatment of oral and dental conditions, are evaluated in this study.
0: Prangos ferulacea (PF) is native to Iran and possesses significant pharmaceutical, nutritional, and antioxidant properties.
1: Strong antibacterial properties of this plant against several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria have been previously confirmed.
2: [ 789]  Ziziphora tenuior (ZT) grows on mountain slopes.
3: [ 10] The extract of some species of this plant such as  Ziziphora clinopodioides and  Ziziphora persica is capable of preventing the growth of a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic microorganisms.
4: [ 111213]  Ferula gummosa (FG) has extensive antibacterial properties as well.
5: [ 14] Essential oil of the seeds of this plant has strong antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria such as  Enterococcus faecalis and  Staphylococcus aureus.
6: [ 15]  Dracocephalum moldavica (DM) has a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity against pathogens such as  Streptococcus mutans, Micrococcus luteus, S. aureus, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, and  Bacillus subtilis.
7: [ 16]
0: To the best of authors' knowledge, no previous study has evaluated the antibacterial activity of the aforementioned four medicinal plants against oral and dental pathogens.
1: Thus, this study aimed to compare the antibacterial effects of PF, ZT, FG, and DM essential oils in comparison with CHX on  E. faecalis.
0: In this  in vitro study the plants were collected from Zanjan City, Iran, identified in the herbarium of Zanjan University of Medical Sciences and dried in shade.
1: Essential oils were extracted using the Clevenger apparatus via the distillation method.
2: Analysis of the essential oil was carried out using gas chromatography/mass chromatography.

0: Mosquitoes are vectors of many tropical and subtropical pathogens that may cause severe health problems in countries where they are endemic [ 1].
1: Specifically,  Anopheles species vector malaria worldwide.
2: Aedes aegypti and  Ae.
3: albopictus are primary carriers for viruses that cause dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, chikungunya fever, yellow fever, and Zika [ 2, 3].
4: Culex quinquefasciatus, a vector of lymphatic filariasis, is widely distributed in tropical regions [ 4].
5: Lymphatic filariasis is possibly the most rapidly spreading mosquito vector-borne disease to humans in many part of the world and, worldwide, 146 million people suffer from lymphatic filariasis transmitted by  Cx.
6: quinquefasciatus [ 5].
7: Chemical pyrethroids have been relied upon as the insecticides of choice for mosquito control, due to their low mammalian toxicity and quick knockdown activity.
8: In many parts of the world, mosquito vectors have developed resistance against the synthetic chemical insecticides, thus rendering their use for control in some areas ineffective [ 6, 7, 8, 9].
0: Nature provides several bioactive compounds for the control of mosquitoes, namely plant-derived products, marine algal-derived products, microbial-derived products, and other biological compounds.
1: The use of biological-derived products of plant origin is recommended because they are effective, environmentally friendly, and generally have a low toxicity [ 10].
2: Plant oils have rich sources of secondary bioactive metabolites that can be obtained from the nonwoody parts, particularly leaves and seeds through steam distillation or hydrodistillation.
3: Essential oils are rich in species belonging to Rutaceae, Asteraceae, Umbelliferae, Myrtaceae, and Lamiaceae families [ 11].
4: The plant-derived oils have biological activities, namely antibacterial, antifungal, antifeedant, as well as insecticidal activities [ 12, 13].
5: Plant-based essential oil and crude extract have strong ovicidal activity against mosquito eggs [ 14] and larvicidal activity [ 15, 16, 17].
6: Biotoxicity of neem cake extract shows strong insecticidal activity against mosquitoes [ 18].
7: Many research studies have evaluated the use and efficacy of natural plant products against arthropod pests [ 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22].
8: A previous report showed that  Coriandrum sativum (Apiaceae) essential oil shows strong insecticidal activity against  A. albopictus (larvae LC 50 was 421 ppm and LC 90 was 531 ppm)[ 15].
9: Dhanasekaran et al.
10: [ 23] also reported that actinobacterial extract shows remarkable larvicidal activity against mosquitoes.
11: Cassia fistula L flower ethyl acetate crude extract shows strong pesticidal activity against Lepidopteran pests [ 24].
0: Several laboratory evaluations have reported the use of plant secondary metabolites and essential oils against larval and adult mosquitoes [ 12, 25, 26, 27].
1: Vachellia nilotica, widely known as  Acacia nilotica, belongs to the Fabaceae family, and is present in India and other parts of the world.
2: This plant is used as medicine for humans and animals.
3: Chronic larval toxicity from  A. nilotica stem bark acetone extracts against major mosquito species has been reported by Chaubal et al.
4: [ 28].
5: Acute toxicity of acetone leaf extracts of  A. nilotica at 212.1 mg/L and chronic toxicity at 144.2 mg/L was observed in larval  Cx.
6: pipiens; in addition, these extracts have shown the ability to suppress egg hatchability and adult emergence [ 29].
0: Commercial available plant-derived essential oils and secondary metabolites are very effective as for good repellents and their insecticidal agents can be incorporated into integrated vector control approaches [ 30].
1: A. nilotica seed pods are reported to contain saponins, terpenes, and tannins, all of which display antiparasitic activity [ 31].
2: Although  A. nilotica crude extracts have insecticidal activity [ 29, 31], there are no reports of seed pod extracts and seed essential oils being used as mosquito control agents.
3: Therefore, the objective of our study was to investigate the mosquitocidal activity of seed oil and seed pod solvent extracts of  A. nilotica against three important mosquito vectors.

1: Introduction
0: Burn, one of the most common household injuries, is defined as a type of damage of skin or other tissues caused by exposure to heat, chemicals, electric currents, flame, hot liquid, hot metal or object, steam, radiation from X-ray, sunlight, ultraviolet, and so forth.
1: Among them, the thermal injuries are leading cause of burn (86%), followed by electrical sources (4%) and contacting with chemical sources (3%), and other sources of burns (7%) [ 1].
2: Note that flame and scald burns account for the majority of burns in children and adults.
3: Thermal burn causes not only a small or local injury which can be treated at home or outpatient but also the severe and fatal injuries which require the in-hospital treatment.
4: The World Health Organization estimates that thermal burns account for approximated 6.6 million injuries and 300 thousand deaths annually over the world [ 1].
5: Furthermore, Kemp et al.
6: (2017) also suggest that 25,000 children who suffered from burns or scald require the Emergency Department admission in English and Wales each year, of which 3,800 patients must receive in-hospital treatment [ 2].
7: The severity of burn is evaluated by the extent and the depth of burn.
8: The extent of burn is estimated through total body surface area burn (% TBSA) whereas the depth of burn is estimated by the deep extent of injury into the epidermis or dermis.
9: If the burn extent involves only the epidermis, thus it is classified as superficial burn (first degree).
10: When the burn involves epidermis and dermis, it is categorized as partial thickness burn (second degree).
11: The other burn is full-thickness burn (third degree) which extend into subcutaneous fat or deeper.
12: Thermal burns resulted in both local injuries and a systemic response, in case of severe burn (% TBSA > 20%).
13: Deep and widespread burns may cause many complications such as infection, hypovolemia, hypothermia, blood clotting, scarring, joint mobility problem, and posttraumatic stress disorder.
14: In superficial and partial thickness of burns, topical antibacterial regimes with antibiotic ointments or cream and/or absorbent dressing to cover the burn wound are recommended.
15: Otherwise, in deep partial and full thickness of burns, the surgical excision of damaged tissue and skin grafting are performed to cure the wound.
0: Several medical plants exerting antibacterial activity and/or wound healing potential have been applied for treating burn injuries such as  Aloe vera,  Achillea millefolium,  Carica papaya, and  Datura alba [ 10].
1: Herbal preparations may be obtained from a variety of parts of plants (fruit, leaf, bulb, stem, root, pollen, whole plant, and seed) and extraction forms (oil, acetone, methanol, ethanol, hydroalcoholic, and aqueous extract).
2: In Polynesia and Southeast Asia, tamanu oil which is produced from  Calophyllum inophyllum is the well-known and common use product to heal thermal burn wound.
3: Tamanu oil has been proven as promising topical remedy which exerts acceleration of skin healing process, antineuralgic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial effects [ 11].
4: Note that the number of researches using vegetable oil and essential oil to treat burn wound has been increased.
5: Dursun et al.
6: (2003) suggested that thymus essential oil could reduce NO level induced by burn and enhance the formation of new tissue in burn wound [ 12].
7: The beneficial effect of  Nigella sativa seed oil on burn wound healing process also was proven [ 13].
8: Furthermore, Khedir et al.
9: (2016) observed that  Pistacia lentiscus fruit oil accelerated wound contraction in CO 2 laser burned wound model [ 14].
10: These findings consolidate the idea using the vegetable and vegetable oils for treating burn wound.
0: Cleistocalyx operculatus (Roxb.)
1: Merr & Perry is a well-known medicinal plant in Asia.
2: It is grown and widely spread in Vietnam, China, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, Sri Lanka, India, Nepal, and other tropical countries.
3: Leaves and buds are two parts of  C. operculatus commonly used for treating gastrointestinal disorder and dermatophytic infection for many years [ 15].
4: Furthermore, the other beneficial effects of  C. operculatus such as anticancer, antihyperglycemic hypolipidemic, and cardiotonic effects are well documented [ 16,  17].
5: In addition, Dung et al.
6: (1994) have analyzed the chemical composition of essential oil isolated from  Cleistocalyx operculatus leaves [ 18].
7: Recently, Dosoky et al.
8: (2015) proved that essential oil of  Cleistocalyx operculatus leaves possessed a strong antimicrobial effect and cytotoxicity to cancer cell lines [ 19].
9: However, application of essential oil isolated from  Cleistocalyx operculatus leaves on wound healing, especially in thermal injury, has not been elucidated yet.
10: Therefore, we investigated the effect of essential oil isolated from  Cleistocalyx operculatus leaves on burn wound model in this study.

1: Introduction
0: The pumpkin ( Cucurbita spp.
1: ), one of the most popular vegetables consumed in the world, has been recently recognized as a functional food [ 1, 2, 3].
2: Pumpkin seeds, generally considered agro-industrial waste, are an extraordinarily rich source of bioactive compounds with interesting nutraceutical properties [ 4].
3: In recent years, several studies [ 5, 6, 7] have highlighted the health properties of pumpkin seed oil against many diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, and cancer.
4: It also shows antibacterial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties [ 8, 9].
5: Due to the presence of interesting natural bioactive compounds, such as carotenoids, tocopherols, and sterols, pumpkin-derived products have a wide spectrum of biological activity, proven by in vivo experiments [ 10].
0: Because of the positive health effects, research has been focused particularly on the content and composition of fatty acids (FA) and tocopherols in pumpkin seed oil, while, to a lesser extent, other lipid components, such as sterols, alcohols, and phenol acids, have been studied, as is done with other food matrices to identify specific markers characteristic of the plant varieties [ 11].
1: Among the relevant aspects to be considered when dealing with this vegetable, the beneficial effects of using environmentally friendly natural herbicides [ 12] must be mentioned, since the content of bioactive compounds could be affected, and there could be possible contamination of this vegetable due to the presence of  Fusarium spp.
2: microfungi and their secondary metabolites [ 13], affecting the content of beneficial compounds of the vegetable itself.
0: Stevenson et al.
1: [ 14] summarized FA composition and reported significant differences among various cultivars of pumpkin seed oil extracted from various pumpkin sources.
2: Rezig et al.
3: [ 15] studied the chemical composition and oil properties of seeds of a Tunisian variety of pumpkin, Bejaoui ( C. maxima).
4: They found that the major FA were oleic, linoleic, and palmitic acids and that the seed oil was rich in -tocopherol, while the sterol marker was -sitosterol and the predominant phenolic acid was syringic acid.
5: Siano et al.
6: [ 16] highlighted that saturated FA (SFA) and monounsaturated FA (MUFA) of  C. maxima produced in southern Italy showed similar values (25.20% and 25.54%, respectively), while the polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) content was 48.14%.
7: Habib et al.
8: [ 17] determined the proximate composition of powdered seed and the lipid composition of the oil of  C. maxima collected in Bangladesh.
9: They affirmed that the high degree of unsaturation makes the oil suitable for use as valuable drying agent, and lower free FA content indicates suitability of the oil for consumption as food.
0: Other researchers studied the chemical composition of pumpkin seed oils from  C. pepo [ 5, 18, 19, 20, 21].
1: Due to the differences among the species and/or varieties of  Cucurbita spp.
2: grown in different areas of the world, the present study focused on characterizing a native Italian cultivar ( C. maxima, var.
3: Berrettina, locally known as priests hat), paying attention to the lipid composition of the seed oil.
4: Since there is little information about the lipid structure, the present research deepens understanding of the total FA content and intrapositional composition of Berrettina pumpkin by using stereospecific analysis, and pays attention to other minor lipid components such as sterols, alcohols, and carotenoids.
5: Butinar et al.
6: [ 22] proposed high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of triacylglycerol (TAG) as a useful technique to evaluate the genuineness of pumpkin seed oils produced in Slovenia, but to the best of our knowledge, there are no data in the literature dealing with stereospecific analysis of pumpkin seed TAG.

1: Introduction
0: Propolis is a complex material of resinous consistency produced by bees which has a highly variable physical appearance, color, and consistency, depending on many factors such as geographic origin, types of vegetable sources, time of collection, and season of the year [ 1].
1: Bees use propolis to seal openings in the hive to avoid the entrance of intruders, to maintain a constant inner temperature, to contribute to the attainment of an internal aseptic environment, and overall to protect the hive from widespread bacterial infection [ 1, 2, 3, 4].
2: Propolis composition is extremely complex and variable, showing the presence of beeswax, resin, essential oils, and pollen.
3: Bees secrete the wax, while resin and oils are obtained from plants, usually taken from secretions or by cutting fragments of vegetative tissues.
0: The variations in the chemical composition and consequently in the biological activity of propolis, are associated with its type and geographic origin.
1: However, although propolis is a complex mixture, its biological activities are reported due to the presence of the flavonoids, phenolic acids, and ethers mainly obtained from plant-derived substances [ 5].
2: Hence, although propolis is obviously an animal product, a considerable proportion of its components responsible for biological activities are plant derived.
3: In fact, the resin contains most of the compounds found in extracts consumed by people from many countries as food complements, nutraceuticals, or alternative medicine.
4: In fact, propolis has been extensively used in folk medicine for many years, and there is substantial evidence to indicate that it has antiseptic, antifungal, antibacterical, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties [ 4, 5, 6, 7].
5: Current applications of propolis include over-the-counter preparations for cold syndrome (upper respiratory tract infections, common cold, flu-like infection), as well as dermatological preparations useful in wound healing, treatment of boils, acne, herpes simplex and genitalis, and neurodermatitis, among other ailments [ 4, 8].
6: These effects are exerted by the numerous, more than 300, known substances composing propolis [ 9].
0: Propolis, which is barely soluble in water, cannot be used as a raw material and it must be purified by extraction with solvents to remove the inert material and preserve the polyphenolic fraction.
1: These last compounds, flavonoids and phenolic acids, are considered to contribute more to the healing effects than the other propolis constituents [ 9].
2: Propolis extracts are more commonly obtained through conventional techniques, such as ethanolic or aqueous extraction or by Soxhlet [ 10, 11].
3: In fact, in commercial and supplemental health care products, propolis is added in the form of extracts which are obtained by soaking crushed propolis in organic solvent or water.
4: Moreover, in the last few years, different studies have shown the extraction with supercritical fluid as a possible alternative method to obtain compounds derived from natural matrices, including propolis [ 10].
0: Due to the very high molecular complex composition of propolis, the different extractive processes utilized and the various solvents available to produce the finished products, the evaluation of the total polyphenols extracted, as well as an accurate determination of the single species and of the derived families of compounds with similar chemical properties, are necessary to assure products rich in molecular species and still retaining biological properties.
1: In fact, despite the high number of compounds extracted, the yield of the extraction process is often lower, which could indicate a selectivity depending on the extractive process.
2: Moreover, the different solvents used to solubilize the extracted polyphenols from propolis may have a selective capacity to produce finished products which possess peculiar compositions and biological properties.
0: In this paper, we evaluated this aspect by dissolving a unique propolis extract in various solvents obtaining different finished products such as hydroalcoholic, glycolic, glyceric solutions, and oil, as well as a product in the form of powder.
1: The molecular composition of the different preparations was evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography-UV-electrospray ionization mass (HPLC-UV-ESI-MS) and the antioxidant activity determined by a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) anti-oxidant assay [ 12].
2: This is more important by considering that the finished products in various forms often require propolis dissolved in specific solvents and supporting matrixes.
3: Finally, up to now, very few data are available on propolis composition in glyceric and glycolic extracts and no information has ever been published on propolis in oil.

1: Introduction
0: In recent years, there has been a growing interest into the benefits of consuming insects, also known as entomophagy.
1: Instead of viewing insects, such as locusts, as pests that should be kept away from the kitchen, certain consumers and food companies are purposely and creatively incorporating them into food products and meals.
2: Migratory locusts ( Locusta migratoria, Linnaeus, 1758 (Orthoptera: Acrididae)) are prevalent in African and Arabian diets, but are also widespread across the world [ 1].
3: Popular preparations include fried, roasted, or boiled.
4: However, there are over 2000 edible insect species that can be eaten at egg, larval, pupal, or adult stages, either whole or ground up into meals or snack products [ 2].
5: Locusts are historically associated as pests that destroy crops, which has influenced research and consumer opinions.
6: In recent years however, through growing interest concerning entomophagy, locusts have received attention for their promising sensory properties, nutritionally rich composition, and sustainable production prospects as a food ingredient [ 1, 2].
0: Rearing locusts and other edible insects requires significantly less feed, land, and water compared to livestock production, which is known to have a significant impact on the environment where greenhouse gas emissions are minimal with only cockroaches, termites and scarab beetles that emit methane gas [ 2, 3].
1: Locusts have short life cycles in which adulthood can be reached at four to eight weeks depending on rearing conditions.
2: They can also increase their numbers 10 to 16-fold between each generation, illustrating the rapid and efficient domestic rearing prospects [ 1].
3: Land required for rearing is minimal as they can be farmed vertically.
4: The cold-blooded insects obtain moisture from their food decreasing water requirements, and along with the high feed conversion efficiency, insects resource requirements are lower compared to other traditional livestock such as beef [ 2].
0: Moreover, locusts are nutritionally rich in protein, fiber, and essential fatty acids.
1: Compositional data concerning locusts is scarce and exact values are highly variable depending on species, habitat, diet, metamorphic stage, and processing method.
2: Orthopteran species contain high amounts of fat averaging around 13% (dry weight basis), with promising amounts of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA); omega-3 (-linolenic acid) and omega-6 (linoleic acid) [ 4].
3: Moreover, insects are particularly noted for their high protein content.
4: Orthopteran species can range from 15% to 81% protein [ 5], with averages around 50% to 65% for  Locusta migratoria [ 6, 7, 8].
5: Orthopteran species also contain satisfactory ratios of essential amino acids recommended for human consumption, making them a sustainable protein option for consumers looking for alternatives to traditional meat sources such as beef [ 5].
6: Yet, some studies have recognised the potential overestimation of insect protein contents when the nitrogen to protein conversion for meat (6.25) is used [ 9, 10, 11].
7: The high amount of chitin, a non-protein nitrogen (NPN) polysaccharide found in the exoskeleton of insects, can cause an overestimation of digestible protein documented in literature.
8: To more accurately determine insect protein content, Jonas-Levi and Martinez [ 10] recommended subtracting NPN from the total nitrogen content, or lowering the conversion factor.
9: Nonetheless, the high protein and fat content of insects and locusts is comparable to traditional meat sources, indicating potential as a meat or protein alternative for the growing population [ 2, 12].
0: Furthermore, extracting the protein from insects has been suggested as a worthwhile practice [ 2].
1: Not only does it increase the protein content (per 100 g) and digestibility for certain fractions [ 13], it can overcome initial consumer acceptance barriers.
2: Many studies have found consumers are more willing to eat insects when they cannot be seen [ 14], illustrating opportunities as an value-added ingredient as opposed to a whole insect.
3: Protein extraction is usually carried out via aqueous or alkali isoelectric precipitation, in which different pH, temperature, and physical separation (centrifugation) methods are used to separate different fractions [ 15].
4: These fractions include a layer comprising of water insoluble proteins and other constituents, and a layer of protein water soluble proteins.
5: Each fraction is different in terms of yield, chemical composition, digestibility, colour, and functionality.
6: Consequently, insoluble and soluble proteins have different potential applications as an ingredient.
7: To the authors knowledge, only a small number of studies have explored any of these parameters, which include analysis of house crickets  (Acheta domesticus), black solider flies  (Hermeia illucens), yellow mealworms  (Tenebrio molitor), Mexican fruit fly larvae  (Anastepha ludens) and migratory locusts ( Locusta migratoria) [ 11, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19].
0: Insects in New Zealand, including locusts, are classified as novel food by Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ), with the exception of three species, due to lack of safety concerns.
1: Studies have found microbial and fungal loads of fresh insects are reasonably high [ 20, 21, 22].
2: However, processing steps such as blanching, heat treatments, and sterilization are sufficient methods to reduce safety risks in various insect species [ 20, 22, 23].
0: Presently, there are only a few commercial insect products sold on the Western market, which include ground insect flour (often cricket), sold on its own or incorporated into bars, chips, protein powders, cookies and even pasta.
1: Locusts are less popular and very few products have utilised extracted insect protein as an ingredient.
2: Even with the promising potential of locusts as an alternative food or protein source, consumers must first be accepting of the idea.
3: Entomophagy is practiced by over two billion people in mostly African, Asian, and Latin American societies [ 2].
4: Nevertheless, in areas where they are not traditionally consumed, such as Western culture, eating insects is met with great resistance, surfacing feelings of disgust and fear [ 24].
5: Enculturation of viewing animal products as a protein and fat source, and viewing insects as a pest that people try to avoid, has caused avoidance of novel insect products, also known as food neophobia.
6: In order to successfully introduce locust products, greater understanding of the locust protein properties could help the limited research and industrial product development, in the hope to improve adoption in the future.
7: Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the proximate and fatty acid composition of the adult migratory locusts ( Locusta migratoria) and the properties, yield, and composition of extracted protein fractions via alkali isoelectric precipitation methodology.

1: Introduction
0: A large proportion of human population is exposed to infectious diseases spread by mosquitoes, including  Culex spp.,  Anopheles spp.
1: and  Aedes spp., which are vectors of parasitic diseases [ 1].
2: Culex quinquefasciatus Say is a vector of lymphatic filariasis.
3: The disease is widely distributed in tropical regions, with around 150 million people infected, ranking filariasis as one of the main causes of global morbidity [ 2].
4: Culex quinquefasciatus is present in tropical areas, a household pest in many urban settings, and widely reported as a vector resistant to registered insecticides [ 3].
0: Tropical areas are more prone to vector-borne parasitic diseases and the risk has increased due to the intensification of globalization [ 4].
1: Changes in climatic conditions due to global warming have promoted favorable conditions (temperature and humidity) for the development of mosquito populations, including hematophagous species.
2: Poor sanitary conditions for water storage intended to household use, as well as unsanitary management of urban solid waste, can increase mosquito populations in urban and rural areas [ 1].
0: On the other hand, the intensive use of synthetic insecticides in mosquito control programs has created resistance in the insect population [ 5], undesirable effects on other insects [ 6] and negative impacts on the environment [ 7].
1: Although the use of insecticide is the main method in the global effort for mosquito control [ 8], vector-borne diseases are persistent due to mosquitoes resistant to traditionally used insecticides [ 9] and lack of effective vaccines [ 10].
2: The resistance of mosquitoes to synthetic insecticides has led to an interest in natural products with potential insecticidal activity, especially those derived from plants, which are considered valid alternatives to conventional synthetic pesticides to control a variety of insect pests and vectors.
3: In this context, the essential oils and their constituents have received much attention as potentially useful bioactive compounds against insects [ 11].
4: The complex and variable mixtures of bioactive compounds with different modes of action, offered by plants, may lessen the chance of resistance in mosquito populations [ 12].
0: Essential oils are heterogeneous mixtures of organic chemical compounds from different chemical families [ 13]; many have a terpenoid backbone, especially monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes.
1: Low molecular weight aliphatic compounds, acyclic esters or lactones may also be present [ 14].
2: Chemical composition of essential oils is affected by factors such as plant species and subspecies, geographical location, harvest time, part of the plant used and the extraction methods used to obtain the essential oil [ 15].
3: Several studies have reported the larvicidal action of medicinal plants and their essential oils against insect vectors of  Culex and  Anopheles genera, as well as  Aedes aegypti (L.) [ 16, 17].
4: Furthermore, there are many secondary metabolites found in most of those plants that are considered to have insecticidal properties [ 18, 19].
0: The aim of this paper is to determine, by laboratory bioassays, the larvicidal activity of seven essential oils on third instar larva and pupa of  C. quinquefasciatus.
1: Essential oils tested include cinnamon ( Cinnamomum verum J. Presl), Mexican lime ( Citrus aurantifolia Swingle) cumin ( Cuminum cyminum Linnaeus), clove ( Syzygium aromaticum (L.) Merr.
2: & L.M.
3: Perry), laurel ( Laurus nobilis Linnaeus), Mexican oregano ( Lippia berlandieri Schauer) and anise ( Pimpinella anisum Linnaeus) .
4: Larvicidal effect and synergistic behavior of the major components present in the essential oils included in the study are also tested.

1: Introduction
0: Conradina A.
1: Gray (Lamiaceae) is a small genus of morphologically distinctive, narrow-leaved, minty-aromatic shrubs endemic to the southeastern United States of America (USA) [ 1].
2: It consists of six to nine US native species.
3: According to the Plant List database [ 2] and Integrated Taxonomic Information Species (ITIS), the acceptable number of species for the genus is only six ( Conradina canescens A.
4: Gray,  C. cygniflora C.E.
5: Edwards, Judd, Ionta & Herring,  C. etonia Kral & McCartney,  C. glabra Shinners,  C. grandiflora Small and  C. verticillata Jennison) while  C. brevifolia Shinners,  C. montana Small and  C. puberula Small are considered synonyms of other species.
6: The Missouri Botanical Garden, however, lists nine distinct species [ 3].
7: Conradina species are characterized by very dense hairs on their lower leaf surfaces and by a sharply bent corolla tube in the flowers [ 1, 4].
8: Asa Gray established the genus  Conradina in 1870, named for the American botanist Solomon White Conrad [ 5].
9: Conradina species grow well in xeric habitats with well-drained sandy soils.
10: It is thought that  Conradina may be a pioneer species in disturbed areas since it has the ability to colonize xeric disturbed habitats [ 1, 5].
0: Each species of  Conradina occupies a separate geographical region [ 1, 6].
1: Five of the species are endemic to Florida, one is native to west Florida, south Alabama, and south Mississippi, and one is endemic to north-central Tennessee and Kentucky ( Figure 1).
2: Due to habitat destruction from residential, commercial, and agricultural land conversions and their very restricted distribution, three of these species are on the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) federal list as endangered ( Conradina brevifolia,  C. glabra, and  C. etonia) [ 5], one as threatened ( C. verticillata) [ 6] and two species are considered candidates for listing as endangered ( C. grandiflora and  C. cygniflora).
0: The aim of the present review is to summarize the literature in order to document secondary metabolites that characterize and differentiate between  Conradina species.
1: We shall also assess the reported biological activities of  Conradina species, with particular focus on their phylogenetic affinities and anti-microbial, anti-leishmanial and cytotoxic properties.
0: Introduction
0: Anisakiasis is a fish-borne parasitic disease; it is caused by the consumption of raw or undercooked fish, as well as cephalopods, contaminated by third instar larvae of species belonging to the genus  Anisakis (Anisakidae), with special reference to  Anisakis simplex,  Anisakis pegreffii and  Pseudoterranova decipiens (Grabda  1976; Mattiucci and Nascetti  2006; Audicana and Kennedy  2008; Pravettoni et al.
1: 2012) .
2: After ingestion, the larvae penetrate the gastric and intestinal mucosa, causing the symptoms of anisakiasis (Broglia and Kapel  2011).
3: Recently, it has been estimated that about 20,000 cases of anisakiasis are reported per year worldwide.
4: The large majority of the cases is from Japan (> 90%), due to the traditional use of  sashimi as food.
5: Other countries characterized by a rather large number of anisakiasis cases are Spain, the Netherlands, Germany and Scandinavia (Bao et al.
6: 2017).
0: Live larvae of  A. simplex can cause a parasitic infection of the digestive tract.
1: In addition, they can also affect other organs causing erosive and/or haemorrhagic lesions, ascites and perforations until granulomas and masses, if the larvae are not promptly removed.
2: Furthermore, the presence of larvae of  A. simplex can lead to allergic reactions, as anaphylaxis, acute/chronic urticaria and angioedema (Asturias et al.
3: 2000; Nieuwenhuizen et al.
4: 2003; Berger and Marr  2006; Choi et al.
5: 2009; Pravettoni et al.
6: 2012).
7: Notably, the larvae of  A. simplex can induce an immune adaptive response characterized by T-lymphocyte proliferation with polyclonal and monoclonal (which are responsible for allergic symptoms), IgE production, eosinophilia and mastocytosis (Park et al.
8: 2009; Pravettoni et al.
9: 2012).
0: Nowadays, the endoscopic removal of live larvae still represents the main effective treatment against anisakiasis (Sugita et al.
1: 2008; Pravettoni et al.
2: 2012).
3: Furthermore, protection against anisakiasis can be enhanced educating consumers about the risks linked with eating raw or undercooked seafood.
4: From a pharmacological point of view, antibiotics, anticholinergics and/or corticosteroids have been employed for the treatment of anisakiasis, showing patchy and limited efficacy (Matsui et al.
5: 1985).
6: However, a relevant exception is represented by albendazole (Dziekonska-Rynko et al.
7: 2002; Romero et al.
8: 2014), since it has been recently showed that this compound dose-dependently reduced (500 g/ml led to 100% 48 h post-treatment) the survival of  A. simplex third instar larvae (Arias-Diaz et al.
9: 2006).
10: However, it has been noted that acidic medium pH reduced its efficacy (Arias-Diaz et al.
11: 2006).
12: In this scenario, there is an urgent need to develop novel and effective tools and drugs for the treatment of  A. simplex parasitic infections (Molina-Garcia and Sanz  2002; Brutti et al.
13: 2010), including the use of natural products (Hierro et al.
14: 2004,  2006; Lin et al.
15: 2010; Gomez-Rincon et al.
16: 2014; Valero et al.
17: 2015).
0: Essential oils, which are complex mixtures of volatile components such as monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids (Pavela and Benelli  2016), can represent a new strategy to combat several parasites including L3 larvae of  A. simplex (Giarratana et al.
1: 2014; Hierro et al.
2: 2004; Romero et al.
3: 2012).
4: In this regard,  Origanum essential oils have been shown to possess in vivo efficacy against larvae of  Anisakis (Perez et al.
5: 2016; Abattouy et al.
6: 2010).
7: On this basis, we focused our attention on the essential oil obtained from  Origanum compactum Benth., belonging to the Lamiaceae family.
0: O. compactum is a small herbaceous aromatic plant endemic to Spain and Morocco (Emberger and Maire  1941) where it is particularly appreciated in cuisine to enhance the flavour of foods and as natural food preservative (Ghanmi et al.
1: 2015; Sbayou et al.
2: 2014).
3: O. compactum enjoys a long-standing use in the traditional medicine as well as a good reputation and economic importance in the trade of medicinal and aromatic plants (Briguiche and Zidane  2016; Bouiamrine et al.
4: 2017).
5: In Morocco, the plant, locally known as  Zaetar, is used under infusion to treat heart and intestinal pains or as preservative for foodstuffs (El-Hilaly et al.
6: 2003).
7: It is also a famous remedy for the treatment of wounds, diabetes, hypertension and cardiac diseases, digestive and respiratory problems and gastrointestinal and gingival cancers (Ziyyat et al.
8: 1997; Jouad et al.
9: 2001; Kabbaj et al.
10: 2012; Eddouks et al.
11: 2002; Bouhdid et al.
12: 2009; Jamila and Mostafa  2014).
13: O. compactum has also been used as vermifuge, aphrodisiac, antispasmodic, antiulcer, laxative and antidiarrheal agent (Hmamouchi et al.
14: 2000; Jamila and Mostafa  2014).
0: In the search of scalable products to use as treatments of anisakiasis, we here evaluated the activity of  O. compactum essential oil as well as its major constituents carvacrol and thymol on  A. simplex L3 larvae.
1: The pharmacological mechanism was studied through the inhibitory activity of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme, which plays a crucial role in the nematode neuromuscular function.

1: Introduction
0: The Lamiaceae family of plants is a major source of polyphenols and pharmacological properties described in the literature.
1: Belonging to the Lamiaceae family,  Lavandula angustifolia is indigenous to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean, with many therapeutic properties and biological activities [ 1].
0: Phytochemical studies revealed that the major constituents of  Lavandula angustifolia essential oil (LEO) are 1,8-cineole, camphor, and endo-borneol.
1: Other components can also be found in minor quantities, such as  -pinene, camphene,  -pinene,  -pinene, p-cymene, limonene, terpinen-4-ol, and cryptone [ 2,  3].
2: However, the LEO composition may vary depending on the geographical origin of the plant material and environmental factors, such as geographical conditions, climate and seasonal variations, and the stage of the plant growth, and the extraction and detection methods also influence the LEO composition [ 4].
0: The extracts and  Lavandula angustifolia essential oil have various pharmacological effects described in the literature, such as anticonvulsant [ 5], anxiolytic [ 6], antioxidant, anticholinesterase [ 7,  8], antimicrobial [ 9], and antifungal activities [ 10].
1: Additionally, various constituents in the oil also have valuable pharmacological properties, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial [ 11 14].
0: Inflammation is a complex biological process involving vascular, cellular components and a variety of soluble substances, presenting as characteristic clinical signs: redness, heat, swelling, pain, and function loss [ 15].
1: The purpose of the inflammatory process is the elimination of the aggressive agent and consequences of tissue injury [ 16].
2: The leukocytes recruitment is essential in the acute inflammatory response, where cells act as the first line of defense in the initiation of the inflammatory process, and involves the participation of several inflammatory mediators [ 17], produced by inflammatory cells that play an important role in maintaining the inflammatory response [ 18].
0: Natural products and their essential oils have been popularly used for the treatment of various inflammatory diseases and the development of new therapeutic strategies.
1: Studies suggest that the use of natural products may be safer and more effective since they have low toxicity and few side effects [ 19].
2: Thus, the objective of this research was to investigate the LEO activity in acute inflammation, using different experimental models.
0: Background
0: Marine environments continue to be exposed to oil pollution events as oil and gas production activities continue to expand [ 1].
1: Accidental and operational releases of crude oil remain a threat to marine biota, including fish, therefore monitoring activities play an important role.
2: Atlantic cod ( Gadus morhua) is a commonly used fish species in environmental monitoring in the North Atlantic [ 2].
3: For this species, the adverse effects of oil exposure, in particular, the damage caused by petrogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)  a class of compounds found in crude oil and oil products  is well documented [ 3,  4].
4: In addition, several biomarkers of petrogenic PAH exposure are well-established for this species [ 3,  5].
5: PAHs found in crude oil are well-known carcinogens due to their ability to form DNA and protein adducts following their primary metabolism in the liver [ 6,  7].
6: Liver enzymes initiate the excretion process of PAHs by transforming them into more water soluble conjugated metabolites, which are sometimes more toxic than their corresponding parent PAHs [ 8,  9].
7: The conjugated metabolites are then excreted via the bile into the intestinal tract.
8: The fate of conjugated metabolites in the intestinal tract and their effect on the gut microbiota is still under investigation.
9: It is generally assumed that conjugated biliary PAH metabolites either (1) pass through the gut unchanged and are eliminated via feces, or (2) are hydrolyzed spontaneously, reabsorbed through the intestinal wall and transported to the liver via the portal vein (enterohepatic recirculation) [ 10].
10: Considering the metabolic diversity of the gut microbiota, conjugated metabolites could also undergo biotransformation as a result of bacterial activity in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract [ 11].
11: Moreover, there might be mechanisms that exacerbate the toxic effects of pollutants by for example reactivating conjugated biliary metabolites [ 12].
12: Studies on the potential interactions between biliary metabolites and gut microbiota in fish are scarce, and most microbiota studies have so far been carried out on mammals, e.g., mice and humans [ 13,  14].
13: Their results indicate that gut microbiota can indeed be actively involved in biotransformation of environmental pollutants.
14: Such biotransformation may influence the detoxification process and alter the fate of xenobiotic compounds.
15: At the same time, these pollutants can in return influence the composition of the gut microbiota.
0: The species composition, richness and diversity of the fish gut microbiome has been studied extensively in fish species that are interesting for the aquaculture industry mainly with the interest of improving fish health through enhanced feed.
1: Commonly used methods include cultivation and/or molecular profiling with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) [ 15].
2: Based on the increasing use of next-generation sequencing techniques a diverse gut microbiome composition has been detected in fish [ 16,  17].
3: While next-generation sequencing [ 18] indicated changes in the intestinal community of a freshwater fish (goldfish,  Carassius auratus) upon exposure to an environmental pollutant (pentachlorophenol), studies investigating such effect in marine fish are lacking.
4: Herein, we report the effect of oil exposure on the intestinal microflora in Atlantic cod.
5: The aim of this study was to assess the potential shift in gut bacterial community composition of Atlantic cod due to oil exposure.
6: The intestinal bacterial community composition, as analyzed by Illumina sequencing of V4 amplicons of bacterial 16S rRNA genes, was compared among gut microbiota of fish after a 28-day exposure to four levels of oil concentration (i.e., no oil, 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1 mg/L).
7: Results from biological effect measurement, i.e.
8: PAH metabolite analysis in fish bile, were used to confirm metabolic uptake of oil by the fish [ 2].

0: Introduction
0: The air-filled cavities of sinuses is one of host defense system, which act by classical, pseudostratified and ciliated columnar epithelium.
1: When one or more of paranasal sinuses become inflamed, sinusitis occurs.
2: Classically, there are four types of sinusitis including acute, sub-acute, chronic and recurrent ones.
3: The infection of paranasal sinuses, which occur 10 days and less than 4 weeks is defined as acute sinusitis.
4: The inflammatory diseases of sinuses, much similar to asthma is chronic sinusitis.
5: Viral upper respiratory infection leads to inflammation of sinuses, damaging the mucosa and defective performance of cilia, which prone the environment to bacterial infections 1.
6: Rhinoviruses,  Streptococcus pneumonia,  Haemophilus influenza, and  Moraxella catarrhalis are the majority pathogens of acute sinusitis  2,  3.
7: In spite of inflammatory nature of acute sinusitis, the involved bacterial pathogens of acute sinusitis,  Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative  Staphylococci are found in chronic sinusitis  4.
8: Postnasal drip, greenish nasal discharge, nasal congestion, tenderness of the face under the eyes or at the bridge of the nose, frontal headaches, pain in teeth, cough and fever are common symptoms of sinusitis.
9: Antibiotics (amoxicillin, doxycycline, cephalexin and cefadroxil, etc.)
10: are prescribed for 85-98% of patients with acute sinusitis  5,  6,  7.
11: Nasal corticosteroids, and anti-histamines are used in patients with sneezing or rhinitis.
12: Corticosteroids and antibiotics are used in chronic sinusitis  8.
13: The appearance of antibiotic resistant pathogens to chemical agents along with the adverse effects of drugs encourage the scientists to search among the medicinal plants.

1: Introduction
0: Oil production has been experiencing decline in many parts of the world due to oilfield's maturity and an example of such includes the major oilfields in the North Sea [ 1].
1: Another major concern is the increasing energy demands due to global population growth and the difficulty in discovering new oilfields as an alternative to the exploited oil fields.
2: Therefore, there is an urge to find out alternative technologies to increase oil recovery from existing oilfields around the world.
3: It is a fact that fossil fuels will still remain the key source of energy, regardless of the gross investments in other energy sources such as biofuels, solar energy, and wind energy.
4: This fact is highlighted by the current global energy production from fossil fuels which currently stand at about 8090% with oil and gas representing about 60% [ 2].
5: During oil production, primary oil recovery can account for 3040% oil productions, while additional 1525% can be recovered by secondary methods such as water injection leaving behind about 3555% of oil as residual oil in the reservoirs [ 3].
6: This residual oil is usually the target of many enhanced oil recovery technologies and it amounts to about 24 trillion barrels [ 4] or about 67% of the total oil reserves [ 5].
7: Residual oil recovery is at present necessitated for many oil companies and so there is a constant hunt for a cheap and efficient technology which will raise the global oil production as well as the productive life of many oilfields.
8: The recovery of this residual oil is accomplished by enhanced oil recovery (EOR) or tertiary recovery methods which are used in oil industry to increase the production of crude oil.
9: Indigenous or in situ microbial enhanced oil recovery (IMEOR) is one of the techniques in which the inhabitant microbes in the oil reservoirs were stimulated to enhance oil recovery [ 6].
10: IMEOR is reported as a cost-effective method [ 7].
11: The microbial community composition is influenced by oil reservoir geological conditions and other external factors like nutrient and water flooding, biosurfactant and biopolymer application, and steam injection [ 8].
0: For the advancement of a reliable MEOR protocol, understanding the microflora that exist in the oil reservoir is essential.
1: Conventional culture-based techniques have been widely used for bacterial identification and enumeration in oil fields.
2: Culture-based technique is selective and aids in the identification of only a few of the microbes.
3: The problem is even worsened in extreme environmental conditions such as oil fields, where only microbes that can withstand strict circumstances will survive.
4: Therefore, genomic analysis has become an important tool for understanding ecological biodiversity.
5: It evades the need for laboratory cultivation and isolation of individual isolates.
0: Complex environmental samples need some technique which can read multiple sequences in parallel.
1: Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) can obtain DNA sequences directly from environmental samples [ 9,  10].
2: In the study, the distribution of bacteria in steam-injected heavy oil wells (South Oman) with alkaline pH was characterized using high-throughput sequencing technique, Ion Torrent-Personal Genome Machine (PGM).
3: The spore-forming bacteria in the samples were also identified using culture-based method.
0: Introduction
0: Pelargonium roseum
0: Willd.
1: (Geraniaceae), is indigenous to Southern Africa, but due to its strong pleasant rose-like odor, it is widely grown as an ornamental plant in almost all parts of the world.
2: P. roseum has woody straight stems with short rough hairs covering leaves which give the plant a sweet scent (Lis-Balchin et al., 1996  , Carmen and Hancu, 2014  ).
3: Several bioactivities including antimicrobial, analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects were attributed to  P. roseum ( Rezai et al., 2008  ; Carmen and Hancu, 2014  ).
4: The antimicrobial efficacy of  P. roseum essential oil was tested on several Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria as well as fungi.
5: It was demonstrated that the essential oil of  P. roseum possesses antibacterial and antifungal activities (Carmen and Hancu, 2014  ).
0: Trichomonas gallinae, which is considered the cause of avian trichomoniasis is a flagellate located in the upper digestive and occasionally in the respiratory tracts of a large variety of birds, mainly in the orders Columbiformes and Falconiformes (Boal et al., 1998  ; Rouffaer et al., 2014  ).
1: Birds with avian trichomoniasis present caseous lesions within the anterior digestive tract.
2: The lesions range from mild, often subclinical infections, to sever inflammation which can be acute and fatal, and lead to death by starvation due to the obstruction of the lumen of the esophagus (Gerhold et al., 2008  ).
3: T. gallinae has significant health and economic impacts on the poultry industry especially pigeons and game birds rearing and breeding (Stockdale et al., 2015  ) and is considered a major contributing factor to the regulation and even decline of avian populations.
4: The drugs of choice for the treatment of trichomoniasis are nitroimidazoles.
5: Subtherapeutic doses and preventive use of these drugs against trichomoniasis, have resulted in emergence of resistant strains of  T. gallinae (Lumeij and Zwijnenberg, 1990  ).
0: Bearing all this in mind, the present study was designed to evaluate antitrichomonal effect of  P. roseum essential oil against  T. gallinae both  in vitro and  in vivo and to compare its effects to those of metronidazole as a standard antitrichomonal drug.
0: Statistical analysis
0: Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used, followed by Newman Keuls test as the  post hoc test to evaluate differences among means (SPSS ver.
1: 18).
2: A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
3: The growth inhibition percentage was determined using the following equation:
0: growth inhibition % = (A  B)/A  100
0: where A is the mean number of trophozoites in the control group and B is the mean number of trophozoites in the test group (Seddiek et al., 2014  ).
0: Materials
0: For preparation of  P. roseum essential oil (EO), aerial parts of the plant were collected from a herb garden (Kashan, Iran) during 2014.
1: The identity of the plant was confirmed by professor Rahimian, Sari Agricultural and Natural Resources University (Sari, Iran).
2: By using a Clevenger type apparatus, the essential oil of the plant was obtained by hydrodistillation.
3: Gas chromatographic mass spectrometric (GC-MS) analysis was performed using a Shimadzu GC-9A with helium as the carrier gas on a DB-5 column (30 m  0.25 mm i.d; film thickness 0.25 mm).
4: GCMS analysis was carried out on a Varian 3400 GCMS system with oven temperature set at 40-250C at a rate of 4C; transfer line temperature, 260C; carrier gas, helium with a linear velocity of 31.5 cm/s; split ratio, 1/60; ionization energy, 70 eV; scan time, 1 s: mass range, 40-300 amu.
0: Metronidazole (MTZ), (Alborz daru, Tehran, Iran) was used as a standard antitrichomonal agent.
1: All other chemicals used in the present study were of analytical grade.
0: Parasites
0: T. gallinae were recovered by wet mount method from infected native pigeons.
1: Forty native pigeons (6 to 8 weeks old) were purchased from local breeders in Babol city (Mazandaran Province, Iran).
2: By using swabs moistened with saline solution, samples were taken from membranous lesions of oropharyngeal region of suspicious birds.
3: To produce wet smears, swabs were rubbed over the surface of a microscope slide.
4: Smears were then examined under a light microscope at X100 and X400 magnification to confirm  T. gallinae as the causative agent of lesions.
5: Parasite culture was prepared by immersing oral swabs in tryptone/ yeast extract/ maltose (TYM) medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma, Germany) and incubated at 37C (Sansano-Maestre et al., 2009  ).
6: Cultures were observed over five consecutive days to check the growth of  T. gallinae.
7: Every 48 hr as the parasites in the logarithmic phase of growth presented more than 95% mobility and normal morphology, isolates were sub-cultured (Seddiek et al., 2014  ).
0: In vitro assay
0: For the  in vitro assay, we used the method described by Munoz et al., 1998 after making slight modifications.
1: To examine the susceptibilities of  T. gallinae toward  P. roseum EO and MTZ, sterile multi-well plates were used to incubate the trophozoites with different concentrations of the essential oil and drug dilutions.
2: A volume of 100 L of culture medium containing 1 10 4 parasites was pipetted into each well.
3: Also, prediluted MTZ and  P. roseum EO were added to wells to give final concentrations of 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 g/mL.
4: Tween 20 (0.01% of final concentration) was used as a solubilizing agent for  in vitro analysis.
5: Control wells received only Tween 20 without any treatments.
6: Subsequently, to generate anaerobic conditions, a layer of 50 L of vaseline was added to wells based on the method developed by Munoz et al., 1998.
7: All assays were done three times.
8: The wells were examined using an inverted microscope every 24 hr for 3 successive days.
9: The MIC was the lowest concentration of the drug in the well at which no motile parasite was observed.
0: In vivo assay
0: The protocol used for the  in vivo study was in accordance with laboratory animal welfare guide of Pasteur Institute of Iran and has been approved by the ethics committee.
1: Forty native pigeons ( >6 weeks old) were examined and confirmed to be free of  T. gallinae then experimentally infected with Trichomonas by inoculation of 4  10 4 trophozoites prepared in 1 mL of 48-hr culture medium.
2: Seven days post-infection, birds were examined and those that were diagnosed as infected with  T. gallinae, were randomly allocated into 5 groups as follows: the first group (CON) were infected but not medicated, EO 25 and EO 50 were the groups infected with  T. gallinae and medicated with 25 and 50 mg/kg of  P. roseum essential oil, respectively.
3: MTZ 25 and MTZ 50 groups were infected with  T. gallinae and medicated with 25 and 50 mg/kg of metronidazole, respectively.
4: All of the treatments were administered orally (PO) for 7 successive days.
5: Birds of different groups were located in separate wire cages and fed with semisolid mixed grains diet in order to prevent starvation due to difficulty in swallowing because of trichomoniasis.
6: The numbers of motile trophozoites recovered from the infected birds, were determined every day for seven consecutive days.
0: Introduction
0: Fossil assemblages in amber provide a unique and exceptionally-well preserved record of small, soft-bodied organisms that are not typically preserved through other mechanisms of fossilization [ 1].
1: The importance of this fossil reserve is best illustrated in what it has revealed about the evolutionary history of insects: for example, it provides evidence for macroevolutionary patterns such as a mid-Cretaceous transition between two major insect evolutionary faunas, which corresponds with the gymnosperm-angiosperm shift [ 1].
2: Furthermore, preservation fidelity in amber is such that insects retain micron-scale morphological details allowing for accurate comparative anatomical studies with extant taxa: many fossil insects preserved in amber can be confidently placed into modern taxonomic groups on this basis.
0: However, the fossil record in amber is subject to bias, which may limit and distort the extent to which the fossil assemblage represents the living assemblage.
1: There are two components to this bias: entrapment bias, which involves the non-random patterns by which organisms become engulfed in resin; and preservation bias, effectively the non-random patterns by which entrapped organisms decay or fossilize.
2: To date research effort has focused on entrapment into the resin [ 1 8], and a number of variables such as resin viscosity, insect behaviour and habitat and plant defences have been found to be influential [ 1,  2].
3: For example, fossil assemblages in amber favour the preservation of small, terrestrial inclusions, because these are most easily entrapped in resin flows [ 1,  2,  4].
4: Subsequent to entrapment and entombment in resin it has been suggested that essentially all organisms are preserved [ 2].
5: However, recent advances in 3D scanning techniques have revealed a cryptic and surprising variability of preservation quality of internal anatomy, even where external preservation quality is close-to life-like.
6: The variation ranges from internally complete fossils, retaining minute details of the most decay-prone tissues, through to fossils preserving only the most decay resistant features, to some which are hollow moulds.
7: This indicates that decay and preservation biases are operating once carcasses are entombed in resin [ 1,  2,  9,  10].
8: Such bias may responsible for some of the patterns in the amber fossil record that cannot be explained by entrapment; for example, the occurrence of non-fossiliferous amber sites [ 1,  2], and taxa whose overrepresentation in amber (for example ants in some Cenozoic amber) cannot easily be explained by their behaviour [ 1].
9: The assessment of the ecological completeness of amber fossil assemblages requires understanding of bias in the preservation process of insects, as well as entrapment bias.
0: Here we use actualistic taphonomic experiments to determine whether decay and preservation potential of insects in amber, and therefore bias in the amber fossil record, is affected by  i. resin-type;  ii.
1: dehydration prior to entombment; and,  iii.
2: the composition of the gut microbiota.

0:  Vegetable oils are an important part of our daily diet.
1: Many diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cholestasis, obesity and other related diseases, are caused by an unbalanced diet particularly in regard to vegetable oils.
2: 1,  2
0:  The nutritional quality and the potential of oils to prevent diseases can be evaluated by five factors: atherogenic index (AI), thrombogenic index (TI), hypocholesterolemic: hypercholesterolemic ratio (HH), polyunsaturated fatty acids: saturated fatty acids (PUFA:SFA) and the  6: 3 ratio, which are calculated from the fatty acids in the oils.
1: AI, TI and H:H are used as predictor factors for cardiovascular disease.
2: 3
0:  PUFA are essential fatty acids and they can be divided into two groups; omega 3 and omega 6.
1: Based on their structures, each group has important roles in the improvement of the immune system, prevention of cancer and cardiovascular diseases.
2: 4 Commonly consumed oils, such as sunflower, corn, grape seed and rice bran oils, have high levels of  6 fatty acids and, thus, lead to increases in the ratio of  6 compared to  3 fatty acids.
3: The optimal ratio and balance of these fatty acids has an important effect on their functional properties.
4: 5 Unfortunately, there is no pure fat or oil that has a balanced amount of essential fatty acids, good oxidative stability and optimum nutritional characteristics.
5: For example, linseed oil is rich in  3 fatty acids, which are easily oxidized, while sesame and olive oils are very stable to oxidation but contain low levels of  3 fatty acids.
0:  Olive oil is one of the most stable oils under heat treatments and deep frying conditions.
1: This characteristic comes from its suitable fatty acid and triacylglycerol composition, phenolic compounds and phytosterols contents.
2: 6,  7
0:  Sesame oil, due to its high level of tocopherols, sesamolin and sesamin lignans, has good oxidation stability and also health promoting effects, such as anti-inflammatory effects and anti-proliferative activity on cancer cells.
1: 8 Moreover, sesame oil has high amount of  6 fatty acids.
2: 9Sesame and olive oils, despite all their healthy and nutritious effects, are low in  3 essential fatty acids.
3: Therefore, blending these oils with linseed oil is a good outcome to improve their functional characteristics and increase their applications in the food industry.
0:  Blending vegetable oils with different properties is a simple procedure to create new products with the desired physical, nutritional and oxidative properties and at an affordable price.
1: 10,  11
0:  Rheological measurements can give useful information about the appearance, properties, consistency and sometimes food product quality.
1: 12 Viscosity means the resistance of fluids moving from one place to another.
2: Thus, fluids with high viscosity need more force to move.
3: 13 The rheological properties of vegetable oils have new applications in the food industry and play important roles in the determination of their properties particularly when they are used in food formulation and processing.
4: 12,  14
0:  Linseed oil, because of its high content of  3 essential fatty acids and nutritional properties, has received more attention in food formulation.
1: However, linseed oil is very unstable oil and cannot be used alone in food preparations.
2: In this research, linseed oil was blended with olive and sesame oils to obtain a functional oil with high bioactive compounds, optimal essential fatty acids and suitable stability during storage.
3: The present research covers the evaluation of the chemical, nutritional and rheological properties of olive, sesame and linseed oils blends at different ratios and temperatures.

0: Tagetes minuta from sunflower (Asteraceae - Helenieae) family is a species native to South America but is now a widespread weed in most parts of the world.
1: 1 T. minuta is reported to contain a number of bioactive metabolites of high medicinal, industrial and nutritional value.
2: 2,  3 The majority of published studies of  T. minuta focused on the chemodiversity of volatile oils, flavonoids and thiophenes.
3: 4 Etheric oils are a source of bioactive and valuable molecules that are used in many fields such as aromatherapy, cosmetic, pharmaceutical, nutrition, agronomic and perfume industries.
4: 5 The essential oil compositions of  T. minuta has been studied previously in Iran and other parts of the world.
5: 6-  11 From these findings, it could be seen that the variation in Tagetes oil depends on several environmental as well as genetic factors.
6: 12,  13 In addition, according to different activities of various bioactive compounds, these differences between components of the essential oil will be important in pharmaceutical and nutritional uses.
7: 14 All these scientific facts, make a thorough evaluation necessary of the native Tagetes oil at regional level.
8: Scientific evidence suggests that vegetable oils as another important class of phytochemicals play a vital role in a healthful diet.
9: 15They provide energy and essential fatty acids (linoleic and linolenic acids), which are necessary for good health.
10: The oils are also crucial to the absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. 15 The amount of unsaturated fats is one of the most important parameter of different edible vegetable oils.
11: 16 On the other hand, the influence of common environment and genes on the fatty acid composition of plants has been demonstrated by several researchers.
12: 17,  18 Previously published investigations on  Tagetes species have demonstrated strong antioxidant properties.
13: 19,  20 Phenol and related compounds occur in food products, especially those of plant origin and are known to be responsible for the antioxidant activities.
14: These secondary metabolites are the subject of increasing scientific interest because of their importance in human health.
15: 21 In recent years, a number of researchers have reported that environmental factors (soil type, sun exposure and rainfall) can widely affect phenolic compounds of the foods.
16: 21 However, since the biosynthesis of volatile compounds are affected by geographical variation and there is no report on the composition of the essential oil of  T.minuta from North of Iran, also no study has been carried out previously on phenolic and fatty acid compounds of this plant grown in Iran, therefore this work was carried out; to identification and compare volatile constituents by GC-MS; to analyze the phenolic acids by HPLC and finally; to investigate quantification of fatty acids in the oil extracted of  Tagetes minuta by GC which may be used as initial materials for medical purposes and use in relevant industries.

0: Chamaemelum nobile (L.) All.
1: (Asteraceae), widely known as Roman chamomile, is a perennial herb native to South-Western Europe, but it is cultivated as a medicinal plant all over Europe and in Africa as well.
2: Dried flowers of the cultivated, double-flowered variety of the species are official in the European Pharmacopoeia ( European Pharmacopoeia, 2008).
3: Incorporating the plant in traditional herbal medicinal products has been acknowledged by the European Medicines Agency.
4: The comminuted herbal substance (as tea) and a liquid extract of the plant (extraction solvent: ethanol 70%  v/v) may be used for the symptomatic treatment of mild, spasmodic gastrointestinal complaints including bloating and flatulence.
5: The British Herbal Pharmacopoeia indicates its use as carminative, anti-emetic, antispasmodic, and sedative ( British Herbal Pharmacopoeia, 1971).
0: Roman chamomile (RC) has been used as a medicinal plant from the middle ages.
1: The cultivation of the plant started in England in the 16th century ( Hiller and Melzig, 1999).
2: The double variety of the flower, which now serves as the main commercial drug, has certainly been known since the 18th century ( Evans, 1989).
3: The plant gained the name nobile (Latin, noble) to illustrate its superior therapeutic efficacy over  Matricaria recutita L. (German chamomile) ( Hiller and Melzig, 1999).
4: The plant was first listed in the Pharmacopoeia of Wurttemberg (1741) as a carminative, painkiller, diuretic, and digestive aid ( Lukacs, 1990).
5: In the folk medicine of different regions of Europe, RC has been used for numerous conditions, including dyspepsia, flatulence, nausea and vomiting, anorexia, vomiting of pregnancy, dysmenorrhoea, and specifically for gastrointestinal cramps and flatulent dyspepsia associated with mental stress ( Augustin et al., 1948;  Rapoti and Romvary, 1974;  Melegari et al., 1988;  Rossi et al., 1988;  Bradley, 1992).
6: In the Mediterranean region, RC tea is consumed to improve appetite and also after meal to prevent indigestion ( Rivera and Obon, 1995;  Menendez-Baceta et al., 2014;  Alarcun et al., 2015).
7: Traditional use of RC is largely related to its supposed smooth muscle-relaxant activity.
0: The majority of the secondary metabolites described from the plant belong to the aliphatic esters (essential oil) ( Fauconnier et al., 1996), sesquiterpene lactones ( Bisset, 1994) and flavonoids ( Herisset et al., 1971,  1973;  Abou-Zied and Rizk, 1973;  Pietta et al., 1991).
1: The polysaccharide content of the dried flower is noteworthy, 3.9% ( Lukacs, 1990).
2: The supposed smooth muscle-relaxant activity of the plant might be attributed to its flavonoid content.
3: Apigenin and luteolin possess remarkable smooth muscle relaxant effects on guinea pig ileum ( Lemmens-Gruber et al., 2006).
0: Although several studies on the bioactivities of RC are available, the majority of these studies were carried out using the essential oil, which is not used medicinally, or the observed activities are not related to the traditional use of the plant.
1: Several studies demonstrate the antimicrobial effects of RC essential oil against different bacterial and fungal strains ( Hansel et al., 1993;  Piccaglia et al., 1993;  Chao et al., 2000;  Bail et al., 2009), and antifungal activity was demonstrated also for the aqueous extracts of RC ( Magro et al., 2006).
2: The anti-inflammatory capacity and heat shock protein modulating effects of the flavonoids apigenin and quercetin, as well as the anti-inflammatory activities of -bisabolol, guajazulene, and chamazulene have been reported in preclinical studies ( Viola et al., 1995;  Baghalian et al., 2008,  2011;  Hernandez-Ceruelos et al., 2010).
3: The polysaccharides of RC exerted antiphlogistic effect  in vivo ( Lukacs, 1990).
0: Although the use of RC extract for gastrointestinal problems seems to be related to its presumptive smooth muscle-relaxant effect, interestingly no  in vitro or  in vivo studies have been carried out so far to assess this bioactivity.
1: However, in an  in vitro study an aqueous extract of  C. nobile was demonstrated to induce a vasorelaxant effect through the NO-cGMP pathway or possibly through a combination of Ca 2+ channel inhibition plus NO-modulating and phosphodiesterase inhibitory mechanisms.
2: After the oral administration of RC aqueous extract, significant hypotensive effect was observed in an animal study on spontaneously hypertensive rats ( Zeggwagh et al., 2009), which may be related to the flavonoid content of the plant ( Jouad et al., 2001).
3: The clinical efficacy of orally applied preparations has not been studied yet, only the effects of external application ( Schrader et al., 1997) and aromatherapeutic use ( Wilkinson et al., 1999) have been reported.
0: The aim of the current study was to assess the effects of a hydroethanolic RC extract, its fractions and essential oil on gastrointestinal and urogenital smooth muscles, including preparations of human jejunum, in order to clarify the rationale for the use of this plant for smooth muscle relaxation.
1: Experiments were carried out with an extract conforming to the monograph of the European Medicines Agency (see in section Preparation of Herbal Extracts and Isolation of Reference Standards), and also with the fractions of this extract and with the essential oil of the plant.

1: Introduction
0: In modern society, forest plants and their products have been increasingly viewed as useful resources, which have prompted research on applications of plant-based products and utilization of associated organic compounds with diverse physiological activities [ 1].
1: Given the potential utility of plant-based products, in particular plant-based oils, it is surprising that relatively few studies have been conducted on oil resources of forest trees, which may be an important source of functional chemical substances.
2: In general, vegetable oils are obtained from grains, and their major components are fatty acids, accounting for over 90% of ester forms.
3: Vegetable fats contain more unsaturated fatty acids than animal fats, and unsaturated fatty acids have important nutritional and functional properties.
4: In particular, many seed oils contain high levels of unsaturated fatty acids.
5: Of them, the n-6 series of linoleic acid (C18 : 2) generate conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), through microbial or chemical reactions, which is an isomer known to have useful functions in the human body [ 2,  3].
6: In addition, the n-3 series of alpha-linolenic acid (C18 : 3, n-3), which are particularly representative fatty acids of perilla oil, can be converted to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20 : 5, n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22 : 6, n-3) by desaturation and chain elongation in human bodies [ 4,  5].
7: These n-3 series of fatty acids are essential to synthesize brain phospholipids and are known to improve brain function, including learning ability [ 6].
8: Vegetable fats also contain high levels of phytosterols and vitamin E, thus have antioxidant activity; these constituents confer oxidative stability for food processing, storage, and distribution [ 7,  8].
0: Among vegetable oils that are known as sources of fat-soluble components, there have been many studies on seed oils of legumes and nuts [ 9,  10], but there have been few studies on seed oils derived from tree-borne seeds [ 11].
1: Therefore, in this study, we aimed at characterizing chemical characteristics of tree-borne seed oils: mastic-leaf prickly ash (MPA, Zanthoxylum schinifolium Siebold & Zucc), Japanese camphor tree (JCT,  Cinnamomum yabunikkei H.Ohba), Korean evodia (KOE,  Euodia daniellii (Benn.)
2: Hemsl.
3: ), Japanese lacquer tree (JLT,  Rhus verniciflua Stokes), Tung tree (TUT,  Vernicia fordii (Hemsl.)
4: Airy Shaw), and oriental raisin tree (ORT,  Hovenia dulcis Thunb.).
5: Although these are plants commonly found in the wild, there has been little research on fat-soluble components of their seed oils.
6: In fact, most literature on the use of plant-based products tend to report pharmacological effects of beverage or root components using leaves or fruits of trees, whereas reports on oils tended to focus on simple topics, such as fatty acid composition.
7: As a follow-up study of our recent report about physicochemical properties of tree-borne seed oils [ 11], here we identified physicochemical properties of oils extracted from 6 trees, by which we evaluated their potentials as oil resources, and provided fundamental data for their use as oil resources.
0: Background
0: Oxidative stress in the human tissues leads to several diseases like cancer, diabetes, arthritis, atherosclerosis and chronic inflammatory disorders.
1: Nearly one-fifth of the worlds population is affected by rheumatoid arthritis [ 1].
2: The anti-arthritic and anti-inflammatory drugs presently used are characterized by their possible adverse effects on the body such as ulcers and cardiovascular problems [ 2,  3].
3: Also, the use of synthetic antioxidants like butylated hydroxyanisole and butylated hydroxytoluene in the pharmaceutical and food industries has various side effects [ 4,  5].
4: Therefore, much attention has been focused on the development of alternative anti- arthritic agents and antioxidants from natural resources.
5: It was reported that the intake of natural antioxidants has been inversely associated with morbidity and mortality from degenerative disorders and other infections [ 6].
6: Medicinal plant may offer an alternative source for the anti-arthritic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant drugs.
7: The antioxidant capacity of plant extracts was influenced by different parameters such as environmental conditions, genotype and stage of maturity [ 7 10].
0: Policosanol is a mixture of long-chain (C20 to C36) aliphatic primary alcohols exhibiting various beneficial effects on the human health.
1: It was originally isolated from sugar cane wax and is also found in a number of other natural sources such as beeswax and vegetable oils [ 11 13].
2: Policosanol may be effective in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia by inhibiting hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis, enhancing LDL catabolism and increasing high density lipoprotein levels in serum [ 14,  15].
3: These aliphatic alcohols have also been shown to possess anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects [ 13,  16].
4: Octacosanol (C28-OH), the main active policosanol, has gained attention due to its health benefits including anti-parkinsonian, antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects [ 17,  18].
5: Triacontanol (C30-OH) is able to induce anti-inflammatory responses in animals, prevent oxidative stress and inhibit lipid peroxidation [ 19,  20].
6: Millan et al.
7: [ 21] revealed that the nutraceutical combination containing policosanol, berberine, and red yeast rice induced significant improvements in plasma lipids.
8: Therefore, there is growing interest in the identification of natural sources of policosanol for the functional foods and nutraceutical applications [ 22].
9: Contents and compositions of policosanol in different plant sources such as rice bran, wheat bran, sugar cane wax, corn kernel, green tea leaves, grain sorghum, perilla seeds and grape seed have been reported [ 12,  22 25].
0: Milk thistle ( Silybum marianum L.) is an important medicinal plant from the family  Asteraceae.
1: The bioactive compounds are mainly concentrated in its seeds which have been used for more than 2000 years to treat liver diseases.
2: Milk thistle seeds contain 17.530.5% of lipids rich in unsaturated fatty acids and 13% of silymarin [ 10,  26,  27]..
3: Recently, certain  Silybum marianum accessions have begun to be cultivated in several countries and the specie is undergoing domestication for making the supply of silymarin sustainable [ 28].
4: Previously published studies examined the triacylglycerol, fatty acid, tocopherol, sterol and polyhpenol composition of milk thistle seeds [ 10,  26,  29 32].
5: Significant differences were observed between milk thistle cultivars for the content of bioactive compounds [ 10].
6: Also, the antioxidant properties of ethanolic extracts of milk thistle seeds and methanolic extracts of cold-pressed milk thistle seed oil have been reported [ 10,  31].To the best of our knowledge, however, no data has been published on the policosanol composition and the anti-arthritic activity of milk thistle oil.
7: Therefore, this study aimed to examine the policosanol profile, anti-arthritic and antioxidant activities of milk thistle oil at different stages of seed maturity.
8: Such data could serve for the evaluation of nutritional and health impact of milk thistle oil and for the development of new source of natural bioactive compounds.
0: Background
0: Natural medicines, such as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Ayurveda, were formed and developed in the daily life of ancient people and in the process of their fight against diseases over thousands of years, and they have produced a positive impact on the progress of human civilization.
1: Today, natural medicines not only provide the primary health-care needs for the majority of the population in developing countries but have attracted more and more attention in developed countries due to soaring health-care costs and universal financial austerity.
2: In the USA, approximately 49% of the population has tried natural medicines for the prevention and treatment of diseases [ 1].
3: Chemicals known to have medicinal benefits are considered to be active ingredients or active principles of natural medicines.
4: Natural products have provided the primary sources for new drug development.
5: From the 1940s to the end of 2014, nearly half of the FDA approved chemical drugs for the treatment of human diseases were derived from or inspired by natural products [ 2,  3].
6: Natural products offer more drug-like features to molecules from combinatorial chemistry in terms of functional groups, chirality, and structural complexity [ 4,  5].
0: The amounts of active ingredients in natural medicines are always fairly low.
1: The lab-intensive and time-consuming extraction and isolation process has been the bottle neck of the application of natural products in drug development.
2: There is an urgent need to develop effective and selective methods for the extraction and isolation of bioactive natural products.
3: This review intends to provide a comprehensive view of a variety of methods used in the extraction and isolation of natural products.
0: The components in the extract from above methods are complex and contain a variety of natural products that require further separation and purification to obtain the active fraction or pure natural products.
1: The separation depends on the physical or chemical difference of the individual natural product.
2: Chromatography, especially column chromatography, is the main method used to obtain pure natural products from a complex mixture.
0: A search was made with the databases PubMed, ScienceDirect and Web of Science for an update on rosemary pharmacological activities and main constituents.
1: The search was performed using the terms rosemary,  Rosmarinus officinalis, rosmarinic acid, carnosol and/or carnosic acid, published since 1990.
0: Introduction
0: Supplemental fats are often used to increase dietary energy density to meet the requirements of fast-growing broiler chickens.
1: Different fats and oils are usable in poultry nutrition: tallow, lard, palm fats and oils, vegetable oils, by-products of oil refining, and recovered frying oils [ 1].
2: Fats and oils contain fat-soluble vitamins, supply essential fatty acids, improve the palatability of feed, and reduce friction in feed mills.
3: The major component of fats and oils is fatty acids (FAs).
4: Fats and oils vary in their FA composition.
5: The metabolism of fats depends primarily on the fatty acid (FA) profile.
6: Tancharoenrat et al.
7: (2014) [ 2] showed that unsaturated FAs were well digested in the lower ileum irrespective of the source of fat.
8: The digestibility of saturated FAs (palmitic and stearic) was higher in a diet containing soybean oil (50 g/kg) than in a diet containing tallow (50 g/kg).
9: A significant proportion of synthesized and absorbed saturated FAs (SFAs) are desaturated in tissues by desaturases to monounsaturated FAs (MUFAs).
10: Fatty acid synthase produces saturated fatty acids (palmitate, stearate).
11: Fatty acids are elongated and desaturated by enzymes in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.
12: For example, the conversion of stearoyl-CoA to oleyl-CoA is catalysed by a complex of three membrane-bound proteins:  StearoylCoA+NADH+H++O2oleylCoA+NAD++2H2O A variety of unsaturated fatty acids can be formed from oleate by a combination of elongation and desaturation reactions [ 3].
13: Kouba and Mourot (1998) [ 4] showed that polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) in the diet inhibited stearoyl-9-desaturase in the liver, resulting in reduced conversion of SFAs to MUFAs.
14: Increasing the content of linoleic acid (C 18:2) in the diet and in the hepatic tissue of broiler chickens decreased the desaturation of SFAs to MUFAs [ 5].
15: The FA profile of different tissues reflects the dietary FA profile [ 6].
16: Moreover, the partitioning of absorbed FAs is different in MUFAs and PUFAs.
17: In chickens fed diets supplemented with four types of fat, MUFAs were higher in abdominal fat, whereas PUFAs were higher in muscle lipids [ 7].
18: Crespo and Esteve-Garcia (2002) [ 8] reported that broilers fed diets enriched with PUFAs deposited less abdominal and body fat than those fed SFAs or MUFAs, mainly due to the higher oxidation rate of PUFAs.
19: The metabolism of FAs in birds and mammals is different.
20: In mammals, most  de novo synthesis of FAs occurs in adipose tissue, whereas in birds, most of the fat that is deposited in adipose tissue originates from lipid synthesis in the liver [ 9].
0: Rapeseed oil, animal fat, and palm fat are commonly added to feed mixtures for poultry.
1: The public consumer is increasingly protesting against palm fat addition.
2: The reasons are both ecological, in relation to the decline of forests, and nutritional, due to the high content of saturated fatty acids in palm fat.
3: Pork lard also has a higher content of saturated fatty acids such as palm fat.
4: Therefore, the objectives of the study were to compare the effect of different sources of fat on 1) the apparent ileal digestibility of fat and FAs, 2) the FA profiles of lipids in breast muscle and abdominal fat, 3) the mRNA expression of several lipid-related hepatic genes in broiler chickens.
0: Background
0: There is a great interest in sheep farming because of the high added value of its commercial products [ 1].
1: This livestock sector has faced serious problems related to gastrointestinal infections caused mainly by the parasite  Haemonchus contortus [ 2].
2: The epidemiological importance of this nematode species is related to its wide geographical distribution and pathogenicity.
3: In addition, this parasite is a cause of significant economic losses for the sheep livestock industry around the world [ 3].
4: As a result of the inadequate management of infections, resistance against the main classes of commercially available antiparasitic agents (benzimidazoles, macrocyclic lactones and imidazothiazoles) has been developed by this species [ 4,  5], reducing their therapeutic efficacies and consequently increasing associated economic impacts [ 6].
0: A technical resource for the prevention and treatment of different veterinary diseases is the use of medicinal plants.
1: Plants have already been used for medical purposes by ancient civilizations and are currently considered a more sustainable and more easily accessible therapeutic and/or preventive alternative to synthetic drugs [ 7,  8].
2: These potential advantages have favored the search for new herbal or plant-derived agents for veterinary use, particularly those for the control of gastrointestinal parasites, including  H. contortus [ 9].
0: The choice of the plant species for pharmacological studies is important and should be based on solid operational strategies and relevant ethnopharmacological/chemotaxonomic data [ 10].
1: Within this context,  Citrus aurantifolia, Anthemis nobile and  Lavandula officinalis were traditionally used in folk medicine as anthelmintics against different etiological agents.
2: They are widely distributed in Brazil, and are relatively good producers of essential oils.
3: The oils extracted from the plants are a rich mixture of terpenes and terpenoids [ 11].
4: Many of these compounds have already proven their anthelmintic activities against different parasites, including  H. contortus.
5: Furthermore, the botanical families and genera to which  C. aurantifolia (family Rutaceae; genus  Citrus),  A. nobile (family Asteraceae; genus  Anthemis) and  L. officinalis (family Lamiaceae; genus  Lavandula) belong are traditionally known for their anthelmintic activity against  H. contortus [ 12 15].
0: Despite the great potential of  C. aurantifolia,  A. nobile and  L. officinalis as anthelmintics, there are no data on the potential activities of the essential oils of these plants against  H. contortus.
1: Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the in vitro anthelmintic activity of essential oils obtained from the fruit peel of  C. aurantifolia (Christm.)
2: Swingle (Rutaceae); flowers of  A. nobile (syn.
3: Chamaemelum nobilis (L.) All.)
4: (Asteraceae); and flowers of  L. officinalis (Chaix & Kitt.)
5: (Lamiaceae), against different developmental stages of the parasite  H. contortus.
0: Introduction
0: Linolenic acid (18:3) plays important roles in plant metabolism as a structural component of storage and membrane lipids, and as a precursor of signaling molecules involved in plant development and stress response [ 1, 2].
1: For human, alpha-linoenic acid (18:3 -3) is one of essential fatty acids, which are necessary for health and must be acquired from diet [ 3].
2: Moreover, 18:3 is a metabolic precursor for long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) synthesis [ 4], such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5 5,8,11,14,17, -3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6 4,7,10,13,16,19, -3).
3: They are essential constituents of human nutrition, and play key roles in brian and cardiovascular health [ 5 8].
4: However, the primary source of EPA and DHA is the marine product, especially fish oil [ 9].
0: In higher plants, fatty acids are synthesized  de novo in the stroma of plastids through a complex series of condensation reactions to produce either C16 or C18 fatty acids.
1: These fatty acids are then incorporated into the two glycerolipid synthetic pathways: the prokaryotic pathway and eukaryotic pathway [ 10, 11].
2: Chloroplast galactolipids contain substantial amounts of trienoic fatty acid, either the hexatrienoic acid (16:3) or 18:3, which may vary in different plant species [ 12].
3: In both glycerol pathways, desaturation of fatty acids is performed by a series of membrane-bound desaturases of the chloroplast and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [ 2, 11].
0: Fatty acid desaturases are encoded by nuclear genes and differ in the substrate specificity and subcellular localization, and play critical roles in maintaining proper structure and cellular function of biological membranes [ 2, 13, 14].
1: Stearoyl ACP desaturase (SAD) is the only soluble desaturase, which convertes stearoyl-ACP (18:0-ACP) to oleic acid (18:1-ACP) by introducing the first double bond at the 9 th position from the carboxylic end of the fatty acyl chain in the process of fatty acid synthesis [ 14, 15].
2: Furhter desaturations are carried out by membrane-bound desaturases in the ER (FAD2 and FAD3) and the chloroplast (FAD4, FAD5, FAD6, FAD7, and FAD8) as we mentioned before.
3: FAD2 and FAD6 are -6 desaturases that synthesize linolenic acid (18:2) from oleic acid (18:1) by introduction of a double bond at the 12 th position from carboxylic end or 6 th position from the  end in the ER and plastid, respectively.
4: While, FAD3, FAD7, and FAD8 are -3 desaturases that desaturase 18:2 to 18:3 by inserting a double bond at the 15 th position from the carboxylic end or 3 rd position from the  end.
5: Moreover, the  FAD8 gene encodes a plastidial -3 desaturase that is cold-inducible, which can compensate the decreased expression of  FAD7 under the low temperature [ 16, 17].
6: FAD4 and FAD5 synthesize 16:1 from 16:0 specifically for the main component of chloroplast membrane phosphatidylglycerol and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, respectively [ 15].
0: The genes encoding -3 fatty acid desaturases have been identified and studied from several plant species, such as Arabidopsis [ 16, 18, 19], soybean [ 11, 13, 20],  Zea mays [ 21], olive [ 1, 22], safflower ( Carthamus tinctorius L.) [ 23],  Jatropha curcas [ 24], and flax [ 25].
1: Microsomal FAD3 enzymes have been shown to be the major contributors to seed 18:3 content in Arabidopsis, soybean, and flax [ 14, 18, 20, 25].
2: On the contrary, the overexpression of a chloroplast -3 fatty acid desaturase was demonstrated to enhance the tolerance to low temperatures [ 26, 27].
3: Furthermore, overexpression of -3 fatty acid desaturases  BnFAD3 from  Brassica napus and  StFAD7 from  Solanum tuberosum in tomato enhanced resistance to cold stress, and altered fatty acid composition with an increase in the 18:3/18:2 ratio in leaves and fruits [ 28].
4: Increased desaturation of glycerolipids severs as compensation to cold-caused decrease in membrane fluidity [ 29, 30].
5: Thus, plant desaturases are very sensitive to several environmental cues such as temperature, light, or other factors [ 11, 31].
0: Oil palm ( Elaeis guineensis Jacq.)
1: is the most productive oil-bearing crop in the world [ 32].
2: It is native to West Africa, but is now grown thuoughout the humid tropical lowlands [ 33, 34].
3: There are two major economic productions from oil palm fruits: palm oil extracted from the mesocarp and palm kernel oil from the endosperm [ 35, 36].
4: Palm oil contains oleate (18:1; 45%), linoleate (18:2; 8%), and 47% saturated fatty acid (43% of 16:0 and 4% of 18:0).
5: Therefore, much effort has been made to understand the oil synthesis in oil palm fruits and improve the fatty acid composition of palm oil since the high content of saturated fatty acid has been thought to be unhealthy to human [ 37].
6: The activity of a 12 fatty acid desaturase from oil palm has been tested in yeast, and it produced about 12% of linoleic acid in yeast, which barely exist in wild-type yeast cells [ 38].
7: Recently, the  in vivo function of a  DGAT2 gene from oil palm mesocarp has been verified in yeast and transgenic Arabidopsis, exhibiting a substrate preference towards unsaturated fatty acids [ 39].
0: In the present work, a chloroplast -3 fatty acid desaturase ( EgFAD8) and its promoter from oil palm has been isolated and characterized.
1: The expression pattern of  EgFAD8 in leaves and mesocarp at five developmental stages has been detected by Real-time quantitative PCR.
2: The  in vivo function of EgFAD8 has been verified by overexpression in  Saccharomyces cerevisiae (INVSc1) with exogenous linoleic acid (18:2).
3: To detect whether it could be induced by low temperature or the change of environment, we detected the efficiency of the  EgFAD8 promoter in transgenic Arabidopsis treated with low temperature and darkness, respectively.
4: These results revealed the function of  EgFAD8 and the feature of its promoter from high plants, which will be useful for understanding the role of -3 fatty acid desaturases from fruits grown in the tropical areas.
0: Introduction
0: In the work carried out by Nowotarska et al.
1: [ 10] the antimicrobial modes of action of six compounds from cinnamon and oregano EOs against  Mycobacteriun avium sbsp.
2: paratuberculosis were evaluated.
3: It is a pathogenic bacterium that can infect food animals and humans and to be present in milk, cheese, and meat which reveals the interest in studying some compounds to be inhibited and their action mechanisms.
0: Others two papers are related to the effect of thyme and savory EOs on specific foods: Santoro et al.
1: [ 11] reported the effect on the control of postharvest diseases and quality of peaches and nectarines, while Banani et al.
2: [ 12] reported its efficacy on apples.
3: In the first work the authors concluded that both EOs favor a reduction of brown rot incidence (caused by  Monilinia fructicola) but increased gray mold (caused by  Botrytis cinerea).
4: Respect to the overall quality of the fruits, both EOs showed a positive effect in reducing weight loos and in maintaining ascorbic acid and carotenoid content.
5: Regarding the second study, apples treated with these EOs showed lower gray mold severity and incidence and the authors reported that the PR-8 gene of apple may play a key role in the mechanism implicated in this inhibition.
0: The prevention of growth of  Escherichia coli in ground beef by the application of surfactant micelle-entrapped eugenol was the objective proposed in the paper by Tolen et al.
1: [ 13].
2: In this case the authors concluded that this antimicrobial treatment did not significantly decontaminate ground beef and so further studies must be proposed to increase the utility of these EOs for beef safety protection.
0: Application of essential oils in food systems is an interesting and growing area for researchers whose results could end up having a great use for food industries.
1: It is a wide field of research where different aspects can be addressed.
2: We hope that readers will find this issue interesting and useful and allow them to understand its importance and relevance and so to propose new studies for future papers.
0: The application of essential oils (EOs) in food systems as natural inhibitors or biopreservatives has received increasing attention mainly due to consumer concerns toward chemical preservatives.
1: This increasing interest can be checked by the number of papers published related to EOs application in foods.
2: In a basic search using the Web of Science database, from 1950 to 2017, selecting as search topic essential oils and foods and as document type article a total of 5559 results were obtained.
3: Although the first article found dates from 1953 [ 1] and since then a trickle of articles appear in the following years, it is not until 1990 that articles published every year are reported.
4: Figure 1 shows the evolution of the number of papers per year (from 1990 to 2017) published regarding essential oils and foods.
5: As can be seen in this figure, more than 86% of these papers have been published in last decade which reveals the currently of the topic addressed in this special issue.
0: The application of essential oils for shelf-life extension in foods is mainly due to their antioxidant and antimicrobial properties which also is reflected in the number of papers found when the words antioxidant (1920 papers), antimicrobial (2473 papers), or both (973 papers) were added as searching criterion.
1: Regarding the type of foods mainly used in these studies, it can be concluded that essential oils have been applied as biopreservatives in all types of foods, although their application in fruits and vegetables has been the highest reported: fruits (657 papers), vegetables (403 papers), fish products (415 papers), meat products (410 papers), milk and dairy products (216 papers), and bread and baked foods (97 papers).
0: One of the most important aspects that has changed along time is the way in which essential oil has been applied in foods.
1: The first method of application was directly added essential oil to the food matrix, which showed special limitations mainly associated with intrinsic obstacles such as their low water solubility, high volatility, low stability, bioavailability, and strong odor.
2: EOs are unstable volatile compounds which can be degraded easily (by oxidation, volatilization, heating, light, etc.)
3: when they are added to the food matrix.
4: It must be taken into account that most of the food elaboration processes include heat treatment or air and light exposition, all of them factors that increase their degradation.
5: For these reasons, several protection methods to increase their action duration and to provide a controlled release during the shelf-life of food have been proposed.
6: Encapsulation has emerged as a useful alternative to enhance EO stability.
7: The encapsulation of EOs using different materials and methods has been widely studied [ 2].
8: EOs have been encapsulated in polymeric particles, liposomes, and solid lipid nanoparticles, which enhanced its stability and efficacy.
9: The recent advances in nanotechnology have made possible the development of novel carrier agents for the delivery and control release of EOs in food system with enhanced chemical, oxidative, and thermal stability [ 3].
10: Although nanoencapsulation is a promising tool for effective delivery of EOs into food, the toxicological aspects of most of the nanocarriers and their molecular target site must be further explored.
0: EOs have also been used as additives in biodegrabable films and coatings for active food packaging [ 4, 5].
1: EOs can provide the films and coatings with antioxidant and/or antimicrobial properties, depending both on their composition and on the interactions with the polymer matrix.
2: The antioxidant activity depends not only on the specific antioxidant activity of the oil compounds but also on the films oxygen permeability.
3: The incorporation into edible films can promote the antimicrobial capacity of EOs, and the effectiveness of the edible film against microbial growth will depend on the oils nature and the type of microorganism.
4: EOs controlled release from edible films is another aspect that positively affects their effectiveness.
5: In addition, consumers concern regarding possible negative health effects of applying synthetic preservatives to food products together with the boom of organic culture that promotes the consumption of organic foods (in whose processing synthetic additives are not authorized) have also contribute to boost the interest in organic EOs properties.
0: In this special issue, the original papers published address all these aspects providing further insights into the application of EOs in foods or assessing specific properties relevant in a specific type of EO.
0: In the study by Pellegrini et al.
1: [ 6] the authors focused their interest in EOs from some officinal plants from the Abruzzo territory (Italy), assessing the whole chemical characterization of their volatile fraction and their antimicrobial and antioxidant activities.
2: All these analyses allow establishing which of them could be better candidates for their potential application as biopreservatives depending on the type of food to be incorporated.
3: In addition, the characterization of EOs autochthonous from a specific region will allow their application by local industries contributing to their development.
0: The study by Sharopov et al.
1: [ 7] also contributes to increasing the knowledge of local EOs, in this case it is regarding the EO of Fennel from Tajikistan.
2: These authors assessed the chemical composition of this EO by gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analysis and its antioxidant activity.
3: In addition, these authors also studied the potential cytotoxic activity against several cancer cell lines, which is very important for its potential application in food products.
0: Consistent with this aspect there is also the paper of Satyal et al.
1: [ 8] contributing to a deeper knowledge about EOs from a culinary ingredient broadly used around the world (garlic).
2: In this case, EOs from both, garlic ( Allium sativum) and other type of garlic widely used as its substitute ( Allium vineale), have been chemically characterized.
0: Ballester-Costa et al.
1: [ 9] have focused their study in EOs from four Thymus species from organic growth, contributing to their potential application to organic food processing.
2: Taking into account that thymus is a common specie in the Spain meat industry, the work has assessed its antioxidant and antibacterial properties with the objective of its use for the meat industry.
3: The main novelty of this work is the application, as culture medium for the antibacterial activity evaluation, and of several meat homogenates (minced beef, cooked ham, or dry-cured sausage).
4: This type of study allows that the potential effect of these meat matrices on bacterial survival would be included in the general antibacterial activity that has been evaluated.

1: Introduction
0: Terminalia is the second-largest genus of the combretaceae family, with approximately 250 species growing in tropical and subtropical countries around the world [ 1].
1: More than 30 species of  Terminalia occur in northern regions of Australia [ 2].
2: More than 50 species of  Terminalia have found utility as ingredients in foods and beverages worldwide, as preservatives, raw material for wine and palm sugar, eaten raw and as food supplements [ 3].
3: The nutritional and therapeutic properties of  Terminalia genus can be attributed to the presence of a wide range of phytochemicals, such as phenolic compounds, which encompasses phenolic acids, gallotannins, ellagitannins, proanthocyanidins and other flavonoids [ 3].
0: Terminalia ferdinandiana, popularly known as Kakadu plum, is native to Australia.
1: Indigenous Australians (Aboriginal people) have been using this plant as a food and medicine for centuries, for example, refreshing drinks are made from fresh or dried fruits in Western Australia [ 2].
2: Fruits are traditionally used as an antiseptic, soothing balm, in colds and flu and in treating a headache [ 4].
3: A number of research outcomes have been reported on the antioxidant [ 5, 6, 7], antibacterial [ 8, 9], anti-inflammatory [ 10], anti-apoptotic, cytoprotective and anticancer activities [ 11] of  T. ferdinandiana fruits and leaves.
4: Phytochemical analysis has revealed that  T. ferdinandiana fruit is a rich source of Ellagic acid and its hydrolysable tannins, ellagitannins [ 12].
5: Recently, a food safe extraction method of  T. ferdinandiana fruits for commercial use in the food industry has been suggested [ 4].
6: Additionally, a systematic evaluation of the changes in quality and bioactivity of the fruits of  T. ferdinandiana during processing, packaging and storage has been performed, and key chemical markers have been identified to enable standardized products to be delivered to the consumer [ 9].
0: In the last two decades, seeds and kernels from the  Terminalia genus have been researched and reported for their nutritional properties and health-promoting activities [ 13, 14, 15].
1: To understand the relationship between the internal quality and genotype of the plant, studies of nut and kernels characteristics and composition are very common.
2: During the industrial processing of  T. ferdinandiana fruits, the seeds are treated as waste products and have been discarded.
3: Recent studies on many fruit seeds or kernels have shown that they have the potential to be utilized as ingredients for value addition, they are very nutritious and could be used as alternate sources of essential minerals, fatty acids, and proteins [ 16, 17, 18, 19].
0: To date, no reports have been published on the utilization of the by-products of  T. ferdinandiana and there is no investigation on the chemical and nutritional composition of  T. ferdinandiana kernels.
1: The aim of this study was to determine the potential use of the by-product of  T. ferdinandiana in the industry by determining proximate, mineral and fatty acid compositions to ascertain its nutritional value and potential as a source of food supplement ingredients for the food industry.
0: INTRODUCTION
0: For many years, aromatic plants, such as myrtle, have been widely used for their medicinal properties ( 1).
1: Different parts of myrtle such as leaves, berries, branches, and fruits have been widely applied in the traditional medicine ( 2).
2: Moreover, not only have myrtle leaves been utilized for treatment of diarrhea, stomachache, hyperglycemia, cough, and pulmonary disorders but they have also been externally used as an antiseptic, disinfectant, and for mouth ulcer, burn, and wound healing ( 13).
3: Such therapeutic potentials may be related to myrtle's major secondary metabolites including polyphenols and essential oils (EOs) ( 4).
0: EOs are natural multi-component systems composed mainly of both terpenes and some other non-terpene components ( 5).
1: Low chemical and physical stability of the EOs as well as their lipophilic nature have been considered as the important obstacle to the preparation and storage of the EOs formulations.
0: In terms of physical properties, EOs are volatile compounds which can easily evaporate and/or decompose even at room temperature due to very low boiling point and direct exposure to light or oxygen, respectively ( 6).
1: Furthermore, conventional formulations of EOs can oftentimes cause skin irritation and sensitization.
2: Several approaches including the application of vesicular systems such as niosomes ( 7) have been developed to resolve these problems.
3: Niosomes are non-ionic surfactants and have been used in drug ( 8) or gene delivery ( 9).
4: In drug delivery, niosomes are capable of increasing skin penetration and acting as a local depot to provide sustained release of topically applied drugs in the dermis.
5: Due to properties such as biodegradability, non-toxicity, non-immunogenicity, low cost, and superior chemical and storage stabilities, niosomes offer several advantages over other vesicular systems ( 1011).
6: EOs entrapment in the hydrophobic region of niosomes can improve their permeability and stability features, consequently reducing skin irritation properties of EOs ( 12).
7: Niosomal formulations can improve the stratum corneum functions by attenuating water loss from trans-epidermal skin and increasing skin smoothness by replacing its lost lipids.
8: Furthermore, the residence time of drug in the stratum corneum and epidermis increases and its systemic absorption decreases following application of niosomal systems ( 1314).
9: It was previously shown by Manosroi,  et al.
10: that niosomal encapsulation of  Mimusops elengi flower extract reduced extract cytotoxicity on human skin fibroblast and also enhanced its physical stability ( 15).
0: In the current study, at first myrtle essential oil (MEO) was extracted and analyzed and then the niosomal myrtle essential oil (nMEO) were prepared and characterized in for their size, zeta potential, percentage of entrapment efficiency (EE%), and stability.
1: Finally, functionality of nMEO for microbial growth inhibition was measured against  Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Serratia marcescens, and  Bacillus subtilis.
2: These bacterial species are responsible for wound contamination, wound colonization, and clinical infections.
3: Also they may cause opportunistic skin infections in immune-suppressed patients.
4: Gram-positive coccid such as  S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and  M. luteus may origin from wound infections, impetigo, furuncles, abscesses, and carbuncles.
5: The Gram-negative bacilli including  E. coli and  S. marcescens are part of normal intestinal flora.
6: However, in some situation they may cause infection in complicating burn injuries and also surgical site ( 1617).
7: In this study, we hypothesized that nMEO is more efficient than MEO in drug releasing behavior.

1: Introduction
0: Palm oil is characterized by chemical/physical properties, low cost and wide availability and for these reasons is largely used in the food industry r [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
1: However, there has been an intense debate about whether it is a potential danger to human health [ 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16].
2: In 2016, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) produced a document on the risks related to the consumption of refined vegetable oils.
3: In particular, the Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) warned of the presence of substances formed during the production process, particularly when vegetable oils are refined at high temperatures (approximately 200 C); the oils undergo partial hydrolysis of triglycerides with glycerol oxidation, leading to the formation of 3-monochloropropanediol (3-MCPD) and 2-mono-chloropropanediol (2-MCPD) [ 1].
4: The highest levels of these compounds were observed in palm oil, but the majority of refined vegetable oils contain considerably large quantities.
5: Interestingly, while refined palm oil might contain high amounts of MCPD, raw palm oil might be considered healthy.
0: In 2012, the Codex Alimentarius recommended the use of technological adjustments to reduce the levels of 3-MCPD in the finished product.
1: In 2013, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) stated that there was no evidence to suggest that 3-MCPD is not genotoxic, and the same agency had already classified glycidol in the 2a group (i.e., probably carcinogenic to humans) in 2000 [ 2].
2: In a careful review of the scientific literature, we focused on nutritional characteristics and health effects of the use of palm oil with regards to children, seeking to determine whether there is evidence that justifies fears about the health effects of palm oil.
0: This article provides an overview of papers regarding palm oil and child health in the past 20 years.
1: A PubMed search indexed for MEDLINE and EMBASE was undertaken to identify studies in children and adults using the terms palm oil, palmitic acid, saturated fatty acid, health, children, cardiovascular diseases, cholesterol, postprandial lipemia, diabetes, inflammation, cancer, overweight and obesity as key words.
2: Only English-language articles were reviewed.
3: The references of the selected articles were consulted for additional contributions that might be relevant.
4: The date of our last search was August 2017, and the period covered was approximately 20 years.
0: Background
0: In recent years, foremost issues that have been interesting to all the world countries are food safety, food security and nutrition [ 1].
1: The essential requirement, probably the most important one, of individuals is nutrition to live healthy and strong in terms of physically, mentally and emotionally, to improve themselves economically and socially, for prospering and to continue themselves existence as happy, peaceful and secure [ 2].
2: It is asserted that an adult person should take 1 g of protein per kg of body weight per day in order to keep healthy and balanced diet and 4250% of this amount should consist of animal originated proteins [ 3].
3: Chicken meat is one of the most important resources of animal protein that should be consumed for physical and mental development, healthy and balanced diet.
4: It is an important and strategic nutrient resource since it has low cholesterol and fat ratio compared to red meat and it has healthful properties like easy digestion and being a good source of protein in terms of nutritional value as well as having low cost compared to other protein sources [ 4].
5: However, too many animals in poultry-house during broiler breeding causes animals to be more vulnerable and less resistant and thus more susceptible to sudden state changes.
6: Antibiotics, added into rations as feed additive in order to reduce the risk of diseases and achieve rapid live weight gain, played a crucial role until the last few years [ 5].
7: However, long-term use of these antibiotics results in the development of resistant strains against antibiotics, thus use of many antibiotics has been prohibited in the many parts of world, especially in the European Union countries since 2006 [ 6].
8: Therefore, researchers are in search of a natural and safe growth stimulant that can be an alternative product to maintain developments provided by the use of antibiotics as a growth factor and to overcome the shortcomings that may arise in the absence of antibiotics [ 7].
9: For this purpose, the aromatic plants, etheric oils obtained from these plants and their bioactive secondary metabolites are used in medicine, cosmetics and food fields due to their various properties including antibacterial, antioxidant, antiviral, antifungal and digestive stimulatory effect.
10: They are gaining currency to be used as an animal nutrition as well [ 5].
11: In plant tissues, high molecular compounds like carbohydrate, lipid, protein, cellulose, lignin and pectin are quite abundant and these substances, called primary (main) metabolites, are necessary for physiological development of plants due to their primary role in cell metabolism [ 8].
12: On the other hand, secondary metabolites are produced from primary metabolites via biosynthesis and generally have role in pollination, complying with environmental conditions, chemical defense against microorganisms, insects and other predators and competition with other plants.
13: They are small molecules, whose quantities are sometimes too low to be measured such as alkaloids, volatile oils, glycosides, steroids, flavonoids, tannins, phenols, coloring agent and resins [ 9,  10].
14: The bioactive substances synthesized in medicinal and aromatic plants increase or decrease depending on the part of plant which is used as a drug, the physiological period of plant and the time when plant drug are gathered.
15: This change results in difficulty in finding the effective dosage that makes harder use of plant itself or its essential oils directly as feed additive.
16: Therefore, it is preferred to use active substances in the composition of the essential oil isolated from aromatic plants as feed additives [ 11].
17: In the experiment, as proportion of carvacrol found in thyme ( Origanum vulgare) essential oil, cinnamaldehyde found in cinnamon ( Cinnamomum zeylanicum) essential oils, capsaicin bioactive substances found in chili paprika ( Capsicum annuum) can vary in etheric oils due to reasons mentioned above, synthetic 99% carvactol, 98% cinnamaldehyde, 99% capsicum oleoresin (includes 6.6% capsaicin), which are identical to natural secondary metabolites were used.
18: Because carvacrol and cinnamaldehyde are both digestive stimulants and can increase appetite as well as being antifunfgal [ 11,  12], while capsicum oleoresin is endocrine and immune stimulant [ 13,  14], and also antioxidant [ 15], lastly the mixture group can act synergistically with various combination of active substances, they were preferred [ 16].
19: On the other hand, in studies conducted with different plant extracts and etheric oils, it was found that sensory (tenderness, taste) and physical (toughness, firmness) properties of broiler meat were not affected in general [ 17], and some of the chemical properties (decreased MDA, increased PUFA) were improved [ 18].
20: Indeed, The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of main active ingredients and homogeneous mixtures of carvacrol found in the essential oil of thyme ( Origanum vulgare), cinnamaldehyde found in the essential oil of cinnamon ( Cinnamomum zeylanicum) and capsicum oleoresin found in the extracts of hot red pepper ( Capsicum annuum) on mixed feed at a rate of 150 mg / kg on the sensory, physical and chemical properties of broilers breast meat (including pectoralis major and pectoralis minor) and leg meat (including thigh and drumstick).

1: Introduction
0: Liver fibrosis and cirrhosis are the ultimate consequences of chronic hepatic injury induced by various etiological agents [ 1].
1: The mechanism of liver fibrosis has been extensively studied.
2: However, effective antifibrotic therapies are lacking [ 2].
3: The pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis is generally based on the activation of HSCs and excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) production [ 2].
4: Oxidative stress plays a central role in triggering these inflammatory and fibrotic responses [ 3].
5: Among the various signaling pathways involved in pathogenesis of liver fibrosis, TGF- 1/SMAD is considered the most significant signaling pathway [ 4].
6: Therefore, inhibiting TGF- 1 was found to be efficient in attenuating liver fibrosis [ 5,  6].
7: The tumor suppressor p53 is another important cell signal primarily stimulated in response to oxidative damage and oncogene activation [ 7].
8: Accumulating evidences suggested the involvement of p53 in the pathophysiology of various nontumoral fibrotic liver diseases in both human and animals [ 8,  9].
9: These data suggest that p53 regulation could serve as an important therapeutic target for fibrotic liver diseases.
0: Medicinal plants and their derivatives contain a wide variety of bioactive phytochemicals with a diverse pharmacological spectrum [ 10,  11].
1: Essential oils constituents including terpenes, terpenoids, phenylpropenes, and other degradation products have been reported to exhibit strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities [ 12].
2: The effectiveness of some essential oils to alleviate the hepatotoxicity [ 13] and hepatic fibrosis [ 14] has been proven.
3: Mentha piperita L. (peppermint) is one of the most popular and widely used herbs.
4: Pharmacological investigations have demonstrated that  M. piperita possesses analgesic, antifungal [ 15], antibacterial [ 16], antiparasitic, and immunomodulatory activities [ 17].
5: Moreover, the hepatoprotective effects of  M. piperita leaves extract [ 18], oil [ 19,  20], or its active components menthol and menthone [ 21] have been reported.
6: However, to the best of our knowledge, the effect against hepatic fibrosis has not been reported.
7: Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of  Mentha piperita L. essential oil (MPEO) against hepatic fibrosis and to elucidate the potential underlying molecular mechanisms.

1: Introduction
0: Complementary and alternative medicines are used by 6080% of developing countries because they are one of the most prevalent sources of medicine worldwide [ 1 4].
1: Essential oils are also one of the most popular natural products, with one of their main applications being their use in dermatology [ 5 7].
2: An overview of the research articles about effectiveness of essential oils in topical application states its use for the treatment of infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses in the most cases [ 8].
3: Natural topical preparations containing thyme essential oil could be a valuable alternative to antifungal and antibacterial drugs.
0: Thymus vulgaris L. (Lamiaceae) is an aromatic and medicinal plant containing essential oil and is widely used all over the world for its expectorant, antibroncholitic, antispasmodic, and other properties.
1: Antimicrobial properties of plant essential oils were revealed a long time ago, but researches are expanded and complements acknowledged findings.
2: Recent articles present the beneficial properties in nature as biofungicide: thyme essential oil is active against  Mycosphaerella graminicolathe pathogen today causes one of the most important diseases of wheat [ 9].
3: Activity against microorganisms is widely published: against  Staphylococcus aureus,  Pseudomonas aeruginosa,  Salmonella typhimurium,  Escherichia coli,  Klebsiella pneumoniae,  Enterococcus faecalis, and  Candida albicans [ 10];  Staphylococcus epidermidis,  Streptococcus sp., and  Pantoea sp.
4: [ 11]; and  Bacillus spp.
5: , Shigella spp.
6: , Trichophyton spp.
7: (nail and scalp isolated),  Microsporum spp.
8: , Aspergillus niger, and  Rhodotorula rubra [ 12].
9: The essential oils are natural, nontoxic, nonpollutive, and biodegradable compounds with broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, low risk of side effects after their use, and low risk of resistance development by microorganisms [ 13].
10: In this investigation, the main goal was focused on activity against  Candida albicans.
11: Yeasts may act as opportunistic pathogens and can cause candidiasis at several different anatomical sites [ 14].
12: Essential oils demonstrating noteworthy activity against this organism are quite extensively investigated and most oils used in dermatology have been tested against this pathogen [ 8].
0: A typical essential oil may contain 20 to 80 phytochemicals [ 15].
1: Thyme has numerous chemotypes named according to the major compound, for example, thymol, carvacrol, terpineol, and linalool.
2: Thyme essential oil consisted primarily of thymol (38.1%), p-cymene (29.1%), g-terpinene (5.2%), linalool (3.7%), and carvacrol (2.3%) [ 16].
3: It has been demonstrated that the biological effects of  Thymus vulgaris are mainly due to the presence of phenolic compounds, especially thymol and carvacrol [ 17].
4: Thymol content in thyme essential oil is much higher than carvacrol content.
5: This compound shows 30 times higher antiseptic effects and four times lower toxicity than phenol [ 18,  19].
0: Thyme essential oil is a clear yellow or very dark reddish-brown liquid with a pungent smell of thyme easily mixed with liquid paraffin and vegetable oils.
1: In view of these properties, the form of oleogel was formulated.
2: The majority of oleogel applications reported in the pharmaceutical area were related to transdermal systems, topical bases, and preparations intended for percutaneous absorption [ 20].
3: Lipophilic gels are popular in the pharmaceutical industry for simple production technology, long-term stability, and new wide range of gelators.
4: In comparison with emulsions, oleogels have better viscosity and spreadability; the high lipid content of the products causes an optimal reduction of any skin roughness, beneficial for skin protection purposes [ 21].
0: Anhydrous colloidal silica is suitable for the formulation of oleogel with desired texture and chemical and physical stability.
1: The clear gel is formed when the material is characterized by a similar refractory index as Aerosil (1.48).
2: Incorporation of the silica into oil leads to an increase in viscosity, which is brought about by hydrogen bonding between the silica particles: 510 percent silica imparts a paste-like consistency on a range of oils [ 21].
3: Liquid paraffin and olive oil were chosen for the oleogel formulation with the goal of evaluating the influence of the oil origin on the texture and stability.
4: The composition of oleogel was optimized with response surface central composite design in order to get desirable textural properties.
0: Introduction
0: To create degradable nanofibers, a reactive electrospinning technique is described in which a double barrel syringe equipped with a static mixer at its outlet (as used for making bulk hydrogels) is attached to a standard electrospinning platform ( Figure 4) 33.
0: Figure 4: Schematic of hydrogel nanofiber formation via reactive electrospinning.
1: A double barrel syringe with a static mixer (loaded as described for bulk hydrogels but also including a fraction of high molecular weight poly(ethylene oxide) as an electrospinning aid) is mounted on a syringe pump, with the needle at the end of the syringe connected to a high voltage power supply.
2: Hydrazone crosslinking occurs during the fiber spinning process so that when the stream hits the collector (either aluminum foil or a rotating aluminum disk) the nanofibrous morphology is maintained.
3: Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.
0: The application of such methods for creating degradable smart hydrogel networks is demonstrated in this protocol using either PNIPAM or POEGMA as the polymer of interest; however, the basic approaches described can be translated to any water-soluble polymer, albeit with suitable adjustments for viscosity and (in the case of the self-assembly nanogel fabrication method) the stability of the pre-polymer in forming the seed nanoaggregate.
0: Smart materials have attracted significant attention due to their potential for reversible "on-demand" responses to external and/or environmental signals.
1: Temperature-responsive materials have attracted particular interest due to their lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior, resulting in temperature-driven precipitation at temperatures T>LCST 12.
2: In the context of thermoresponsive hydrogels, this lower critical solution temperature behavior is manifested by reversible swelling/de-swelling events that result in temperature-tunable bulk sizes (larger at T<LCST) 3, pore sizes (larger at T<LCST) 4, and interfacial properties (more hydrophilic at T<LCST) 5.
3: Such transitions have been widely applied in drug delivery (for external or environmentally-triggerable drug release 467), tissue engineering and cell culture (for thermoreversible cell adhesion/delamination 8910), separations (for switchable membrane porosities and permeabilities or thermally-recyclable diagnostic supports 111213), microfluidic processes (for on-off valves regulating flow 1415), and rheological modifiers (for temperature-tunable viscosities 16).
4: The most commonly investigated thermoresponsive hydrogels are based on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) 17, although significant (and increasing) work has also been conducted on poly(oligoethylene glycol methacrylate) (POEGMA) 218 and poly(vinylcaprolactam) (PVCL) 1920.
5: POEGMA has attracted particular recent interest given its anticipated improved biocompatibility 2122and its facile-to-tune LCST behavior, in which linearly-predictable mixtures of monomers with different numbers of ethylene oxide repeat units in their side chains can alter the LCST from ~20 C to >90 C 223.
6: However, each of these polymers is prepared by free radical polymerization and thus contains a carbon-carbon backbone, significantly limiting the potential utility and translatability of such polymers in the context of biomedical applications in which degradation (or at least the capacity for clearance through renal filtration) is typically a requirement.
0: In response to this limitation, we have recently reported extensively on the application of hydrazone chemistry ( i.e., the reaction between hydrazide and aldehyde-functionalized pre-polymers) to prepare degradable analogues of thermoresponsive hydrogels 242526272829.
1: The rapid and reversible reaction between hydrazide and aldehyde groups upon mixing of the functionalized precursor polymers 30 enables both  in situ gelation (enabling facile injection of these materials without the need for surgical implantation or any type of external polymerization stimulus such as UV irradiation or chemical initiation) as well as hydrolytic degradation of the network at a rate controlled by the chemistry and density of the crosslinking sites.
2: Furthermore, by maintaining the molecular weight of the pre-polymers used to prepare the hydrogels below the renal filtration limit, hydrogels made using this approach degrade back into the oligomeric precursor polymers that can be cleared from the body 252728.
3: Coupled with the low cytotoxicity and low inflammatory tissue response induced by these materials 252627, this approach offers a potentially translatable method for the use of thermoresponsive smart hydrogels in medicine, particularly if well-controlled degradable analogues of such hydrogels on all length scales (bulk, micro, and nano) can be fabricated.
0: In this protocol, we describe methods for making synthetic thermoresponsive pre-polymers functionalized with controlled numbers of hydrazide and aldehyde groups as well as methods to apply these polymers to create hydrogels with well-defined dimensions on various length scales.
1: In particular, this manuscript describes four distinct approaches we have developed to control the mixing of the reactive hydrazide and aldehyde-functionalized pre-polymers and thus create thermoresponsive hydrogel networks with well-defined geometries and morphologies:
0: To create degradable bulk hydrogels with defined sizes, a templating strategy is described by which the reactive pre-polymers are loaded into separate barrels of a double-barrel syringe equipped at its outlet with a static mixer and subsequently co-extruded into a silicone mold with the desired hydrogel shape and dimensions 2127 ( Figure 1).
0: Figure 1: Schematic of bulk hydrogel formation.
1: Hydrazide and aldehyde-functionalized polymer solutions (in water or aqueous buffer) are loaded into separate barrels of a double barrel syringe and then co-extruded through a static mixer into a cylindrical silicone mold.
2: Rapid  in situ gelation upon mixing forms a hydrazone crosslinked hydrogel, which is free standing (once the mold is removed) within seconds to minutes depending on concentration and functional group density of the precursor polymers.
3: Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.
0: To create degradable gel particles on the micron-scale, a reactive microfluidics method is described in which precursor polymer solutions are simultaneously mixed and emulsified using a soft lithography-templated microfluidic chip design, enabling the formation of mixed reactive polymer droplets that subsequently gel  in situ to form gel microparticles with sizes templated by the emulsion ( Figure 2) 3132.
0: Figure 2: Schematic of gel microparticle formation via reactive microfluidics.
1: (A,B) Hydrazide and aldehyde-functionalized polymer solutions (in water or aqueous buffer) are fed by syringe pump into separate reservoirs that are connected downstream across a zig-zag series of channels designed to create a pressure gradient preventing backflow.
2: The polymers are then mixed just before being sheared by paraffin oil flowing from both sides (also driven by a syringe pump) and forced through a nozzle, resulting in flow-focusing production of aqueous (polymer solution) droplets in a continuous paraffin oil phase (see (B) for an illustration of the nozzle area and the droplet formation process).
3: An additional two paraffin oil inlets are positioned after the nozzle to further separate the droplets in the collection channel to allow for complete gelation prior to particle removal from laminar flow, after which the resulting microparticulate gels are collected in a magnetically stirred beaker; (C) Picture of droplet generation process at the nozzle (note that hydrazide polymer is labeled as blue to illustrate mixing)
0: To create degradable gel particles on the nanoscale, a thermally-driven reactive self-assembly method is described in which a solution of one of the reactive precursor polymers (the "seed" polymer) is heated above its LCST to form a stable nanoaggregate that is subsequently crosslinked by the addition of the complementary reactive precursor polymer (the "crosslinking" polymer); the resulting hydrazone crosslinked nanogel has a size templated directly by the nanoaggregate ( Figure 3) 28.
0: Figure 3: Schematic of nanogel formation via thermally-driven reactive self-assembly.
1: An aqueous solution containing the (thermoresponsive) hydrazide-functionalized polymer is heated above its lower critical solution temperature to create a stable uncrosslinked nanoaggregate.
2: Following, an aldehyde-functionalized polymer is added to crosslink the nanoaggregate via hydrazone bond formation and thus stabilize the nanogel particle upon cooling below the LCST.

0: Introduction
0: The family Boraginaceae includes more than 2700 species commonly found in cosmopolitan habitats especially in Tropic, Turian (Iran) and Mediterranean regions [ 1].
1: Several species from this family has been traditionally used as diuretic, anti-inflammatory, diaphoretic and sedative as well as rheumatic pain and burns [ 2,  3].
2: From a chemical point of view, the species are characterised by naphthoquinones and its derivatives, pyrrolizidine alkaloids, phenolic compounds and its derivatives [ 4].
0: Glandora rosmarinifolia (Ten.)
1: D.C. Thomas (Boraginaceae) [synonyms:  Lithodora rosmarinifolia (Ten.)
2: I.M.
3: Johnst.
4: Lithospermum rosmarinifolium Ten.]
5: is a perennial shrub growing on rocky limestone habitats and cliffs in Algeria, Sicily and in the Sorrento peninsula (Italy) [ 5,  6,  7].
6: Glandora rosmarinifolia has been studied from a molecular [ 5], and morphological point of view [ 8,  9].
0: Few papers have been published on the chemical composition of  Glandora species (e.g.
1: G.  diffusa) [ 4,  10] but there are no studies on  G.  rosmarinifolia.
0: The aim of this study was to identify the chemical composition of the essential oil of aerial parts (branches with leaves) of  G.  rosmarinifolia obtained by hydrodistillation (HD), analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and to verify some biological activities on a panel of hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (HA22T/VGH, HepG2, Hep3B) and triple negative breast cancer cell lines (SUM 149, MDA-MB-231).
1: Both cancer models are highly aggressive with poor prognosis and are characterized by multi-drug resistance to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs [ 11,  12].
2: It is therefore desirable to investigate new therapeutic tools to overcome the adverse biological characteristic and drug resistance of these tumor models.
0: Introduction
0: Leishmaniasis caused by protozoa of the  Leishmania genus, one of the six infectious and parasitic diseases of major importance in the world, is endemic in 98 countries, present on four continents: Africa, America, Asia and Europe, with annual record of 1 million to 1.5 million cases ( 1).
1: Every year about 2 million new cases are notified, having a high detection rate and ability to produce deformities ( 2).
0: This disease occurs in 12 countries in Latin America, 90% of cases occurring in Brazil, especially in the Northeast region.
1: In the country, the disease is found throughout the Brazilian territory except for the Southern region.
2: Over the last 10 years, the annual average is of 3,156 cases, with an incidence of 2/100,000 cases per inhabitant.
3: It is most common in children under 10 years old, and proportionally males are most affected ( 2).
0: Another annoyance disease neglected is Chagas, which began millions of years ago as enzootic diseases of wild animals, and subsequently transmitted to human beings characterized as an anthropozoonosis.
1: Chagas disease is caused by the protozoan  T. cruzi, which has affected about 12 million people only in Latin America and 75 million people are likely to acquire it ( 3).
0: Pharmacotherapy for leishmaniasis treatment and Chagas disease is a little bit scarce ( 4).
1: This is due to commercial disinterest reflected by the fact that the parasitic diseases mainly affect developing countries, where the population has low purchasing power, leading to a low yield for factories, because the drugs would have to be affordable ( 5).
0: Chemotherapy with pentavalent antimony is widely used, but it is not free of side effects, requiring parenteral administration, extensive treatment and the emergence of resistance, justifying the search for effective alternative drugs, where medicinal plants are highlighted growing ( 6,  7).
1: Based on this reasoning, the World Health Organization (WHO) emphasizes the urgent need to develop new medicine for the prophylaxis of these diseases ( 8).
0: In popular medicine, some species of the  Piper genus showed antiparasitic activity; therefore may be required for employment as an alternative therapy ( 6).
1: In developed studies, many compounds derived from  Piper species have proven their parasitic activities ( 4,  6).
2: The  Piper betle extract showed activity against promastigotes of  Leishmania donovani ( 9),  Piper chaba was effective against promastigotes of  L. donovani varieties ( 10),  Piper hispidum was effective against amastigote form of  L. amazonensis ( 11), and the extracts and fractions of  Piper ovatum showed activity against the promastigote and amastigote varieties of  L. amazonensis ( 12).
3: Extracts and fractions of  Piper reginelli (Mic) DC.
4: var pallescens (C.
5: DC.)
6: Yunck were effective against promastigote form of  L. amazonensis ( 13).
0: In this way, it is believed that  P. tuberculatum Jacq.
1: has the potential to combat parasitic diseases, by their kinship degree with the above species.
2: P. tuberculatum Jacq.
3: is a Piperaceae of economic and medicinal importance, popularly known as monkey pepper, found in regions of the states: Amazonas, Rondonia, Para, Maranhao, Piaui, Ceara, Paraiba, Pernambuco, Rio de Janeiro and Mato Grosso.
4: It is used empirically as sedative antidote for snake venom ( 14) and in the treatment of stomach disorders ( 15).
0: In this study, the objective was to assess the possible anti-parasitic effect of the essential oil from the fruits of  P. tuberculatum Jacq., against lines of  L. braziliensis and  L. infantum as well as  T. cruzi, contributing to the search for therapeutic alternatives for these diseases.
0: Introduction
0: Several biological studies have been performed on many species of this genus which have confirmed their ethno pharmacological properties such as hypoglycemic ( 29), anti inflammatory ( 30), anabolic, analgestic, antiarthritis, antipyretic,hepatoprotective, antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant, cardiotonic ( 31), and antimalarial ( 32) properties and also their application in the treatment of join diseases ( 33) .
0: Many phytochemical studies on  Ajuga species were performed which led to the isolation of phytoecdysteroids ( 34,  35), clerodane and neoclerodane di terpenoids ( 36,  37), iridoids ( 38) as well as phenylethyl glycosides ( 39).

0: The secondary metabolites of medicinal plant in crude extracts are well known for their bioactivity such as chemo preventive agents against cancer.
1: In Asian countries historical background of medication shows that medicinal plants (products) have been utilized in cancer treatment (Abate et al., 2017[ 1]; Abebe et al., 2017[ 2]; Asif, 2015[ 5][ 7]; Cahyana et al., 2017[ 12]; Hamid et al., 2016[ 23]; Prasanna et al., 2011[ 41]; Yasir et al., 2016[ 53][ 54]).
2: Pinus roxburghii, also known as chir pine, is native to Himalayas and distributed over a range of Himalaya range of Pakistan, Bhutan, Afghanistan, China, Nepal and southern India (Shuaib et al., 2014[ 47]).
3: Five species of  Pinaceae including  P. roxburghii are found in Pakistan covering the total area of 1928 thousand hectares and mostly located in the rangelands of North West Frontier, Baluchistan and Punjab provinces (Hassan and Amjid, 2009[ 25]).
4: In Asian sub-continent,  P. roxburghii is traditionally used as a medicinal plant for the treatment of dermatological and topical diseases, gastrointestinal disorders, liver, spleen, ear, throat and skin, bronchitis, diaphoresis, giddiness, ulcer, inflammation, itching ailments and to cure snake bite (Sinha et al., 2013[ 48]).
5: Various authors reported the anti-cancer activities of medicinal plants (Chouaib et al., 2016[ 15]; Devi et al., 2015[ 16]; Heo et al., 2014[ 26]; Jose et al., 2016[ 30]; Khlifi et al., 2013[ 35]; Vuong et al., 2015[ 50]; Yessoufou et al., 2015[ 55]).
6: Apart from traditional usage of  P. roxburghii, the antidyslipidemic (Puri et al., 2011[ 42]), antioxidant (Qadir and Shah, 2014[ 43]; Salem et al., 2014[ 44]), anti-inflammatory, anticonvulsant, analgesic (Kaushik et al., 2012[ 32]), antiparasitic (Farooq et al., 2008[ 17]), antidiabetic (Kaushik et al., 2014[ 34]) and antimicrobial (Iqbal et al., 2011[ 28]) activities have also been reported.
7: Recent studies also revealed the anticancer activities of some species of  Pinacea family (Cho et al., 2014[ 14]; Jo et al., 2012[ 29]; Kaushik et al., 2015[ 33]; Yang et al., 2010[ 52]).
0: Chemical composition of  P. roxburghii (needles, stem, bark and essential oil) have been studied well (Iqbal et al., 2011[ 28]; Qadir and Shah, 2014[ 43]; Satyal et al., 2013[ 46]) and caryophyllene, thunbergol, 3-carene, cembrene and -pinene were the major constituents in  P. roxburghii extracts (Hassan and Amjid, 2009[ 25]; Salem et al., 2014[ 44]).
1: In view of considerable anticancer activities of  Pinacea family plants, it will be of worth to study the anticancer activity of  P. roxburghii plant.
2: Therefore, the present investigation was conducted to appraise the anticancer potential of  P. roxburghii leaves essential oil using different human cancer cell lines.
3: Moreover, chemical composition of  P. roxburghii essential oil (PREO) was also evaluated using advanced techniques.
4: For anticancer activity evaluation of PREO, initially, different cell lines were used.
5: After initial trails, two types of cells i.e., adherent (A549, HCT-116) and suspension (U-266, KBM-5) were selected.
6: For colony forming assay adherent cancer cell lines line HCT 116 are required, whereas KBM-5 cell line was used to study apoptosis effect of PREO.
0: Introduction
0: The worldwide adoption of genetically modified crop plants expressing toxic proteins of the bacterium  Bacillus thuringiensis (i.e.,  Bt toxins) was a response to the economic losses caused by lepidopteran pest species, particularly in maize and soybeans 1.
1: However, despite the importance of genetically modified  Bt plants on the integrated management of lepidopteran and coleopteran pests 2  4, the sustainability of this agricultural practice has been threatened by lack of information about the interaction of  Bt toxins (e.g., Cry proteins) with non-target organisms (including other relevant pests such as the phytosuccivorous insect pests) and the rapid evolution of high levels of resistance.
2: Indeed, recent studies described field-evolved  Bt-resistance in the fall armyworm  Spodoptera frugiperda to non-pyramided  Bt plants expressing Cry1F, Cry1A.
3: 105, Cry2Ab and Cry1Ab toxins as well as to the dual-gene  Bt (i.e., expressing Cry1A.105 and Cry2Ab toxins) maize 5  10.
4: Additionally, cases of cross-resistance between  Bt toxins and non- Bt conventional insecticides were reported in the diamondback moth  Plutella xylostella (i.e., pyrethroids and Cry1Ac toxin) and in  S.  frugiperda (i.e., organophosphates and Cry1F toxin) 11  14.
0: Plant-derived products such as essential oils are regarded as a complementary alternative for the integrated pest management of insect pests, as long as they are effective and pose lower health and environmental risks than synthetic insecticides 15  18.
1: However, major threats to these plant-derived insecticides (or bioinsecticides) becoming commercially available are the lack of regulatory priorities and policies favoring their sustainable uses 16,  17, which seem to be a changing pattern scenario 19.
0: The Neotropical region exhibits a diverse flora that remains largely underexploited as a source of biologically active substances.
1: The aromatic and medicinal Neotropical plant species  Siparuna guianensis Aubl.
2: (Siparunaceae), also commonly referred to as Negramina, ant bush or Capitiu, is a relevant example.
3: This plant species is widespread in South America, including the Brazilian Northeast and Mid-Western regions 20, and products derived from its leaves, bark, and flowers have been used in folk medicine 21  23.
4: However, there are few investigations on the insecticidal activity of the essential oils and their constituents from the leaf, stem, and fruits of  S.  guianensis.
5: Only recently, the essential oil of this plant species was explored for pest management with promising results against the mosquitos  Aedes aegypti and  Culex quinquefasciatus24, ticks 25, and the wax moths  Achroia grisella and  Galleria mellonella26.
0: Thus, the present study aimed at shedding further light on the insecticidal activity of the  S.  guianensis essential oil.
1: The chemical constituents of essential oils of  S.  guianensis were initially identified and subsequently tested on the velvetbean caterpillar  Anticarsia gemmatalis (Hubner), a key soybean pest species, and on  Bt-susceptible and resistant strains of the fall armyworm  Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E.
2: Smith), a key pest species of maize and soybeans.
3: The larvicidal, ovicidal, egg-laying deterrence and repellence properties of the  S.  guianensis essential oil were assessed, as was the potential impairment of larval walking activity of both caterpillar species.
4: We also assessed the toxicity of this essential oil on lepidopteran and human cell lines.
0: Background
0: Myrtaceae comprises 132 genera and 5671 species of trees and shrubs, which are distributed mainly in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, particularly South America, Australia and Tropical Asia [ 1].
1: It is one of the most prominent families in Brazil, represented by 23 genera and 1034 species, with occurrence in all regions of the country [ 2,  3].
2: Psidium is a genus with at least 60 to 100 species, occurring from Mexico and Caribbean to Argentina and Uruguay.
3: Therefore, it is naturally an American genus, although  P. guajava,  P. guineense and  P. cattleyanum are subtropical and tropical species in many other parts of the world [ 4].
0: Psidium guineense Swartz [syn.
1: Guajava guineensis (Sw.) Kuntze,  Myrtus guineensis (Sw.) Kuntze,  Psidium araca Raddi,  P. guyanense Pers.,  P. laurifolium O. Berg,  P. rotundifolium Standl.,  P. sprucei O. Berg, among others [ 5] ( www.tropicos.org/Name/22102032) is a native shrub or small tree up to about 6 m high occurring in all Brazilian biomes, commonly known as Araca.
2: It has a berry-type fruit with yellow, red or purple peel and whitish pulp, rich in minerals and functional elements, such as vitamin C and phenolic compounds [ 6 9].
3: The leaves and pulp of Araca have been used as an anti-inflammatory remedy for wound healing and oral antibacterial agent [ 10,  11], as well as it presented antibacterial activity against pathogenic microorganisms [ 11 13].
4: Some essential oils of Araca were previously described: Foliar oil from a specimen growing in Arizona, USA, with predominance of -bisabolene, -pinene and limonene [ 14]; foliar oil from a specimen collected in Roraima, Brazil, with -bisabolol,  epi--bisabolol and limonene as the main constituents [ 15]; and another foliar oil from a specimen sampled in Mato Grosso do Sul Brazil, where spathulenol was the primary volatile compound [ 16].
0: The present work aimed at investigating the variability of the chemical composition of the essential oils of different specimens of  Psidium guineense, occurring in the Amazon region, to contribute to the knowledge of its chemical types.
0: Background
0: With the advent of several emerging novel chemical entities, delivery of high molecular weight and poorly soluble bioactive molecules remains a challenging task.
1: Therapeutic efficacy of low soluble molecules (BCS Class II and IV) is generally high and hence the design of oral delivery systems with improved dissolution and permeability characteristics cannot be ignored [ 1] However, poor solubility characters pose greater inter/intra subject variabilities and dose disproportionalities.
2: Yet, most of the novel strategies still remain open for developing versatile oral drug delivery systems since the route of administration is salient [ 2,  3].
3: However, development of stable and acceptable dosage forms for lipophilic drugs is an ever challenging task for the researchers.
0: In times of yore, many attempts were made to deliver lipophilic/hydrophobic moieties for better therapeutic outcomes.
1: Of late, Oral Emulsified Lipid Delivery Systems (OELDS) was instigated with sulphonamide lipid emulsions [ 4].
2: In such systems, incorporation of poorly water-soluble drugs into the inert core of carriers composed of oils, surfactants, and cosolvents, enables them to solubilize in GI fluids by forming a colloidal dispersion.
3: Microemulsions, nanoemulsions, Self Microemulsifying/Nano emulsifying Drug Delivery Systems (SMEDDS/SNEDDS), Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), Nanoparticulate lipid structures (NLS) are recognized as frontline approaches in OELDS [ 5,  6].
4: Amongst these, particulate micro/nanoemulsified systems are particularly germane to communication are fundamental approaches for revolutionary strategies have gained good research due to their potentials in increasing both lymphatic and portal circulation [ 7].
5: Nevertheless, therapeutic outcomes of OELDS are affected by particle/droplet size, the rate of dispersion, emulsification time and precipitation of drug in GIT.
6: Moreover, dietary edible oils which exhibit typical food effect on absorption of drugs owing to structural and functional similarities with that of the physiological lipids, offer better tolerance.
0: Based on the potential considerations of ME/NEs as an appealing substitute, the review was undertaken to emphasize typical biopharmaceutical aspects of oral absorption, including enzymes, transporters, and carriers involved therein.
1: Distribution and elimination attributes of ME/NEs are also discussed here.
2: Although both the emulsified particulate systems differ in droplet size, composition, and physicochemical properties, there is a firm connection in their in-vivo performance.
3: Therefore, both the emulsion systems and their subtypes, self-micro/nano emulsifying drug delivery systems are explicated together.
0: Introduction
0: Desi ghee is a type of liquid butter obtained from cow/buffalo milk by adding yogurt culture[ 1].
1: It has been widely used in subcontinent (Pakistan, India and Bangladesh) and across the world at large from centuries and a best source of lipid nutrients, fat soluble vitamins and essential fatty acids[ 2].
2: Composition of desi ghee mainly consists of 62% monounsaturated fats and is rich in conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and vitamin A[ 3, 4].
3: CLA is a blend of linoleic acid isomers which accounts for 7590% of total CLA isomers[ 3, 5].
4: Due to enriched content of CLA, desi ghee has been reported as an antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, antidiabetic, antiatherogenic, and antiadipogenic properties[ 3].
5: It has also been reported for anticancer characteristics and for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, strengthening the immune function and modifying body composition to treat obesity or build lean body mass[ 6, 7].
0: Cooking and frying of food in oil or ghee is common to human and preservation of their natural ingredients during frying/cooking of food is an important issue.
1: The molecular structures of vitamins, antioxidants, saturated and unsaturated fats in edible oils and desi ghee are very sensitive to temperature and it causes the degradation of above said nutritional ingredients.
2: Therefore, it becomes very necessary to investigate temperature effects on molecular composition of desi ghee.
0: Fluorescence spectroscopy has proved itself as an excellent nondestructive analytical technique with high specificity and sensitivity for the characterization of edible oils, thermal effects on olive oil during heating and storage, thermal processing of milk fats and dry milk storage effects[ 8 17].
1: A number of research papers have been published for the investigation of temperature effects on edible oils using Fluorescence spectroscopy[ 11, 15 20] but no study has been made so far reporting such effects on the molecular composition of desi ghee.
2: Cheikhousman et al.
3: employed Fluorescence spectroscopy to investigate the thermal deterioration of olive oil by heating the samples at 170C and reported possible deterioration of different ingredients including vitamin E[ 16].
4: Microwave and conventional heating effects have been studied by applying fluorescence spectroscopy on mixtures of olive oil samples[ 18].
5: It has also been used on heated samples of olive oil mixed with sunflower oil for their discrimination[ 15].
6: F.G. Vila reported detailed molecular composition of olive oil and the effects of temperature using fluorescence spectroscopy[ 11].
7: Similarly, evolution of fluorescence compounds has been studied by fluorescence spectroscopy during the thermal deterioration of olive oil[ 17].
8: Temperature effects on extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) have been suggested a temperature range from 140 to 190C where minimum variations in its molecular composition have been observed[ 19].
9: Literature review indicates that only a few article appear regarding desi ghee attributes[ 1, 2, 21], where gas chromatography has been employed to investigate the effects of storage on chemical properties of desi ghee[ 21].
10: In another study explained molecular composition of desi ghee along with margarines and different edible oils[ 22].
11: Recently, Saleem et al.
12: defined a safe cooking temperature range for EVOO where it almost retains its nutritional values[ 23].
0: In the present study, Fluorescence spectroscopy has been utilized as a tool to investigate molecular composition of desi ghee obtained from buffalo milk and heating effects on its natural ingredients.
1: In addition, fluorescence spectra of vitamins A, E, D, K and CLA are recorded and compared with the fluorescence spectra of buffalo ghee.
2: Results suggested a temperature range that can be used for cooking/frying with desi ghee without destroying its valuable ingredients.
0: Buffalo ghee is very common and popular in subcontinent for frying and cooking food.
1: In order to investigate the heating effects on its molecular composition, present study has been planned and it got approval from the ethics committee at National Institute of Lasers and Optronics Islamabad.
0: Background
0: Malaria, a widespread disease in tropical and subtropical regions (including much of sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and the Americas), can cause symptoms that include fever, headache, vomiting, and even progress to coma or death [ 1].
1: As the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated, there were 216 million documented cases and more than 445,000 deaths from malaria in 2016 [ 2].
2: As a mosquito-borne infectious disease, malaria can be caused by a bite from an infected mosquito, which can introduce the malaria parasites into the circulatory system of the human and ultimately to the liver, where they mature and reproduce [ 3].
0: Among mosquitoes,  Anopheles is the only vector of human malaria [ 4] and, of these, 3040 species commonly transmit parasites of the genus  Plasmodium [ 5].
1: Anopheles anthropophagus and  Anopheles sinensis have been chosen as the test target mosquito species in this research, because they are rife and harmful in China.
2: The mosquito  An.
3: sinensis is a member of the  Anopheles hyrcanus group, distinguished from other series by the presence of pale bands (usually four) on the palpi and a tuft of dark scales on the clypeus on each side.
4: Anopheles anthropophagus is a major vector in central China, able to spread malaria 1820 times better than  An.
5: sinensis [ 6,  7].
6: The larvae of  An.
7: anthropophagus and  An.
8: sinensis live on the surface of water.
9: Compared to adults, the ability of larvae to escape the insecticide is limited, so the time from larvae to adult is an important period to control mosquitoes [ 8].
0: Generally, mosquito larval control is carried out by conventional synthetic insecticides, which have high efficiency and low cost.
1: Their efficacy may decay gradually because mosquitoes develop resistance against insecticides [ 9].
2: By contrast, plant essential oils, often obtained from the plant by steam distillation or hydrodistillation, constitute a rich source of bioactive compounds [ 10], and have emerged as a good alternative larvicidal or adulticidal agents with fewer insect resistance problems [ 11].
3: Biodegradable and nontoxic, they can be used as an eco-friendly tool as well as an economical agent in vector control [ 12].
0: Zanthoxylum acanthopodium is a shrub or small tree in the  Zanthoxylum genus of  Citrus family, native to southern China, Bangladesh, Bhutan, northern India, Nepal, Laos, Burma, northern Thailand Vietnam, Indonesia, and Peninsular Malaysia.
1: It has 513 alternate leaves with serrated edge (38 cm long and 12 cm wide) and axillary inflorescences with densely globose clusters of unisexual flowers [ 13].
2: Much like the closely related  Zanthoxylum piperitum, it has similar tongue-numbing characteristic seed pericarps, which are often used as spices in cooking, and traditional Chinese medicine reported great effect on contraception, relieving pain and killing parasites [ 13].
3: Additionally, the hydrodistilled essential oil from  Zanthoxylum acanthopodium, with many active ingredients, is a novel agent with special effect.
4: In the present study, the chemical composition of the essential oil from  Zanthoxylum acanthopodium was determined and its larvicidal activity was evaluated against  An.
5: anthropophagus and  An.

1: Introduction
0: Citrus aurantium L. (Rutaceae), commonly known as bitter orange, is usually utilized as a flavoring and acidifying agent for food [ 1].
1: Besides the essential oil and its components [ 2,  3], the fruits of  C. aurantium are sources of flavonoid-type compounds with diverse biological effects [ 4 6].
2: Additionally, it was reported that flavonoid glycosides were isolated from the plant [ 7] and the biogenic amine and flavanone contents have been determined [ 8,  9].
3: Due to the abundance of health-giving secondary metabolites,  C. aurantium is also used for the treatment of several ailments such as anxiety [ 10], lung and prostate cancers [ 11], and gastrointestinal disorders and obesity [ 2,  12].
4: Due to the prohibition of  Ephedra sinica Stapf.
5: in Farw.-containing weight loss products in the market,  C. aurantium has found an important place as a preferable agent to replace ephedra, as it contains  p-synephrine, a phenylethanolamine type alkaloid, which is chemically similar to adrenergic agents, as appetite suppressants [ 12 14].
6: Recently, several scientific studies investigating the potential effects of various parts (including flowers, fruits, and essential oils) of  C. aurantium have been conducted [ 15 17].
0: In the last years, phytopharmaceuticals have shown an outstanding role in new drug discovery [ 18 20].
1: Both in the crude form as well as pure chemical entities, a large population around the globe are getting therapeutic benefits from them [ 21 23].
2: In this review article, we have aimed to overview the bioactivity studies performed on  C. aurantium revealing its therapeutic potential in the light of isolated molecules and/or essential oils.
0: Introduction
0: High animal protein intake has been linked to increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, colorectal cancer and early deaths, whereas plant proteins have shown significant protective effects [ 1,  2].
1: A major source of gas emissions is ruminant-based animal production.
2: It has been estimated that in the European Union, the livestock sector accounts for between 12 and 61% of the total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions [ 3].
3: There is therefore an urgent need to shift towards a more plant-based diet, for both environmental and public health reasons.
0: Faba bean ( Vicia faba), lupin ( Lupinus angustifolius), rapeseed ( Brassica rapa/napus subsp.
1: Oleifera), flaxseed ( Linum usitatissimum), oil hemp ( Cannabis sativa), buckwheat ( Fagopyrum esculentum), and quinoa ( Chenopodium quinoa) may offer good alternatives to soybean, and contribute to enhancing diversity as well as the environmental and economic sustainability of local agricultural production.
2: They are also a rich source of energy, fiber, high quality protein, macro- and micronutrients, as are good sources of bioactive non-nutrient compounds [ 4 7].
0: From a nutritional point of view, the most important aspects of a protein source are its AA and EAA content, composition and digestibility.
1: As mentioned above, plant protein sources can also offer other nutrients and bioactive compounds.
0: There is still insufficient knowledge of the compositional data of faba bean, lupin, rapeseed press cake, flaxseed, oil hemp, buckwheat, and quinoa, as well as the effect of processing.
1: The goal of the present study was to determine the various nutrients in the commercial products of these crops.
0: The commercial samples of whole unpearled ( n = 1) and pearled ( n = 1) quinoa seed, whole lupin seed ( n = 2), rapeseed press cake ( n = 2), dehulled buckwheat seed ( n = 3), buckwheat bran ( n = 1), whole faba bean ( n = 3), hulled and grinded faba bean ( n = 1), whole flaxseed ( n = 3), whole oil hemp seed ( n = 4), and hulls of oil hemp ( n = 3) were purchased from local grocery stores or directly from farmers/producers.
1: The sample size varied 500-1000 g. Pearled quinoa seeds were pre-processed by the farmer using abrasive milling (i.e.
2: pearling) to remove the saponin-rich outer layer of the seed.
3: Buckwheat samples were dehulled and rapeseed press cakes were produced from cold-pressing processes by the manufacturers.
4: All unmilled or coarse samples were milled before analyses using a KT-120 hammer mill with a 1mm sieve (Koneteollisuus Oy, Klaukkala, Finland).
5: All milled samples were stored in a freezer at 20 C before being analyzed.
0: Introduction
0: Management of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) related to neglected tropical diseases has become a global health public concern [ 1].
1: The discovery of novel prophylactic or therapeutic treatments against arboviruses remain a continuous goal aimed to counter emerging virus or new viral strains [ 2].
2: Ross River virus (RRV) is a small enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the alphavirus genus, family  Togarividae [ 3].
3: The RRV incubation period in humans was estimated to be from 7 to 9 days [ 4] and like the well-known Chikungunya virus that belongs to the same viral family, it typically causes fever, rash and polyarthralgia [ 5,  6].
4: RRV is endemic in Australia where it is the most common mosquito-borne pathogen with an average of 5000 cases annually [ 7,  8].
5: After the major outbreak in the Pacific area in 1979 and 1980, serological studies revealed the silent circulation of RRV in the Fiji islands [ 9] and more recently in French Polynesia [ 10,  11].
0: Two biological characteristics distinguish RRV from other alphaviruses: more than 40 species of mosquitoes can act as its vectors, thus, providing a large number of potential amplification cycles, and numerous warm blood host (mainly marsupials) support this viruss replication [ 12].
1: This provides numerous opportunities for RRV to infect humans and initiate outbreak foci [ 13].
2: Indeed, during 2017, a large outbreak was observed in the South-West Region of Australia with more than 2 thousand cases reported in less than 2 months.
3: Because the infection lead to very painful and debilitating joint, up to months after the initial onset, the disease has a direct impact on health services and calls for direct responses from the Australian authorities [ 14].
4: Consequently, RRV for which no efficient treatment is available, remains a major focus of basic research, and necessitates on-going surveys by the Australian health services [ 13,  15 18].
5: Mannose binding lectin (MBL) has been proposed as an efficient therapeutic target to alleviate RRV-induced arthritis but to date only pentosan sulfate, initially approved for the treatment of cystitis in U.S., is available [ 19,  20].
6: In an  in vitro re-evaluation of 40 plants species used in Australian folk medicine, inhibition of RRV-induced cytopathic effect (2550%) was observed with the ethanolic extract of  Myoporaceae and  Pittosporaceae species [ 21].
7: Essential oils are natural complex mixtures and their antiviral properties are due to complementary and overlapping mechanisms, as assumed for herpes simplex virus (HSV), influenza virus and yellow fever virus.
8: To date, the anti-infective properties of essential oils, though of growing interest, have not been explored for RRV [ 22 24].
0: In arboviruses-related control measures, a number of essential oils are exploited as topical repellents to reduce the incidence of mosquito bites [ 25].
1: However, as yet these have not been investigated for antiviral activity at the site of infection, the skin, where they could be absorbed percutaneously.
2: Such additional benefits of skin-applied essential oils may offer a great opportunity to control the early stages of infection, even when their repelling action fails.
3: Cymbopogon citratus,  Vetiveria zizanioides (family: Poaceae) and  Pelargonium graveolens (family: Geraniaceae) are distributed worldwide and their essential oils (denoted hereafter as CC, VZ and PG, respectively), are readily available and have notable mosquito repellent properties [ 26].
4: The aim of the present study was to investigate the inhibitory effects  in vitro of these three common essential oils at non-cytotoxic concentrations against RRV.
5: We assessed their effects on both virus entry using the wild-type of RRV-T48 strain (RRV-T48) and viral replication using a recombinant RRV expressing  Renilla reniformis luciferase (RRV- renLuc).
0: Introduction
0: Although viruses, bacteria or fungi are commonly known to be pathogenic to animals and humans, the algae of the genus  Prototheca may also present a threat.
1: Potentially pathogenic species of this type are  Prototheca wickerhamii and  Prototheca zopfii [ 1].
0: Prototheca zopfii is mainly responsible for infection in animals, and the most common protothecosis is mastitis.
1: The disease causes serious economic losses.
2: Infection results in reduced production and poorer quality of milk, and the infected cows are usually slaughtered.
3: The pathogen is transmitted through sick animals and the environment: drinking water, slurry, feces, the walls and floors in stalls, equipment and cups of milk [ 2].
4: A number of factors are known to promote infection, including age of cows, number of episodes, past inflammation and treatment method.
5: The cows are more vulnerable in the early lactation stage [ 2,  3].
6: Treating  Prototheca mastitis is difficult, and the applied therapy is beset by resistance, which may be caused by the presence of sporopollenin in the algal cell wall [ 2].
7: Commonly used antibacterial and antifungal agents are ineffective, despite demonstrating biological activity in vitro.
8: Despite many attempts, the use of intramammary administration of levamisole and tetramisole has failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy [ 2,  4].
0: Due to the increasing resistance of microbial strains, including pathogenic algae, to synthetic drugs and the limited use of chemotherapeutics, increasing numbers of anti-algae are being sought in nature.
1: Fortunately, plants are sources of many new and potentially effective substances [ 5] that may be employed in the treatment of protothecosis.
2: The healing and antimicrobial properties of essential oils derived from plants have been known for centuries.
3: Various studies have examined the effects of essential oil application against  Prototheca strains [ 6 9].
0: The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of essential oils obtained from  Thymus vulgaris L.,  Origanum vulgare L.,  Origanum majerana L.,  Mentha   piperita L. and  Allium ursinum L. against  P. zopfii strains that cause inflammation of the udder (mastitis) in cows.
1: The study used thyme, marjoram, mint [ 6,  8,  10,  11], oregano [ 6,  11,  12] and bear garlic oils [ 13,  14], which are believed to have antifungal and anti-algae effects.
2: Peppermint oil is recommended for mastitis therapy.
3: Japanese mint oil is a particularly effective remedy for inflammation due to its higher menthol content [ 15].
0: Introduction
0: Plants play a vital role in cultural, social, religious, environmental, and nutritional aspects.
1: Among all other purposes, the use of plants as medicine for human health originated ~60,000 years ago in the mid-Paleolithic age (Solecki,  1975).
2: To date, 391,000 vascular plants had been identified (Willis and Bachman,  2016).
3: Of these, only about 6% of plants were screened for their biological activity and 15% for their phytoconstituents (Verpoorte,  2000).
4: Among those,  Moringa is one of the most important genuses with outstanding economic importance.
5: This genus is potentially used in traditional medicine, pharmacological screening and chemical constituents identification.
6: The genus  Moringa consist of 13 species viz.,  M. arborea, M. borziana, M. concanensis, M. drouhardii, M. hildebrandtii, M. longituba, M. oleifera, M. ovalifolia, M. peregrina, M. pygmaea, M. rivae, M. ruspoliana, and  M. stenopetala.
7: The history of  Moringa dates back to 150 BC.
8: The taxon name  Moringa was derived from the Tamil word murunggi or the Malayalam word muringa (Quattrocchi,  2000).
9: Historical proof showed that various civilizations viz., Indian, Greek, and Egyptian were using Moringa for thousands of years for several purposes.
10: They preferred to take the leaves and fruits of  Moringa in their diet to maintain their skin health and mental fitness.
11: In the warfront, the ancient Maurian warriors of India were fed the leaf extracts of  Moringa as it was believed that the decoction relieves them from the pain and stress incurred during the war.
12: Moreover, the drink provides added energy in the war field (Jahn,  1996; Fuglie,  2001; Manzoor et al.,  2007).
13: Edible oil with pleasant taste (Ben oil) from the seeds of  Moringa was highly valued by the civilizations of ancient Greek, Roman, and Egyptian for protecting their skin and making perfume.
14: Since the middle and old kingdoms (30002000 BC), the ben oil was used by the Egyptians (Miller and Morris,  1988; ICUN,  2005).
0: The previous studies on the  Moringa genus were mainly concentrated on  M. oleifera (Gilani et al.,  1994; Pal et al.,  1995,  1996; Anwar et al.,  2007; Santos et al.,  2012; Stohs and Hartman,  2015; Goswami et al.,  2016; Leone et al.,  2016; Saini et al.,  2016; Asensi et al.,  2017; Kalappurayil and Joseph,  2017; Mallya et al.,  2017; Mangundayao and Yasurin,  2017) since the species is common in Africa and Asia where the common people are search for nutritional foods in an inexpensive way to meet their demand of food sources (Wangcharoen and Gomolanee,  2011).
1: Recently,  M. peregrina is gaining more attention due to traditional, nutritional, industrial and medicinal values.
2: As this plant has wide range of medicinal uses, it has been screened for various pharmacological activities in the past few decades (Marwah et al.,  2007; Soltan and Zaki,  2009; Koheil et al.,  2011; Dehshahri et al.,  2012; Lalas et al.,  2012; Al-Owaisi et al.,  2014; Moustafa et al.,  2014; Majali et al.,  2015; Safaeian et al.,  2015; Ullah et al.,  2015; Alrayes et al.,  2016; El-Awady et al.,  2016; Azim et al.,  2017; Elabd et al.,  2017; Saleh et al.,  2017).
3: Few active molecules were also isolated, identified and reported for various pharmacological activities.
4: An overview of health applications and salient modes of actions of phytoconstituents from  M. peregrina are illustrated in Figure  1.
5: Recently, Robiansyah et al.
6: ( 2014) reviewed the current status of  M. peregrina on its nutrient content, medicinal properties, phenotypic and genetic variation and conservation status.
7: But there was no much information about traditional medicinal values, pharmacological activities and phytochemistry of this plant.
8: Therefore, the present review is aimed to summarize the up-to-date information on the traditional uses, pharmacological activities and phytochemistry of  M. peregrina.

1: Introduction
0: Since immemorial time, the human has used plants, first to feed himself and then to heal himself.
1: He learned, step by step, to recognize the edible plants from poisonous plants, using some of them for warlike, criminal, and magic purposes or to facilitate fishing or hunting.
2: This relationship has become more and more intimate and diversified, for the satisfaction of nutritional (food, condiments, and drinks), aromatic (perfume), medicinal, and ornamental needs.
0: Thus, a plant is considered toxic when it contains one or more harmful substances for humans or animals and whose use causes various disorders more or less serious or even death ( Figure 1) [ 1,  2].
0: This definition must take into account the place of cultivation of the plant and the time of its collection, the active principle of the toxic plant which is distributed throughout the plant or preferentially in one or more of its parts, root, berries, or leaves, and finally the notion of the administered dose [ 3,  4].
0: The Antipoison Center and Pharmacovigilance of Morocco (ACPM) are sounding the alarm about the frequency and severity of poisoning due to the plants, as shown in  Figure 2, taken from its annual report.
0: Thus, we thought it is necessary to study the nature of these poisonous plants and their monographs.
0: The poisoning reported in the ACPM shows that the use of plants and products of the traditional pharmacopoeia (PPTP) is far from being negligible.
1: Indeed, faced with the abundance of Moroccan flora, a large slice of the population prefers to heal naturally by herbal preparations alone or in mixtures.
2: However, PPTP may contain powerful chemical compounds, responsible for adverse effects and significant toxicity and hence the need for continuous vigilance [ 5,  6].
0: According to the ACPM study from 1980 to 2008, plant poisoning accounted for 5.1% of all poisonings and ranked 7th after drugs (28.3%), gaseous products (23.3%), food (15.2%), pesticides (11.2%), household products (5.8%), and industrial products (5.2%) [ 1,  7].
0: So, we used the classification of ACPM for toxic plants in Morocco, to try to develop the monographs in order of gravity according to  Table 1.
0: Indeed, to get closer to these plants and before developing their monographs, we present in  Table 2, the different nomenclatures and the families to which they belong.

1: Introduction
0: In the last decade, research into essential (volatile) oils has received increasing attention from both industrial and academic sectors because of the growing interest in green consumerism and the need for alternative techniques to assure the quality and safety of perishable foods [ 1].
1: The plant  Melaleuca alternifolia (M. alternifolia) belongs to the Myrtaceae family [ 2], which is described as a scrubland species and found throughout South America, western India, and Australia [ 3].
2: The plant has been used in medicine, cosmetics, food, agriculture, and other industries [ 4 7].
3: In recent years,  M. alternifolia has also been gradually introduced in southern China.
4: The essential oil of  M. alternifolia is derived by steam or hydrodistillation from  M. alternifolia as secondary metabolites and is monoterpene-rich, volatile oil characterized by a strong odor [ 8,  9].
0: Several studies conducted on natural plant essential oils have indicated that these oils may be used as antimicrobial agents and have potential use in industrial applications [ 10 12].
1: M. alternifolia, also known as tea tree, has been investigated as an alternative antimicrobial agent [ 13]; however, there is no information that focuses exclusively on the antioxidant activities of the essential oil from  M. alternifolia.
2: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the  in vitro antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil from  M. alternifolia.
0: Introduction
0: Widespread use of Dietary Supplements (DS) is commonly seen among people belonging to different ethnicities, backgrounds, ages and genders across the globe despite insufficient evidence about their safety, efficacy and regulatory guidelines  1,   2.
1: According to National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data (NHANES) conducted between year cycles 19711974 and 2003-2006, the age adjusted consumption of DS has gradually increased in male (28% to 44%) and female (38% to 53%) consumer groups  3.
2: High consumption is especially seen among adults aged 60 y with 70% of older adults in the United States reported using one or more DS  4.
0: Most people consider DS as safe and usually take them without consulting with healthcare providers.
1: However, there is increasing evidence that DS could interact with prescription medicine and also cause serious adverse events.
2: According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an average of 23,000 annual emergency visits were related to DS in US  5.
3: Unlike prescription and over-the-counter medicines, DS are regulated by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA)  6 and unlike drugs, clinical trials on DS safety and efficacy before getting marketed are not required.
4: In addition, it is voluntary for healthcare providers to report only serious adverse events, including hospitalization, disability, and death, related to DS in the post-market surveillance.
5: Current safety documentation for DS is very limited as most available information is based either on pharmacologic research, animal models or pharmaco-epidemiologic studies that often solely focus on a small set of drugs or supplements.
6: These have greatly limited our ability to build up our knowledge on safety of DS.
0: Integrating information across diverse resources (e.g., online databases, biomedical literature) and further developing a data model to comprehensively represent DS and relevant safety information could potentially fill the knowledge gap to improve DS product safety.
1: Common online sources for DS information include commercial databases such as Natural Medicines (NM), a primarily ingredient level resource, and publically available databases, such as U.S. Dietary Supplement Label Database (DSLD) and Canadian Natural Health Product Ingredient database (NHPID), which are both considered as product level resources.
2: Product labeling statements in these resources contain very limited safety information.
3: There remains a critical need to more fully represent supplements by linking these databases using a common data model.
4: Accurate and comprehensive supplement representation is also vital for accurate information extraction from both the biomedical literature and online databases.
0: Our prior work demonstrated number of gaps with regards to term representation in existing standard terminologies (Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), RxNorm and National Drug File-Reference Terminology (NDF-RT)) and clinical notes within Electronic Health Records  7,   8.
1: Currently, no prior work has been done to comprehensively represent DS and the associated data model.
2: In this study, we selected five online databases for DS, both at the ingredient and product level, and compared them against the list of data elements considered essential to comprehensively represent DS.
3: This is the initial step towards the development of formal DS terminology/ontology model that could represent DS related information in a more accurate and consistent format, similar to drugs.
4: The knowledge gained here will promote informatics research in DS, such as information extraction and knowledge discovery of safety on DS.
0: Current DS resources have term coverage at different levels of granularity (i.e., ingredient and/or product level), and are employed for various purposes by a wide range of users (e.g., pharmacist, physicians, manufacturers, etc.)
1: The knowledge representation within these resources ranges from unstructured and fragmented to structured and comprehensive evidence based data having full monographs/controlled vocabularies and to the most structured and robust standardized terminologies.
2: By definition, monograph is a document having detailed information on a concept while controlled vocabularies are the list of standardized terms employed for indexing and searching information for a particular concept while.
3: Even within these terminological systems, variability exists in term as well as content coverage (related metadata coverage for each DS e.g., product name, active ingredient(s), drug strength and unit of measure, dosage form)  9.
0: The objective of this study is to evaluate and compare existing online resources for DS representation.
1: Common sources for DS information include databases such as, Dietary Supplement Ingredient Database (DSID)  10, Natural Medicine (NM)  11, Natural Health Products Ingredients Database (NHPID)  12, Dietary Supplement Label Database (DSLD)  13, and Licensed Natural Health Products Database (LNHPD)  14.
2: Some drug databases also incorporate DS coverage to variable extent, e.g., DailyMed  15, drugs.com  16, etc., which are not included in this study.
3: This goal is achieved through systematic review of selected resources at both the ingredient and product levels, compilation of the essential elements for DS representation as a preliminary model, and a comparison of the existing databases using this model as a check-list.
4: To achieve this goal, we examined element of three ingredient level databases (DSID, NM, & NHPID) and two product level resources (DSLD & LNHPD), to assess areas of uniqueness, overlaps and gaps where further information may be beneficial.
0: Introduction
0: In all aerobic organisms, including human beings, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is balanced by antioxidant defense system.
1: A serious imbalance between the production of ROS and antioxidant defense system is responsible for oxidative stress.
2: Thus, ROS plays an important role in the etiology of many diseases and aging.
3: Antioxidant defense system which prevents oxidative damages of ROS consist of flavanoids, carotenoids, phenolic compounds, vitamins, and antioxidant enzymes ( 1).
4: Although there are some synthetic antioxidants such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) which is commonly used in processed food, it has been reported that these compounds have some side effects ( 2).
5: Recently, there has been increasing interest in finding plants with high antioxidant capacities since they can protect human body from free radicals and retard the progression of many chronic diseases ( 3- 5).
0: Various medicinal properties have been ascribed to natural herbs.
1: Medicinal plants constitute the main source of new pharmaceuticals and healthcare products.
2: Plant products are also known to possess potential for food preservation.
0: Sweet marjoram [ Origanum majorana L. syn.
1: Majorana hortensis Moench], a member of the Lamiaceae family, is of great economic and industrial importance ( 6).
2: Lamiaceae consists of more than 150 species occurring mainly in the Mediterranean area and are used as herbal teas for their (folk) medicinal properties.
3: Origanum is represented in Turkey by 22 species or 32 taxa, 21 being endemic to Turkey.
4: Out of 52 known taxa of  Origanum, 60% are recorded to grow in Turkey ( 7).
5: Lamiaceae plants were widely studied as natural antioxidant sources because of their high contents of polyphenols ( 8).
0: O. majorana is one of the most important aromatic plants that contain major antioxidants such as flavonoids and triterpenoids ( 9).
1: Phenolic acids and flavonoids have been reported to play a role in the prevention of human pathologies ( 10).
2: Food and Drug Administration regard  O. majorana to be generally safe.
0: Genus  Origanum is used as anti-diabetic, carminative, tonic, digestive, stimulant, expectorant, menstrual regulator, diuretic, and for respiratory problems such as asthma.
1: Aqueous and ethanolic extracts from marjoram played a role in preventing carcinogenesis and oncogenic mutations ( 11).
2: These extracts caused alterations in methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase activity which is highly expressed in human cancers.
3: O. majoranas crude drug extracts exerted a low cytotoxicity on five human liver-cancer cell lines studied with an average of 39.1% ( 12).
4: Commercial  O. majorana oil is used as a spice and condiment.
5: The oil is used in perfumery for its spicy herbaceous notes ( 13) and as fungicides or insecticides in pharmaceutical and industrial products ( 14).
0: Linalool is monoterpene compound reported to be major volatile components of the essential oils of several aromatic species.
1: Linalool (3,7-dimethyl-1,6-octadien-3-ol) is one of the commonly used chemicals in cosmetic products and the fragrance and perfume industry.
2: Safety evaluation studies revealed that linalool is not irritating, phototoxic or sensitizing but has a low order of acute toxicity ( 15).
0: Hepatoma G2 cells (Hep G2) are considered a good model to study  in vitro xenobiotic metabolism and toxicity to the liver, since they retain many of the specialized functions which characterize normal human hepatocytes ( 16).
1: Also, Hepatoma G2 cells are a valuable model to study hepatocellular carcinoma and the liver, where drugs are metabolized ( 17).
0: In another experiment, we studied phenolic terpenoid carvacrols (main component of  O. majorana essential oil) cytotoxicity, cytoprotective and membrane protective effects on Hep G2 cells ( 18).
1: Therefore, we used linalool (second main component of  O. majorana essential oil) for this experiment.
0: The aim of our work was to compare cytotoxic and membrane-damaging effects of  O. majorana essential oil and its oxygenated monoterpene component linalool on the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Hep G2 and to investigate their possible protective (antioxidant) effects against H 2O 2 induced membrane damage.

1: Introduction
0: Pain comes in many forms: acute, chronic, visceral, inflammatory, or neuropathic [ 1,  2].
1: It is not simply a result of tissue damage but also reflects the influence of many psychological variables such as attention, anxiety, stress [ 3], suggestion, or previous experiences and may have a significant genetic contribution [ 4].
2: Pain accompanies most pathologies present in current medical practice, and 25% percent of Americans, for example, experience pain on a daily basis.
3: Having the numbers on its side, pain became a global public health problem and a leading cause of disability all over the world [ 5].
0: As life expectancy is rising and chronical pathologies along with it, the prevalence of accompanying pain is expected to increase yearly, with higher prevalence in elderly patients, where the treatment is also more sensitive [ 6,  7].
1: Considering the above, new therapeutic agents with increased efficacy, less side effects, and lower costs and leading to an improved quality of life [ 8 11] should become one of the primary objectives in modern medical research, together with constant monitoring [ 12] of the previous mentioned aspects.
0: The medicinal use of plants as analgesic drugs in folk medicine is an ancient tradition, far older than the current sciences of medicine in developing countries [ 13,  14].
1: According to estimations, up to 70,000 plant species are used ethnomedicinally worldwide.
2: Effects of herbal extracts have been studied by different pain tests including writhing test, light tail flick test, tail immersion test, hot-plate test, and formalin test [ 15].
0: The exploration for new analgesic combinations from the enormous arrays of medicinal plant resources is growing.
1: This is because such information holds guarantees for the finding of new therapeutic agents capable of inhibiting, decreasing, or relieving pain [ 16 28].
2: Plants characterize a vast natural supply of appreciated compounds that might achieve primary importance for the expansion of novel drugs [ 29].
3: The survey of the effectiveness of plant-based remedies used in the folk medicine has given great reflections because they are cheap and have reduced side effects.
0: According to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 80% of the world population still relies mainly on plant-based drugs [ 30], thus lowering at the same time the impact of self-medication side effects [ 6].
1: The data in biomedical literature presenting plants with medicinal capabilities are very similar to the array of publications depicting the modulatory effects certain ones have over pain perception.
0: The Lamiaceae family, one of the most important herbal families, incorporates a wide variety of plants with biological and medical applications.
1: The most known members of this family are a variety of aromatic spices like thyme, mint, oregano, basil, sage, savory, rosemary, self-heal, hyssop, lemon balm, and some others with more limited use [ 31].
0: Our main objective was to perform a review of this literature for the specific implications of Lamiaceae family plants in pain modulation and thus aid the constant search for new potential agents of natural origin with analgesic effects.
0: The search strategy employed in this review includes internationally accepted databases, namely, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed, using specific keywords of both whole plant products and plant extracts, pain, and analgesic and antinociceptive effects.
1: For investigation, a combination of keywords was used [pain; analgesic; antinociceptive; plant extract] + [ Betonica officinalis;  Glechoma hederacea;  Hyptis pectinata;  Lavandula;  Leonurus cardiaca;  Lamium;  Melissa officinalis;  Mentha;  Marrubium vulgare;  Origanum;  Ocimum;  Rosmarinus officinalis;  Salvia; Satureja hortensis;  Stachys lavandulifolia;  Scutellaria lateriflora;  Sideritis;  Teucrium;  Thymus;  Ziziphora tenuior] + [Lamiaceae; botanical genus].
2: Case reports, case studies,  in vivo and  in vitro relevant studies, and comparative studies were included in this search strategy.
3: Additionally, text books and potentially relevant reviews were explored and included in the reference list.
4: The literature search was confined to the period between 2003 and December 2017.
5: Several articles before 2000 were also included in order to point out the universal interest in natural products with potential applicability in therapy.
6: The dynamic character of the field is reflected in the number of recent publications.
7: For example, a search with the keywords Lamiaceae family and pain in ScienceDirect yields 152 titles in 2015, 111 in 2016, and 129 in 2017, and 23 papers will be published in the first months of the next year ( Figure 1).
0: Introduction
0: House dust mites (HDMs), such as  Dermatophagoides farinae and  D.  pteronyssinus, are an important source of atopic dermatitis, perennial rhinitis, and asthma, with more than a million people at risk in the world 1.
1: HDMs, mainly inhabit the house, apartment, and workplace 1,  2.
2: Changes in housing lifestyle, such as individual households in flats, together with carpets and central installed heating, have increased the conditions for the multiplication of  D.  farinae and  D.  pteronyssinus3.
3: In addition, HDM allergy is also caused by mite faecal pellets, eggs, and dead mite bodies, making it difficult to control mites from the indoor environment 4.
4: Control of  D.  farinae and  D.  pteronyssinus has been conducted by chemical or physical methods 5.
5: Synthetic acaricides are most commonly used, and include chemical agents containing benzyl benzoate, dibutyl phthalate  N, N-diethyl- m-toluamide (DEET) and pyrethroids 6.
6: Although these acaricides are effective, misuse of synthetic acaricides has led to serious drawbacks, including acaricidal resistance, toxicity of human and animals, and environmental hazards 7.
7: In recent years, the development of natural insecticides derived from plants and microbes is required to overcome these drawbacks.
8: Plant-derived products (e.g.
9: 2-isopropyl-5-methylphenol and geraniol) that have wide bioactivity against hygienic insect pests and harmful insects have been researched as alternatives to existing insecticides 8,  9.
0: Melissa officinalis L. is a well-known medicinal plant that is widely cultivated throughout Europe 10.
1: Because it has lemon-like flavor and fragrance,  M.  officinalis is commonly referred to as Lemon Balm 11.
2: M.  officinalis oil was evaluated by antifungal, antibacterial, and antioxidant agents, and is applied to many areas of the cosmetic, food, medicine, and perfume industries 10,  12.
3: The chemical composition of  M.  officinalis oils cultivated in different countries has been investigated by many researchers 13,  14.
4: Patora  et al.
5: 13 reported that  M.  officinalis oil cultivated in Poland is characterized by a high content of -caryophyllene oxide.
6: Moreover, Basta  et al.
7: 14 reported that the major constituent of  M.  officinalis oil cultivated in Greece was caryophyllene oxide, while other predominant constituents were ( E)-caryophyllene, sabinene and -pinene.
0: To the best of our knowledge, no reports are available on acaricidal toxicities and the color deformation effects of  M.  officinalis oils cultivated in France, Ireland, and Serbia against  D.  farinae and  D.  pteronyssinus.
1: Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the chemical composition of the essential oils of  M.  officinalis cultivated in France, Ireland, and Serbia, and to evaluate their acaricidal and color deformation properties against  D.  farinae and  D.  pteronyssinus.
2: We further tested spray formulations containing 0.25, 0.5, and 1%  M.  officinalis oil cultivated in France and its main compound, to investigate the most effective formulations for use as a future acaricide and mite indicator.
0: Introduction
0: In aquaculture diseases such as bacterial and viral infections are controlled using antibiotics and other chemotherapeutics that also promote the growth performance ( Sasmal et al., 2005), and therefore, ensure the animal welfare, but some of these substances have deleterious effect on animals, fish, and humans.
1: Some natural plant origin products like vegetables, herbs, spices, edible plants, and their extracts are not explained as traditional feed additives for animal nutrition.
2: This plant derivates that act as growth promoters, immunostimulants or antimicrobial agents, represents viable and alternative to the use of antibiotics and other chemotherapeutics which are not harmful for environment and which have fewer side effect then chemical drugs ( Galindo-Villegas and Hosokawa, 2004).
0: The effect of herbal products on different species of fish was studied in several previous researches ( Alishahi et al., 2011;  Tangestani et al., 2011;  Asadi et al., 2012;  Haghighi and Sharif Rohani, 2013).
0: Johnson and Banerji (2007) showed that herbal extract as an additive promotes hematological and biochemical performance, enhances the fish growth, and also protects from the diseases.
1: However, studies related to pomegranate application in fish are scanty.
0: Pomegranate ( Punica granatum) is an edible fruit belonging to the family of Punicaceae, native of Iran and widely cultivated in many countries.
1: All anatomical parts of this fruit (seed, flower, juice, peel, leaf, bark, and root) possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer and anti-angiogenesis properties ( Seeram et al., 2006).
2: For this reason pomegranate has largely been used as a natural remedy against different pathological conditions (microbial infections, acidosis, dysentery, diarrhea, hemorrhage, and respiratory diseases) ( Kim and Choi, 2009).
0: High levels of antioxidant are contained in pomegranate juice, peel, and seed oil ( Schubert et al., 1999;  Noda et al., 2002;  Singh et al., 2002) and they represent potential candidates as a nutritional supplement for animals feed such as polyunsaturated oil called punicic acid (an omega 5 fatty acid) which has strong anti-inflammatory properties, for this it reason it is widely used in medicine and cosmetic ( Wang et al., 2004;  Boussetta et al., 2009).
0: In this research pomegranate seed oil (PSO), administered at different rates, was used as feed additive in diets of Rainbow Trout  Onchorhynchus mykiss, that is a species farmed in aquaculture both for food and sports in Europe and one of the most valuable fish in world ( Satari et al., 2007).
0: This study designed to determine the effects of PSO, which has not been investigated as a feed additives for rainbow trout on growth performance, hematological and biochemical values and resistance to  Yersinia ruckeri infection.
0: Ethics Statement
0: All the experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with the ethical considerations presented by the European legislation concerning the protection of animals used for scientific purposes (European Directive 2010/63).
1: This study was approved by the local ethics committee for animal experiments of Canakkale Onsekiz Mart University, Canakkale, Turkey (Approval No.
2: 2016/05-04).

0: Introduction
0: The rapid development of nanotechnology has exposed man and his environment to a number of exotic metals.
1: In the recent years, overgrowing nanotechnology industries have led to the large-scale production of engineered nanoparticles (NPs), especially the metal NPs, for various uses [ 1].
2: Nanoparticles are defined as particles with a diameter of less than 100 nm in one structural dimension.
3: Compared to the same materials with micrometer scale dimensions, nanomaterials have specific properties, such as small size, large surface area, shape, and special structure [ 2].
0: NPs of many different metal oxides are currently being used in numerous applications, we give as examples: magnetic resonance imaging, drug delivery, electronics, catalysis, optical devices [ [3],  [4]]; as well as consumer products like cosmetics, sunscreens, sports accessories, inks and pigments, etc.
1: [ 5].
2: Due to the growing number of applications and the recent development of combustion-based engine transportation [ 6], there is an increasing risk for human, environment and exposure to NPs.
3: Their potential toxicological impacts are still a matter of investigation and our actual knowledge on the effects of nano-sized contaminants on biological systems remains incomplete [ 7].
4: Their use also (which is still largely unregulated) has become a recognized social health problem because the inhalation, dermal absorption or ingestion of particles of various sizes and compositions leads to increased rates of chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases [ 8].
0: Nickel oxide nanoparticales (NiO NPs) have attracted increasing attention owing to potential use in a variety of applications such as catalysts, solar cells, light-emitting diodes, lithium-ion batteries, resistive random access memory, electrochemical sensors and biosensors [ 9].
1: Therefore, increasing use of NiO NPs necessitates an improved understanding of their potential impact on the environment and human health.
2: Besides, toxic effects of NiO NPs have been investigated in different human cell systems, mainly on liver and airway cells [ 10].
0: Oxidative stress, which is an imbalance between ROS (reactive oxygen species) production and the antioxidant systems favoring a ROS excess, has been identified as a common mechanism for cell damage.
1: This imbalance can be amplified by aging, smoking, diseases and some kinds of food [ 11].
2: During oxidative stress, ROS are produced mainly from the mitochondrial electron transport chain.
3: In addition, nanoparticles have been demonstrated to generate more free radicals and reactive oxygen species than larger particles, likely due to their higher surface area [ 12].
4: The inverse correlation between cell viabilities and the ROS level proved that oxidative stress is probably a key route by which nanoparticles induce cytotoxicity [ 11].
0: In recent years, focus on plant research has increased all over the world.
1: Many plant extracts have demonstrated potent chemo-preventive properties; most of these extracts are known to exert their effects via antioxidant mechanisms either by quenching reactive oxygen species (ROS), inhibiting lipid peroxidation or by stimulating cellular antioxidant defenses [ [13],  [14]].
0: Pistacia lentiscus L. also known as mastic tree, belongs to the family Anacardiaceae which consisting of more than eleven species [ 15].
1: It is largely distributed in the Mediterranean region ecosystems where it grows wild in Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Turkey, France, Spain, Italy and Greece [ 16].
2: Despite its limited distribution in the world, this plant is known internationally for several therapeutic properties.

4: According to Ali-Shtayeh et al.
5: (1998) the leaves are extensively used in traditional medicine for the treatment of eczema, diarrhea, and throat infections, and as a potent antiulcer agent [ 18].
6: Several studies have also reported that essential oil from aerial parts possesses appreciable biological properties such as antioxidant [ [19],  [20]], anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial [ 19], anti-fungal [ 21], and antiatherogenic [ 22].
0: Thus, this study was designed to evaluate the antioxidant activity of PLEO using  in vitro tests complemented with a study of their cytoprotective activity against NiO NPs induced oxidative stress in human cell culture.
1: To our knowledge, this is the first investigation using essential oil to reduce NPs inducing cytotoxicity.

1: Introduction
0: Hydroxyapatite (HAp) is a calcium phosphate compound and the best known biomaterial in terms of its morphological and compositional similarity with human hard tissue.
1: From a thermodynamic point of view, hydroxyapatite is the most stable calcium phosphate with regard to the physiological conditions of the human body, including temperature, body fluids composition and human pH.
2: The outstanding properties of HAp nanopowders, such as their biocompatibility, bioactivity, osteoconductivity and nontoxicity, have been demonstrated [ 1].
0: Hydroxyapatite inorganic components (Ca 10(PO 4) 6(OH) 2) resemble, in the most favorable way, the natural biological apatite found in bone.
1: Therefore, it is of interest in medicine and biomedical engineering for bone regeneration and dental applications.
2: As a result of its biocompatibility, hydroxyapatite can be used for coating metal prostheses or dental implants, which is favorable for a successful osteointegration process.
3: On the other hand, it is well known that the risk of postoperative infections [ 2, 3, 4] can be drastically reduced by incorporating antibacterial agents in the chemical structure of hydroxyapatite.
0: Essential oils are complex biostructures, and contain a lot of chemical compounds from different chemical classes: terpenoids, ketones, aldehydes, and esters, either saturated or with different levels of unsaturation, their chemical composition depending on the plants origin and quality, harvest time, climate, soil and especially extraction process [ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
1: About 90% of the bioactive components of EOs are monoterpenes.
2: In oxygenated form, the chemical constituents of EOs exhibit a better bioactivity.
0: Essential oils have been used since ancient times.
1: Over the years, EOs have been approved for use in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, perfumery and food and medicine industries, and are some of the most commonly used natural products.
2: On the other hand, aromatherapy, a branch of alternative medicine, argues that essential oils can be particularly active healing remedies with specific actions for various maladies.
3: Moreover, they can be a natural alternative to synthetic drugs, which produce countless side effects.
4: Today, by combining science with ancient wisdom, we can gain a deeper understanding of and, at the same time, access to the therapeutic benefits that essential oils possess [ 8].
5: The essential oils of basil and lavender are among the best known because of their applicability in various fields of activity.
6: Lavender EOs contains volatile molecules of particular interest to the cosmetics industry, perfumes and aromatherapy, while basil EOs are commonly used in the food industry.
0: In recent years, because of the excessive use of antibiotics, bacteria and viruses are becoming more resistant to drugs.
1: On the other hand, viruses and bacteria have changed a lot over time, and antibiotics cannot treat most of the diseases they cause.
2: Even if bacteria adapt and become resistant to antibiotics, medical and pharmaceutical specialists are trying to find new products that can be used to develop medicines to fight back against pathogens.
3: More than that, chemically synthetized drugs present a certain toxicity and involve a potential risk to humans.
4: In this context, researchers are continuously trying to find new molecules to fight against bacterial strains.
0: Recent studies in this field [ 8] have shown that essential oils are encouraging for use in medicine and biomedical applications due to their antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral properties and their ability to prevent the growth of different pathogens.
1: Lavender oil chemical components were proved to be inhibitors of  M. smegmatis and  E. coli microorganisms [ 8].
2: Basil oils ( Ocimum basilicum) exhibit antibacterial activity against  Brochothrix thermosphacta,  E. coli,  L. innocua,  L. monocytogenes,  P. putida,  S. typhimurium,  S. putrefaciens and  M. flavus microorganisms [ 8].
0: In this context, the results presented in this paper evidence the physicochemical properties and antibacterial activities of hydroxyapatite-lavender essential oil (HAp-L) and hydroxyapatite-basil essential oil (HAp-B) nanocomposites.
1: The morphology of the surfaces of the hydroxyapatite nanoparticles coated with essential oils was analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM).
2: The influence of the basil and lavender essential oils on the molecular structure of the HAp was investigated using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy measurements.
3: The antibacterial effect of hydroxyapatite coated with basil (HAp-B) and lavender (HAp-L) essential oil nanopowders (pressed into pellets) against Gram-positive (MRSA,  S. aureus) and Gram-negative ( E. coli) bacteria was also studied.
0: The plant EOs used in this study were lavender oil, naturally obtained from  Lavandula angustifolia L. (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and basil oil, linalol type, obtained from  Ocimum basilicum L. (Sigma Aldrich).
1: The essential oils were used as purchased without any dilution.
0: The Ca 10(PO 4) 6(OH) 2 hydroxyapatite powders (HAp) were synthesized by an adapted coprecipitation method maintaining the molar ratio Ca:P = 1:67 [ 9] and using as precursors calcium nitrate (Ca(NO 3) 24H 2O, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), ammonium hydrogen phosphate ((NH 4) 2HPO 4; Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., Richmond, VA, USA), ammonium hydroxide (NH 4OH, Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., Richmond, VA, USA), and double distilled water.
1: Ca(NO 3) 24H 2O and (NH 4) 2HPO 4 were dissolved in deionized water and stirred vigorously for 2 h. The solution containing P was then added dropwise into the Ca-containing solution, and the new obtained mixture was magnetically stirred for 2 h at a temperature of 100 C. During the reaction, the pH value was constantly kept at 10.
2: The final product was washed with deionized water several times.
3: The obtained material (HAp) was dried for 48 h at 100 C. The HAp-B and HAp-L samples were obtained by mixing HAp powder with basil and lavender essential oil.
4: HAp, HAp-B and HAp-L powders were pressed into pellets with a diameter of 6 mm.
0: The morphology of the samples was investigated by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) using a HITACHI S4500 microscope (Hitachi, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).
1: Prior to recording the images, the powder samples were evenly dispersed in a specimen holder using as double coated conductive carbon tape conductive adhesive.
2: The sample holder containing the samples was introduced into the vacuum chamber, and all SEM images were recorded using a 5 kV electron acceleration voltage and an Everhart-Thornley detector (ETD).
3: The 3D surface plots of the SEM images were obtained using Image J software (ImageJ 1.51j8, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) [ 10].
0: The specific surface area (S BET) cumulative pore volume (V p) and diameter of the pores (D p) of the HAp, HAp-B, HAp-L samples were determined using an ASAP 2020 instrument from the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm.
1: The measurements were performed at 77 K. The specific surface areas of the HAp, HAp-B, and HAp-L samples were determined by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method [ 11].
2: The total pore volume (V P) and pore size (D P) were calculated using the Barrett, Joyner, and Halenda (BJH) method [ 12].
0: The spectra of HAp-B and HAp-L samples were acquired using a Perkin Elmer spectrometer (Waltham, MS, USA) SP 100 equipped with an Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR) accessory, in the spectral range of 4004000 cm 1 with a 4 cm 1 resolution.
1: The samples were placed on the ATR accessory without any preparation.
2: The background spectrum was acquired in air and taken as reference background spectrum.
3: Before and after the spectral analysis of each sample, the ATR diamond crystal was cleaned with an isopropyl alcohol solution.
4: The ATR plate cleaning was verified by recording the background spectrum after each sample measurement and comparing it with the reference background spectrum.
5: The acquired transmission IR spectra were transformed into absorption spectra according to the A = log (1/T) using the Perkin Elmer spectrometer, SPECTRUM software (Version 6.4.1, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MS, USA).
6: The fine structure of the obtained absorption spectra of the HAp, HAp-B, and HAp-L samples was revealed by peak fitting analysis.
7: The first step performed in the peak fitting analysis procedure was the baseline correction of the experimental infrared spectrum, followed by the second-order derivative calculation for peak wavenumbers finding.
8: Secondly, during the fitting analysis process, a Lorentz-type profile curve was used for each identified peak.
9: A sum of all the Lorentz fitted curves was generated by multiple iteration of the nonlinear least-squares data-fitting algorithm of the calculation software.
10: If the sum of all the fitted curves is set correctly, the algorithm gives a valid and convergent solution.
11: The theoretical curve obtained as a result of peak fitting analysis versus experimental IR curve was presented and analysed [ 13, 14].
0: The tested microorganism strains that were used in this study were Gram-positive bacteria methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and  Staphylococcus aureus 0364 ( S. aureus 0364) and Gram-negative bacteria  Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, ( E. coli ATCC 25922).
1: The qualitative antibacterial assays were performed using microbial suspensions obtained from 1518 h solid cultures on tryptone soy agar (TSA).
2: The cultures were then transferred to fresh Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA) and incubated for 23 h to reach the exponential growth phase.
3: The bacterial suspensions were adjusted to 0.5 McFarland standard (1  10 8 CFU/mL) and were spread on Mueller-Hinton agar plates evenly using a sterile swab.
4: Hydroxyapatite, and hydroxyapatite coated with lavender and basil EOs pellets were placed directly, aseptically and distinctively onto the previously inoculated MHA plates.
5: Agar plates were incubated at 37 C for 1824 h and the inhibition zones formed were measured in mm [ 15, 16].
6: The quantitative studies regarding the antibacterial activity of the HAp, HAp-B and HAp-L powders were performed by microdilution broth method in 96 multi-well plates [ 17, 18, 19].
7: The materials were solubilized in DMSO and two-fold dilutions of the samples ranging from 5 to 0.01 mg/mL were carried out in Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB).
8: Each tube was inoculated with microbial suspension adjusted to 0.5 McFarland and a volume of 100 L of each sample dissolved in DMSO as described above were added to the first well and a serial two-fold dilution was performed.
9: After incubation at 37 C for 1824 h, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values were determined by measuring the absorbance of the microbial suspensions at 620 nm.
0: Background
0: Valerian ( Valeriana officinalis L.
1: s.l.)
2: is an herbaceous perennial plant with a huge variability regarding habitus, composition of ingredients, and agro-economic traits.
3: The leaves usually are imparipinnate, and the leaflets, weakly to strongly serrated.
4: For blooming, a vernalization is necessary and hence, the first inflorescence usually develops in the second year of cultivation.
5: Valerian occurs on sporadically wet habitats in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere.
6: This indicates that a secure water supply is necessary for cultivation.
7: Usually, the rootstock forms a dense meshwork of thin roots [ 1].
0: For medicinal purposes, the entire root system including the rhizome is used [ 2].
1: Preparations based on valerian roots are used against restlessness and sleep disturbances [ 3].
2: In Germany, the dried root of valerian is a component of about 86 phytopharmaceutical and homeopathic preparations.
3: In North America (USA, Canada, Mexico), due to other admission procedures, more than 1000 products with valerian root are obtainable.
4: In Germany alone, the demand for dried roots amounts to app.
5: 1000 tons, equal to a market size of app.
6: 4 Mio.
7: [ 4 8].
0: To counteract the losses of root mass and secondary compounds during harvesting, cleaning and the further production process of dried valerian roots, breeding was started in 2008 to develop new varieties of valerian with a coarser root-system (thicker adventitious roots) and with high contents of secondary compounds.
1: A coarser root system would probably preserve the secondary compounds, essential oil and valerenic acid [ 9].
2: According to the European Pharmacopoeia, the minimum content of essential oil must be 4 ml  kg 1 and of valerenic acid at 0.17% (m/m) [ 2].
3: The most frequent major constituents of essential oil of  Valeriana officinalis L. s.l.
4: are the monoterpenes borneol and its esters, bornyl acetate and bornyl isovalerate [ 10 15].
0: In contrast to the abundant analyses of pharmaceutical secondary compounds and their medicinal values, there are relatively few studies related to the physiology and localization within the root.
1: Zacharias [ 16] described essential oil to be located in [...] the outer exodermis [...], whereas Tschirch and Oesterle [ 17] found it in the [...] single-row hypodermis [...].
2: Both authors described one oil droplet in a single exodermis cell.
3: Localization of essential oil only in the outer cell layers of the valerian roots would support the two following observations made during the breeding of coarse valerian: (i) Considering 200 selected plants (elites), the essential oil content decreased with the increase of root thickness [ 18].
4: This behavior is explainable, because with increasing root diameter, the root surface area decreases in relation to the root volume (calculated as cylinder).
5: (ii) After careful hand-harvesting and hand-processing, high essential oil contents were achieved [ 19].
6: Due to careful handling, the surface was not damaged and the essential oil, close to the root surface, still present.
7: The presence of essential oil close to the root surface was confirmed by Holzner-Lendbrandl [ 20] und Fridvalszky [ 21], who additionally recognized small round bodies named oil sacs in the parenchyma of the roots.
8: These oil sacs were found predominantly in the outer parenchyma.
9: Violon et al.
10: [ 22] identified oil droplets also in the inner parenchyma.
11: All previous investigations remain vague about the oil droplet identification and distribution across the cross-section.
12: In addition, they do not give information concerning oil droplets among different varieties, at different root diameters on the same plant, or at different positions along the roots.
0: The application of various vibrational spectroscopy methods for visualizing secondary metabolites in different plant tissue is already described for e.g.
1: polyacetylenes and carotenoids in carrots, or essential oil components in fennel, chamomile and curcuma [ 23 28].
2: The Fourier-transform infrared FITR imaging method allows one to study the occurrence and distribution of a wide range of molecules in cell tissues.
3: However, it has not yet been applied for the essential oil in valerian.
4: The fluorescence-microscopic method is suitable for the visualization and localization of secondary compounds in plant roots, and was used with sunflowers and mountain arnica [ 29 31].
5: Furthermore, a spectral-sensitive camera could make more oil droplet structures visible, or make chemical differentiation possible, respectively [ 32,  33].
0: Our intention was to give a more detailed histochemical description within the valerian roots.
1: The development of an appropriate method to visualize and clearly identify the essential oil droplets required several consecutive steps grouped into two fields: (k) Verification of oil droplets and (kk) generation of an essential oil distribution map.
2: Verification of the oil droplets (k) was done by light-microscopic imaging and subsequent confirmation of the essential oil in the found oil droplets by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) imaging.
3: Based on the results of these investigations, fluorescence-microscopic imaging for generating oil droplet maps (kk) could be applied.
0: Based on this, the study at hand was carried out to better understand the histochemical background of the two observations (i) and (ii).
1: Observation (i) must be well interpreted to assess the achievability of the breeding target of a thick root-system with good essential oil content.
2: Understanding the histological background of observation (ii) may explain why the entire essential oil is not all lost during a more robust, mechanized root harvesting and processing in large-scale valerian field production.
3: We postulated that a great part of the essential oil droplets occur in the inner parts of the valerian root.
0: Introduction
0: The recent years witnessed, in poultry, a growing interest in wide ranges of natural products and plant extracts, especially about their positive effects on reproduction and fertility outputs [ 1- 3].
1: Essential oils, when used particularly  in vivo as dietary supplementation, showed a remarkable potency in protecting and improving sperm parameters of several animal species [ 4- 7].
2: However, when used  in vitro, in humans as well in other animal species, essential evidenced spermicidal effects with impacts on gametes motility and plasma membrane integrity [ 8- 12].
0: Rosmarinus officinalis is known as a rich source of polyphenols and volatile oils including molecules such as carnosic, rosmarinic acids, and camphor [ 13- 16].
1: These compounds display diverse biological activities including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties.
2: In aged roosters, Borghei-Rad  et al.
3: [ 17] reported that dietary supplementation with rosemary leaves powder improved significantly semen quality, fertility, and hatchability through fighting oxidative stress damages.
4: Similarly, dietary supplementation using other antioxidants, including Vitamin E, selenium, Vitamin C, and enzymatic antioxidant systems, improved significantly animal health and sperm quality [ 18- 21].
0: Sperm cells are known to be more vulnerable to reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated during oxidative stress, than somatic cells due to gametes cell structure and their limited contents of antioxidants.
1: In this respect, the phospholipidic fraction of spermatozoa cell membranes [ 22] is the first target of ROS with negative effects on membrane fluidity and the subsequent impairment of motility, acrosome reaction, and sperm-egg interaction [ 23, 24].
2: Accordingly, high membrane concentration in PUFA makes sperm cells more susceptible to lipid peroxidation, especially, during the different stages of  in vitro storage at low temperatures compromising, thus fertility outputs [ 24, 25].
0: In fact, in rooster, artificial insemination (AI) is routinely carried out after short-term storage at 4C; however, reports evidenced that fertilizing capacity of freshly collected semen is dramatically lost after half an hour of collection [ 22].
1: Therefore, development of optimal semen extenders, including different active compounds, was considered worldwide by different research groups to protect sperm cells against motility damages.
2: The adopted strategies consisted essentially of protecting cell membrane against cold shock and oxidative stress [ 26, 27].
0: In this respect, numerous studies, using rosemary leaves extract, containing rich fractions of polyphenols, have reported positive effects on frozen semen in several species including boar [ 28], dog [ 29], and ram [ 30].
1: However, no protective effect was reported when using  R. officinalis essential oil, and recently, Elmi  et al.
2: [ 31] observed similar motilities when comparing the control to sperm treated  in vitro with 0.2 mg/ml of  R. officinalis essential oil.
3: Overall, all the reported data independently on the considered plant showed an obvious spermicidal activity.
0: Thus, to the best of our knowledge, no previous records reported the usefulness of essential oils as protective factors during semen preservation at low temperatures.
1: This study aimed to investigate the interest of  R. officinalis essential oil in the preservation of rooster sperm motility during 4C short-term storage.
0: Introduction
0: Fusarium graminearum [telemorph Gibberella zeae (Schwein)] is a sporadic plant pathogen, causes Fusarium head blight (FHB) in barley and wheat, stalk rot and Gibberella ear rot in maize, and one of the utmost liable for economic setback in the agriculture and food industry worldwide ( Dweba et al., 2017).
1: F. graminearum infestation of agriculture commodities fetches the rancidity along with the loss in grain yield and quality, including texture, color, odor, and nutrition ( Morgavi et al., 2007;  Okeke et al., 2015).
2: As well,  F. graminearum is a prominent producer of hazardous Fusarium mycotoxins, including deoxynivalenol (DON), nivalenol (NIV), and zearalenone (ZEA), which were reported to cause deleterious health issues in the farm animals and humans, such as nephrotoxic, immunotoxic, neurotoxic, hepatotoxic, genotoxic, reproductive, and developmental defects ( Morgavi et al., 2007;  Venkataramana et al., 2014;  Kalagatur et al., 2017).
3: Besides, International Agency on Research and Cancer (IARC) has confirmed the carcinogenicity of Fusarium mycotoxins and classified into group 3 agents ( IARC, 1999).
4: Concerning these worries, the European Union (EU), Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), and various nations have recommended stringent regulatory levels for Fusarium mycotoxins in agricultural and food products ( JECFA, 2000;  European Commission, 2007).
0: Regrettably,  F. graminearum and its risky toxins are coherent contaminants of wide range of agricultural commodities worldwide ( Richard et al., 2003;  Pasquali et al., 2016;  Tralamazza et al., 2016;  Ok et al., 2018).
1: Recently,  Beccari et al.
2: (2018) have detected the higher incidence of FHB in Durum wheat samples of central Italy and reported that 22% fungal species were  F. graminearum.
3: In Mediterranean countries of Europe,  Gorczyca et al.
4: (2018) have detected yield loss and contamination of mycotoxins in Durum wheat owed to FHB incidence.
5: In the same way,  Vogelgsang et al.
6: (2017) in Switzerland haev surveyed the incidence of DON and ZEA between 2007 and 2014 in wheat and noticed an overall mean concentration of 607 g/kg of DON and 39 g/kg of ZEA.
7: Intolerably, 11% and 7% of wheat samples were surpassed the EU regulatory limits of DON and ZEA, respectively, and found unfit for consumption.
8: Similarly,  Mallmann et al.
9: (2017) during 20082015 in Brazil have measured the prevalence of FHB and detected 73% and 38% of wheat samples, 67% and 41% of barley samples were contaminated with DON and ZEA, respectively.
10: Furthermore,  Kos et al.
11: (2017) in Serbia have noticed 260.11388, 260.49050, and 252.36280 g/kg of DON in maize samples during 2013, 2014, and 2015, respectively.
12: Likewise,  Mudili et al.
13: (2014) and  Ramana et al.
14: (2011) too enlightened the prevalence of  F. graminearum in rice, finger millet, and maize grains originated from Southern region of India and perceived 7294 g/kg of DON attendance in freshly harvested maize grains.
0: The status quo apprehensions the insistent incidence of  F. graminearum and its toxins in agricultural commodities, and demand effective approaches from microbiologists and food technologists to overcome these problems in agriculture and food industry.
1: However, the application of synthetic fungicides has not been acceptable because of increasing concern on multiple drug resistance, environmental safety, and deleterious health issues in humans and animals.
2: Over the last decade, plant-originated mycobiocides, exclusively essential oils have attained a considerable attention as of its non-toxic and eco-friendly ( Hyldgaard et al., 2012;  Kalagatur et al., 2015;  George et al., 2016;  Iram et al., 2016;  Kumar et al., 2016;  Vanhoutte et al., 2016;  Muniyandi et al., 2017).
3: In recent times, nanotechnology has provided great assistance to improve the microbiological safety of food and feed matrices.
4: Particularly, nanomaterials of chitosan were found eco-friendly and safe, and their application in food is highly satisfactory by consumer, food industry, and regulatory agencies ( Yeung et al., 2016;  Niaz et al., 2017;  Siddaiah et al., 2018).
5: Furthermore, essential oils are volatile and lose their stability and bio-functional features on exposure to temperature, light, pH, moisture, and oxygen ( Jamil et al., 2016).
6: In this context, the encapsulation of essential oils with chitosan by nanotechnology approach was recognized as a finest approach to safeguard the stability and bio-functional features of essential oils ( Barreto et al., 2016;  Yeung et al., 2016).
0: In this context, essential oil obtained from leaves of  Cymbopogon martinii was encapsulated with chitosan and used for reduction of growth and mycotoxins of  F. graminearum.
1: The  C. martinii also known as Indian geranium, motia, and rosha, is a tropical herbaceous grass belong to family Poaceae and extensively distributed subtropical parts of Africa, America, and Asia ( Duke, 1993).
2: This plant is a native of India and grows as wild and irrigated crop in Western Ghats found among the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, and in some parts of North Eastern India ( Rao, 2001;  Gupta et al., 2015).
3: The aerial parts of plant such as leaf, stem, and inflorescence are considered as decent sources for essential oil and profoundly rich in bioactive chemical constituents like caryophyllene, geraniol, geranyl acetate, linalool, myrcene, limonene, humulene, selinenes, etc.
4: ( Rao et al., 2005;  Cannon et al., 2013;  Verma et al., 2013;  Kakaraparthi et al., 2015).
5: C. martinii essential oil (CMEO) is considered as non-toxic, non-sensitizing and non-irritant, and not reported for any deleterious health effects and recognized as Generally Regarded as Safe (GRAS) by the US Food and Drug Administration, and extensively used as antimicrobial, antihelmintic, cosmetic, toiletry, pharmaceutical, preservative, stress revealer, convalescence, insect, and mosquito repellents, and also as an ingredient in herbal tea, non-alcoholic beverages, flavor in tobacco products, traditional and baked foods, and all these features reflect the potency of CMEO in essential oil industry ( Kumar et al., 2007;  Tsai et al., 2011;  Gupta et al., 2015).
0: In the present study, CMEO was extracted from leaves by hydrodistillation technique and chemical profile was determined by GC-MS analysis.
1: The antifungal activity of CMEO on  F. graminearum was determined in terms of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) by micro-well dilution method, and further, it was confirmed by scanning electron microscopic (SEM) observation of macroconidia.
2: The antifungal mechanism of CMEO was revealed by determining the content of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation, and ergosterol.
3: The chitosan encapsulated CMEO nanoparticles (Ce-CMEO-NPs) were prepared by emulsification technique and characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), SEM, Zeta potential and size, and  in vitro release of essential oil.
4: Finally,  in vitro antifungal and antimycotoxin activities of CMEO and Ce-CMEO-NPs on  F. graminearum were comparatively evaluated in maize grains.
0: Introduction
0: Fungal pathosis caused by different  Candida species results in localized and/or systemic lesions.
1: In the oral infections, among various strains,  Candida albicans is often found in abundance in the lesions.
2: [ 123] Factors such as imbalanced diet, prolonged usage of broad-spectrum antibiotics, immunosuppressant medications and wearing of an ill-fitting, and poorly maintained oral prosthesis, can promote the conversion of these oral commensals into potential pathogens.
3: Overgrowth of these pathogens on the oral mucous membranes can lead to Candida-associated denture stomatitis (CADS).
4: [ 34]
0: Most antifungal agents currently available for the treatment of CADS have several drawbacks.
1: Some antifungal agents have been found to be toxic on long-term application required to resolve the condition.
2: [ 56] Furthermore, the fungi develop resistance to these drugs due to their inherent adaptive qualities such as formation of biofilms, expression of different genes, development of efflux pumps, or persistor cells.
3: [ 789101112]
0: Herbal plants have a long history of being used as culinary flavoring agents and as medicines for different ailments in human beings.
1: [ 1314] Several plants have been found to possess antifungal properties against  Candida-related pathosis in the urine, blood, and stools.
2: [ 1516]
0: Origanum vulgare is an herbal plant that has been used as food flavoring agent in many countries [ Figure 1].
1: It has strong antiseptic and antimicrobial activity due to the presence of carvacrol and thymol, both phenolic compounds which directly inhibit germination and hyphal formation in  Candida.
2: Its antifungal actions have been found to be similar to nystatin and amphotericin B.
3: A study in mice has shown to cure systemic candidiasis on a daily oral administration of 1.0 l of  O. vulgare essential oil for 30 days.
4: [ 17] In human beings, the antifungal activities of  O. vulgare have been studied against the  Candida isolated from sources of various systemic conditions.
5: [ 41718] However, no study is available in the literature that has explored its possible anti-candidal activity against oral isolates of  Candida that cause CADS.
0: Hence,  O. vulgare was chosen to characterize its antifungal effects on oral isolates of  Candida from a denture wearer with CADS.
1: The organisms were collected from the patients affected with CADS.
2: The essential oil was extracted from the leaves of the plant, and the antifungal activity was confirmed using well diffusion method against  Candida species.
3: The efficacy of two extraction methods, hydrodistillation and maceration, was compared.
4: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) of the herb were determined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
5: The active functional group in the experimental herb was identified as a compound similar to carvacrol through infrared (IR) spectroscopy method.

1: Introduction
0: Biofilms are organized groups of microorganisms that live inside an extracellular polymer matrix that is self-sustaining and can adhere to various surfaces [ 1], biotic and abiotic [ 2].
1: Biofilms are often observed floating or submerged in liquids [ 3] and can be composed of homogeneous or heterogeneous communities of bacteria within a polymer matrix, which is primarily composed OF polysaccharides as well as other biomolecules, such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids [ 2].
2: Analyses of the polymer matrix have revealed that biofilms are hydrogels that exhibit viscoelastic behavior, allowing them to resist mechanical stresses [ 4].
0: Many biofilms are present in a variety of microbial infections, including dental infections [ 5]; periodontitis [ 6]; lung infections resulting from cystic fibrosis and facial filling [ 7]; chronic wounds [ 8]; ear inflammation [ 9]; implant-associate infections [ 10]; chronic rhinosinusitis [ 11]; contamination in intensive care units (ICU) [ 12]; contact lens infections [ 13]; and human gastrointestinal tract infections [ 14].
1: Studies have shown that  S. aureus is the second most prevalent pathogen in ICUs [ 15] and often causes infections in women, with biofilms formed by this microorganism causing complications in urinary infection treatments [ 16].
0: Biofilms protect microorganisms from external aggression and predator attacks [ 17], and some populations of biofilm-associated bacteria are resistant to antibiotics [ 5].
1: Thus, the increased resistance of bacterial biofilms to antibiotics is problematic for the use of antimicrobial drugs [ 18], driving the search for alternative medicinal plants that can be used to treat diseases [ 19].
2: In particular, it is necessary to identify new drugs that can serve as an alternative treatment of infections caused by microorganisms that are resistant to traditional therapies.
3: One approach is the study of local medicinal plants with possible antimicrobial and antibiofilm properties.
0: Essential oils, which are natural products obtained from plants, contain volatile organic compounds that can be obtained from various parts of the plant, such as flowers, fruits, seeds, stems, AND roots [ 20].
1: These oils have demonstrated antioxidant, insecticidal, antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, and antibiofilm activities [ 21 23].
2: Among essential oils of botanical origin that have antimicrobial potential are those obtained from plant species of the genus  Cinnamomum (Lauraceae), such as  C. zeylanicum and  C. cassia.
0: C. zeylanicum is native to some regions of India and Ceylon; thus, it is known as cinnamon-of-ceylon [ 24].
1: This species has been used in folk medicine due to its many medicinal properties, including its activities as astringent, aphrodisiac, antiseptic, aperitif, aromatic, carminative, digestive, stimulant, hypertensive, sedative, tonic and vasodilator [ 25], antidiabetic, antinociceptive, astringent, and diuretic [ 26].
2: From the different parts of the plant, essential oils with various chemical compositions can be obtained, and essential oil from the stem bark contains up to 4% oil consisting of (E)-cinnamaldehyde (65-78%) and eugenol (4-10%), accompanied by low percentages of cinnamyl acetate, methyl-n-amyl-ketone, and mono- and sesquiterpenoids [ 27].
0: C. cassia, popularly known as cinnamon-china, is a perennial tree native to southern China and is widely cultivated in southern and eastern Asia (Taiwan, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, India, Indonesia, and Malaysia) [ 28].
1: C. cassia is used in Western medicine, primarily in the treatment of diarrhoea, flatulent dyspepsia, cramps, colds, flu, cough, bronchitis, lack of appetite, renal weakness, arthritic angina, palpitations, spasms, vomiting, gastric ulcers, digestive complaints, and bacterial and fungal infections of the skin [ 29].
2: The trunk bark contains at least 1.0% essential oil, consisting of 70 to 90% (E)-cinnamaldehyde [ 30].
3: In addition, a study also reported that the essential oil of this species has antifungal activity against  Candida albicans [ 31].
0: (E)-Cinnamaldehyde, the most abundant component of the essential oils of the  Cinnamomum species mentioned, is a phenylpropanoid that has proven activity against microorganisms [ 32].
1: Due to this already proven antimicrobial action, this work aimed to verify the action of essential oils and cinnamaldehyde against microbial biofilms of clinical interest.

1: Introduction
0: Argan oil extracted from the fruits of  Argania spinosa L. (Sapotaceae) has many nutritional, cosmetic, and therapeutic properties thanks to its richness in unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) and bioactive substances such as tocopherols and phytosterols [ 1].
1: The cosmetic oil is extracted by mechanical press from unroasted almonds.
2: As for the edible oil, it is extracted by press or in the traditional way by hand kneading roasted almonds.
3: Roasting is usually carried out on the wood fire by constantly stirring the almonds until browning.
4: It constitutes an important step in the development of the organoleptic characteristics of the oil, in particular the typical hazelnut aroma appreciated by the consumer.
0: In industry, heating of oilseeds is carried out with the aim of increasing oil extraction yield, reducing seed moisture, and deactivating lipases and lipoxygenases which could induce fatty acids (FA) oxidation [ 2].
1: The oxidation could lead to loss of nutritional value and decreased shelf life [ 3].
2: The roasting of oilseeds could also improve the stability of vegetable oils by increasing the extraction yield of antioxidant substances [ 4,  5].
3: As regards the effect of roasting on the content of tocopherols which represent the major antioxidants of vegetable oils, the data from the literature are inconsistent.
4: Depending on the nature and variety of oilseeds, roasting may lead to a decrease [ 5 7] or an increase in tocopherols level in oil [ 8 10].
5: Since tocopherols are thermosensitive, their final concentration in the oil will depend essentially on the temperature and the duration of the roasting.
0: In the case of argan oil, the literature does not report studies of the impact of roasting on the chemical composition of the oil, with the exception of the study by Harhar et al.
1: [ 11] in which only the duration of the roasting was taken into consideration for a constant temperature of 110C.
2: The objective of this work was to evaluate the concomitant effects of the temperature and the duration of the roasting of the  A. spinosa almonds on the chemical composition of the oil.
3: To do this, the roasting was carried out by combining temperatures of 75, 100, 125, 150, and 175C with times of 10, 20, and 30 min.
4: The chemical composition of the oil related to the content of fatty acids, tocopherols, and phospholipids.
5: The physicochemical parameters considered were acidity, peroxide value (PV), absorbance at 232 nm (K232) and 270 nm (K270), and browning index (assessed by absorbance at 420 nm).
0: Background
0: Garlic ( Allium sativum L.) has been widely used as a foodstuff and, for many centuries, has also been used as a traditional medicine due to its perceived effects in preventing and curing ailments [ 1].
1: China has 33.3 million square meters devoted to cultivating garlic and produces more than 500 million tons of garlic, accounting for 12 of the total area of cultivated garlic in Asia and 1/3 of the total area of cultivated garlic in the world [ 2].
2: Several organosulfur compounds present in garlic oil have been shown to possess numerous biological activities.
3: The four most important organosulfur compounds, considered to be the major biological agents, are diallyl sulfide (DAS), diallyl disulfide (DADS), diallyl trisulfide (DATS) and allylmethyl trisulfide [ 3].
4: A series of biological benefits, such as hypolipidemic and hypocholesterolemic effects [ 4], antioxidant potential [ 5,  6], and antimicrobial activity [ 7], have been reported.
5: The pungent fractions of garlic are mostly sulfur-containing moieties, while its two chemical groups, namely, flavonoids and ALK (EN)-based cysteine sulfoxides (ACSOs), have marked effects on human health [ 8].
0: Onion ( Allium cepa Linn.)
1: is also one of the oldest cultivated plants, with its cultivation dating back to before 5000 BC.
2: World onion production has increased by at least 25% over the past 10 years to the current output of approximately 44 million tons, making it the second most important horticultural crop after tomatoes [ 8].
3: Onion is rich in sulfur-containing compounds and is used as a foodstuff, a flavoring, a condiment and folk medicine.
4: According to traditional Chinese medicine, onions special features are warm and hot tastes, together with functions such as warming the lungs to reduce phlegm, warming the stomach during digestion, detoxifying and destroying intestinal worms, decreasing swelling and soreness, and decreasing blood pressure and blood lipids.
5: As a result, onions are used for expelling worms in children, curing rheumatoid arthritis, treating the swelling and pain associated with athletes foot or dermal ulcers, dysentery, pertussis, insomnia and other conditions [ 9,  10].
6: Onions contain a considerable number of compounds that are highly beneficial for human health and that have been reported to have anti-hyperglycemic and anti-hyperlipidemic effects on diabetic rats [ 11].
7: ACSOs are also some of the active components in onion oil.
8: The main components of onion oil are sulpho compounds, including propane disulfide, disulfide propylene, S-methyl cysteine, and others [ 12].
0: Patients with dyslipidemia are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is the main cause of premature death and has been a major cause of disability and ill health in recent years [ 13,  14].
1: In China, the situation is very serious, and the number of patients with dyslipidemia has reached 160 million, with annual numbers of disability and death originating from dyslipidemia-associated diabetes, stroke, cerebral infarction, hemiplegia, or myocardial infarction also increasing [ 15].
2: As a result, it is important to find reasonable and effective ways to prevent, control, and improve dyslipidemia to provide significant reductions in atherosclerosis and cardio-cerebral vascular diseases.
3: Obesity is one of the most prevalent heath conditions that may foster various diseases, such as dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, hypertension and increased risk of cardiovascular mortality [ 16].
4: There have been few studies concerning the lipid-lowering and anti-obesity properties of garlic oil and onion oil prior to the current study.
5: The objectives of this study were to explore the influence of garlic oil and onion oil on serum lipid levels in dyslipidemia model rats, to provide a scientific basis for the prevention of dyslipidemia through a dietary approach, and to explore the potential health benefits of garlic and onion.
0: Introduction
0: Hongyang kiwifruit ( Actinidia chinensis) is the first international red-fleshed cultivar in Sichuan of China.
1: Due to its unique flavor and abundant nutrients, such as high levels of vitamin C, anthocyanins, dietary fiber, and amino acids, Hongyang kiwifruit has interested consumers ( Lin et al., 2017).
2: China is the leading kiwifruit producing country, and the average level of production topped the list in 20132016 (44.5% of the world production).
3: Kiwifruit is infected by different fungi associated with fruit diseases.
4: For instance, gray mold, caused by  Botrytis cinerea, is one the important postharvest diseases of kiwifruit ( Williamson et al., 2007); Blue mold, caused by  Penicillium expansum, can also cause decay in harvested kiwifruit, although it is not as prevalent as gray mold ( Neri et al., 2010).
5: Especially, the anthracnose of kiwifruit is severe, which can infect leaves, canes, and fruits, resulting in significantly economic losses during storage.
6: However, at present, relevant studies on anthracnose of kiwifruit have seldom been reported.
0: The use of chemically synthetic preservative in controlling food spoilage and pathogenic fungus has been a controversial topic ( Tian et al., 2014).
1: The artificially chemical compounds are considered as chronic and reproductive toxicants causing respiratory diseases or other health risks ( Fleming-Jones and Smith, 2003).
2: In this case, natural preservatives such as essential oil (EO) have been extensively used due to its biodegradable and antimicrobial properties.
3: EO contains a variety of substances called phytochemicals, which belong to natural components in plants ( Pratt, 1992).
4: The phytochemical preparations with dual functionalities in preventing lipid oxidation and antimicrobial properties have tremendous potential for extending shelf life of food products ( Singh et al., 2007;  Fadli et al., 2012).
5: Generally, EO possesses high volatility.
6: When EO is applied as a vapor, less oil is used.
7: Further, the residues of EO on the product are minimized, and there will be less of a problem with tainting ( Szczerbanik et al., 2007).
8: It may be more appropriate to use EO in their vapor phase for postharvest applications ( Concha et al., 1998;  Zollo et al., 1998).
9: Cinnamon ( Cinnamomum zeylanicum or  Cinnamomum verum), rich in EO, belongs to Lauraceae family comprising about 250 species and usually distributes in India, China, Sri Lanka, and Australia ( Prasad et al., 2009).
10: Cinnamon essential oil (CEO) is a promising food preservative for the inhibition of foodborne pathogens and spoilage microorganisms ( Tian et al., 2012).
11: Our previous studies have shown that CEO have good efficacy on preservation of Hongyang kiwifruit.
12: Moreover, Hongyang kiwifruit fumigated with 0.4 L/mL of CEO could be stored at (4  1) C with relative humidity of 9095% for 120 days ( He et al., 2015).
13: CEO has been demonstrated as a strong and broad range of inhibition for bacteria, fungi and yeast ( Chao et al., 2000;  Manso et al., 2015).
14: Our previous studies have demonstrated that CEO have good inhibitory effects against  Botryosphaeria parva in vitro, and can reduce soft rot on Hongyang kiwifruit  in vivo ( He et al., 2015).
15: Antifungal activity of CEO against  C. acutatum isolated from strawberry anthracnose was investigated ( Duduk et al., 2015).
16: Cell plasma membrane (PM) is the action site invaded by antifungal substances, such as silicon and chlorine dioxide ( Wei et al., 2008;  Liu et al., 2010).
17: For fungi, the integrity of PM plays a crucial role in maintaining cell constituents being important to viability, such as sugar, protein and nucleic acid.
18: The soluble sugar, soluble protein and nucleic acid are the basic and functional components in the cell.
19: The PM is damaged, and the intracellular components can be leaked ( Wei et al., 2008;  Kim et al., 2009;  Liu et al., 2010).
20: The antifungal activity of EO was strongly associated with its compositions, such as monoterpenic phenoles, especially thymol, carvacrol, and eugenol ( Barrera-Necha et al., 2008).
21: The antifungal mechanism of EO is speculated to induce membrane disruption by their lipophilic compounds ( Cowan, 1999).
22: The low-molecular-weight and highly lipophilic components of EO pass easily through cell membranes and cause disruption to the fungal cell organization ( Chao et al., 2005;  Shukla et al., 2012).
23: Therefore, in this study, the dominant pathogens, which caused postharvest diseases such as anthracnose in Hongyang kiwifruit, was firstly isolated and identified.
24: Further, the antifungal activity and the possible antifungal mechanism of CEO against  C. acutatum isolated from decayed Hongyang kiwifruit were investigated.
