# Classification of Named Terpene Pathway

**Download the CSV file** [Classifiaction of 30 pathway - Sheet1 (1).csv](https://github.com/petermr/CEVOpen/files/8117068/Classifiaction.of.30.pathway.-.Sheet1.1.csv)


**Refer to the** [**rules**](https://github.com/petermr/CEVOpen/wiki/Rules-for-Classification-of-Named-terpene-pathway)

## Purpose:

To come to a confirmation that whether the extracted images on [wikipathway page](https://gladstone-bioinformatics.shinyapps.io/shiny-terpeneplant/) from various papers, articles, journels etc. consistis of Named Terpene Pathway. 

For this purpose we need various people with any background to annotate the CSV file and we will analyze the database and get the needed confirmation. 

Anyone and Everyone can be an annotator. You don't need to have a biology background. 

## Methodology:

We will be collecting raw data and with the help of statistical analysis based on inter-annotator agreement and correlation coefficient will analyze the annotation and come to a certain conclusion.

## CURRENT STATUS:

We have asked people to annotate the csv file with the help of the rules that we have formulated. Everything could be found at this link, you can download the CSV file and it will also take you to the rules [link](https://github.com/petermr/petermr/discussions/4#discussioncomment-2228717)

## Data Collection: 
If you are a volunteer who wish to contribute your annotations, follow the steps below

[//]: # (### Download the annotation template)

## Regrading Filling of CSV file
You will have four columns to fill, that is **Pathway**, **Metabolic**, **Pre-Terpene**, **Terpene**. Please fill each of these columns with **"yes"** and **"no"**. Please avoid using any upper case letter, alongwith 0's and 1's while filling the CSV file.

## How to perform the task:

1. **Download the CSV file** [Classifiaction of 30 pathway - Sheet1 (1).csv](https://github.com/petermr/CEVOpen/files/8117068/Classifiaction.of.30.pathway.-.Sheet1.1.csv)
2. Edit the CSV file 
   - Click on the link in the link coloumn (will take you to the image).
