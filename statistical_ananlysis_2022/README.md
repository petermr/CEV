## This folder contains codes and materials related to terpene pathway classification task.

In the statistical_ananlysis_2022 folder you will find:
1. **df_generation.py** : script file that generates dataframe from all the annotators csv files for a concrened column name [ex. pathway, terpene]
2. **statiscal_analysis.iypnb**: is an interactive jupyter notebook which computes correlation between annotators based on diffrent metrics. In order to see how we are comparing and analysis annotator's performance. Open the notebook in your google colaboratoty by just clicking on the "open colab" button at the top of the notebook, and then experience our methodoly for the analysis. 
3. The subfolder **example_data** gives a glimse of how the original data will look like.



Inside the example_data folder you can find these folders:
1. **annotators_label** :  which contain samples of annotators label for a random set of images collected from Alex Pico [shiny-terpeneplant](https://gladstone-bioinformatics.shinyapps.io/shiny-terpeneplant/) website.
2. **terpene** : contains statistical analysis performnace of annotators for the column "Trepene".
3. **pathway** : contains statistical analysis performnace of annotators for the column "Pathway".
4. **pre_terpene** : contains statistical analysis performnace of annotators for the column "Pre-Terpene".
5. **metabolic** : contains statistical analysis performnace of annotators for the column "Metabolic".
