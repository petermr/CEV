<p>To test the correlation between the micromorphological features and essential oil yield and composition, correlation tests were performed. Spearman’s correlation test showed a moderate correlation between the corrected FID area and the number of peltate trichomes (r

  <sub>s</sub>
 </italic>= 0.60 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.02), while there was no significant correlation between the corrected FID area and the number of any other type of glandular trichomes or a total number of glandular trichomes, suggesting that peltate trichomes attribute most to the essential oil yield. When the total volume of glandular trichomes was calculated, Spearman’s correlation test showed a slight increase in the correlation coefficient (r

  <sub>s</sub>

 <italic>p</italic> = 0.02). Due to the very different chemical composition of EOs between species, there was no correlation found between the EO profile and glandular trichome type or number.
