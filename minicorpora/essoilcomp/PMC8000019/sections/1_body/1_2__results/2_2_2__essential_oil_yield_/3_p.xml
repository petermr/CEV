<p>The same holds true for the second individual sampled from the coastal area (M2), but here the domination of the monoterpenes was even more pronounced. In this sample, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene was the dominant component in leaves, and thymol the second most abundant. In all other samples, thymol was the dominant, while the second most abundant compound was γ-terpinene. Even though thymol had a high abundance in all EOs, flower EOs had a higher percentage of thymol (39.4–51.7% vs. 25.7–32.0%). The EO profile of this chemotype was much simpler, with only 23 to 34 detected components. The EO from herba had an intermediate composition, with its composition more similar to the flower EOs, especially calyx EO.
