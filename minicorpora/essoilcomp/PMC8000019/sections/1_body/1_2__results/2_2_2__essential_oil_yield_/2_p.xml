<p>The essential oil profiles of studied taxa showed distinctive patterns. In 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> from the continental population (M1), between 44 and 58 compounds were detected in EOs. There were distinctive quantitative differences between EOs from different plant parts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00511-f005">Figure 5</xref>). The EOs in leaves were dominated by monoterpenes, with almost equal parts of monoterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated monoterpenes, while sesquiterpenes and other compounds represented only a small percentage of the total oil. The EO from herba showed a somewhat intermediate composition, positioning itself closer to leaf EO. The leaf EO was dominated by 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, while corolla and calyx EOs had a significantly higher percentage of sesquiterpenes, with geraniol as a dominant component (
