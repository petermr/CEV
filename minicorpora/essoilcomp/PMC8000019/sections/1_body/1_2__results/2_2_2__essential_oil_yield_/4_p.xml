<p>In 
 <italic>S. kitaibelii,</italic> the EO composition of individual plant parts and organs differs not only in the profile but also in its complexity. The EOs from flower parts contained fewer compounds (14 and 20 in corolla and calyx, respectively) in comparison to leaves and herba (60 and 54, respectively). The profiles also differed significantly. The EO from leaves was strongly dominated by monoterpenes, while EOs from flower parts were dominated by oxygenated monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. The herba EO was more similar to leaf EO than flower EOs. Even though linalool was the dominant component in all samples, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene was abundant in EOs from leaves and herba, while (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene and germacrene D were abundant in EOs from flower parts.
