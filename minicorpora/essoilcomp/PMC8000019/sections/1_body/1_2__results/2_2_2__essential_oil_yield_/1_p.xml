<p>Fourteen to 60 compounds were detected in the EO composition, accounting for 90.4 to 99.8% of the total oil (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-10-00511">Table S2</xref>). The EO profiles differed greatly between the studied taxa and used plant part (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00511-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). When comparing EOs obtained from the aboveground plant material (herba), 
 <italic>Satureja montana</italic> and 
 <italic>S. kitaibelii</italic> EOs were strongly dominated by monoterpenes, while EOs of 
 <italic>S. subspicata</italic> subspecies had higher abundances of sesquiterpenes.
