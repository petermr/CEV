<p>Unlike peltate trichomes, capitate C1 and C2 show organ preference. Capitate trichomes (C1) resemble peltate trichomes, with basal and neck cells sunken into the epidermis, but are three times smaller (20 ± 4 μm). This type of glandular trichomes was present on the leaves in all samples, being more numerous on the abaxial leaf side (

 <italic>S. subspicata</italic> subsp.
