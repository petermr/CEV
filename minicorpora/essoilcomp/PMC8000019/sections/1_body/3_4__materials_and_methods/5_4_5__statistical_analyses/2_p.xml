<p>For leaf EOs, the standard deviation and variance were calculated to assess the variability produced by the isolation procedure. In all statistical analyses, the mean values of leaf EOs and abundance of each terpene class were used. The principal component analysis (PCA) and Spearmanâ€™s linear correlation analysis were performed to assess the variability and relationship between data. For the PCA analysis, only components that were present on average above 0.5% and uncorrelated were used.</p>
