<p>Randomly chosen dried leaves, calyces, corollas, and stems were selected from each individual plant. They were coated with a thin layer of gold (ion sputtering coating) in the BAL-TEC SCD 005 Sputtering Device and observations were carried out on a JEOL JSM-6460LV electron microscope at 20 kV SEM. All micrographs were taken with a calibration scale at magnification 200 × 100 μm and then all trichomes were counted using the Digimizer software 4.3.5 (2005–2015). SEM micrographs were colored using Portable Photoshop CS6.</p>
