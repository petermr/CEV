<p>For essential oils isolation, a single individual from each taxon was used, and from each of those plants dried leaves, calyces, and corollas (ca. 0.5–1.0 g), and whole aerial parts (grounded, ca. 2 g) were separately submitted to a 2 h simultaneous distillation and extraction (SDE) in the Likens-Nickerson-type apparatus [
 <xref rid="B57-plants-10-00511" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The EO of aerial parts (herba) and flower parts were isolated once, while the EOs of leaves were done in triplicate to account for isolation procedure variability. Essential oils were dissolved in dichloromethane (CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub>) and stored in amber glass vials at 4 °C until GC-FID and GC/MS analysis.
