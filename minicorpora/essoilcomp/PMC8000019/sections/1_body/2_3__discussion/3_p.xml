<p>Dominant components found in our EO profile, such as linalool, thymol,

 <xref rid="B52-plants-10-00511" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and linalool, germacrene D, and thymol have insecticidal and fungicidal effects [

 <xref rid="B53-plants-10-00511" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Geraniol, additionally, has been proven to reduce levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, a host cell receptor with a crucial role in virus SARS-CoV-2 cell entry [
 <xref rid="B54-plants-10-00511" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], and showed anti-inflammatory activity for CP-induced hepatotoxicity in rats [
 <xref rid="B55-plants-10-00511" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The available literature shows higher antimicrobial activity of the whole EO rather than a single dominant component, due to the contribution of components in minor quantities which increase the activity [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-10-00511" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, a few studies found that even a single component (linalool) has a strong antimicrobial activity, due to the chemical structure (long-chain alcohol) which has higher water solubility [
