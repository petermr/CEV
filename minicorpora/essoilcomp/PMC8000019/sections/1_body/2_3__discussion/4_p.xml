<p>Variability in the EO composition could be due to the density and EO profile of glandular trichomes among plants and organs. The present research showed a correlation between the number of peltate glandular trichomes and volume of glandular trichomes with the EO yield. In 
 <italic>S. kitaibelii,</italic> differences between the EO profiles of plant organs were previously observed [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-10-00511" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and, additionally, in 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic>, quantitative variations between the EO profiles from peltate glands on different plant organs were found [
 <xref rid="B56-plants-10-00511" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The difference in the quantities of EO components was present between peltate and capitate glands, on the same organ in 
 <italic>Salvia sclarea</italic> [
 <xref rid="B36-plants-10-00511" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], while in 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>hirtum</italic>, differences in the chemical composition of EO were found also among peltate glands of the same organ [
 <xref rid="B45-plants-10-00511" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This variation could be explained by the different biochemical capacities and distribution of the two gland types and by slight developmental differences of the oil glands [
 <xref rid="B36-plants-10-00511" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Nonetheless, all these differences could contribute to the variability between the EO profiles of plant parts and herba. 
 <italic>S. subspicata</italic> (S2) has the highest variation of leaves EO profile, dominant components in the three replicants varied from 19.6 to 35.6% (α-pinene) and 8.4–14.0% (spathulenol), while S1 had a somewhat lower variability for α-pinene (15.6–24.4%). Additionally, the herba EO sometimes possessed much higher percentages of dominant compounds than the individual leaves or flower parts (
 <italic>S. kitaibelii</italic>). In some of the herba EOs, dominant compounds were found in much lower abundances (
 <italic>S. subspicata</italic> S1) or were not detected at all (
 <italic>S. montana</italic> M1). A possible explanation is that due to a low and varying number of different glands (especially peltate) having different EO compositions on the leaves and stem could potentially give EOs a somewhat different composition when small samples are taken from the same individual. Further investigations are needed in order to assess the variability of individual glandular trichome EO composition in the studied species.
