<p>Even though the EO profile varied between plant parts, the EO profile of the analyzed species differed, showing that the chemical composition of essential oils is species specific. These findings further corroborate the use of essential oils in chemophenetic research. All these results show the important role of EO composition particularly when choosing plants for cultivation or from natural populations. 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> and 
 <italic>S. kitaibelii</italic> are used as food flavoring agents or herbal teas or tinctures, either from cultivation fields or from nature. In light of our results, an increment of the desired EO component could be achieved by harvesting a particular part or the whole plant, e.g., for the highest yield of thymol or geraniol flower region from 
 <italic>S. montana</italic>, M2 and M1, respectively should be used, while for linalool whole aerial parts of 
 <italic>S. kitaibelii</italic> could be used.
