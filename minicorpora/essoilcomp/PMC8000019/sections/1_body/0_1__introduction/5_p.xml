<p>This research was carried out to determine the composition of the EO and micromorphological features of different plant organs of three 
 <italic>Satureja</italic> species which have different distributions, and their possible relation. The micromorphological investigation of 
 <italic>S. kitaibelii</italic> is done for the first time. The studied plants were chosen based on the different geographic distribution patterns. Two taxa with a narrow distribution, 
 <italic>S. kitaibelii</italic> and 
 <italic>S. subspicata</italic> (both subspecies included), and one widely distributed, 
 <italic>S. montana</italic>. Two samples of 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> were selected based on the literature data that suggest different chemotypes in individuals from mountain and coastal regions [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00511-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Additionally, the relationship between the number and type of glandular trichomes, and essential oil profile and relative yield, has been investigated.
