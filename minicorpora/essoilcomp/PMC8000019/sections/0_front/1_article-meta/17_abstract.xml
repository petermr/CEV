 <p>The essential oil (EO) composition of 
  <italic>Satureja</italic> plants is highly variable. Recent studies suggest that there is an even difference in the EO composition from different plant organs within the same plant. This study aims to examine the chemical profile of EOs and the micromorphological characteristics of different organs of three 
  <italic>Satureja</italic> species. The relationship between the number of glandular trichomes and EOs profile and relative yield is also investigated. Individuals from five populations were visualized using a scanning electron microscope, while EOs of leaves, calyces, corollas, and whole aerial parts were isolated using simultaneous distillation and extraction and analyzed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Three types of glandular trichomes were detected. Peltate trichomes were present on all plant organs of studied species, while two types of capitate trichomes show different organ and species preferences. The EOs profiles differed across the plant parts, but showed a species specific composition. Univariate and multivariate statistics were used to show a correlation between the peltate trichomes and EO yield, and chemophenetic significance of EO profiles.
