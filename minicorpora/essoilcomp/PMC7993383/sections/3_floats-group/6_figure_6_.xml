  <p>Evidence for the interaction site between ONP and TrxR. (A) ONP and C
   <bold>3</bold> selectively inhibited pure TrxR. (The illustration is the structural difference between ONP and C
   <bold>3</bold>). (B) Varying concentrations of ONP showed the difference in activity inhibition of WT TrxR and U498C TrxR1. (The illustration exhibited the difference between WT TrxR and U498C TrxR1). (C) ONP at a concentration of 5 μM inhibited the activity of pure TrxR in a time-dependent manner. The enzyme activities in (A), (B), and (C) are all detected by the DTNB method. The NADPH pre-reduced enzyme was incubated with different concentrations of ONP or C
   <bold>3</bold> for 1 h, and then the enzyme activity in the system was detected by the DTNB method. (D) Covalent docking for ONP with the C-terminal site 498 of the chain A of the mouse TrxR1. The docking experiment was conducted using the covalent docking protocol in the SchrödingerSuite 2015-1 program. The monomer of TrxR1 is represented by a cyan cartoon. The interacting residues in the ONP and active site are shown in orange and purple sticks. Data are expressed as mean ± S. E. of three experiments. **
