  <p>Contribution of targeting TrxR to ONP cytotoxicity. (A) The positive correlation between inhibition of HeLa cell viability by ONP and inhibition of intracellular TrxR activity by ONP. Different concentrations of ONP were incubated with HeLa cells for 24 h, and the intracellular TrxR activity was detected by the Trx-mediated endpoint insulin reduction assay. The HeLa cell survival rate under the same administration conditions was detected by the trypan blue exclusion staining method. (B) The difference in cytotoxicity of ONP towards the HeLa cell line knocked down TrxR1. ONP (20 and 40 μM) acted on HeLa-
   <italic>shNT</italic> and HeLa-
   <italic>shTrxR1</italic> cells for 24 h, respectively, and the cell viability was detected by the trypan blue exclusion staining method (average of three independent experiments). (C) The difference in cytotoxicity of ONP to HEK 293T cell line overexpressing TrxR1. The survival rate of HEK-
   <italic>IRES</italic> and HEK-
   <italic>TrxR1</italic> cells under the same experimental conditions as (B) was detected by the trypan blue exclusion staining method (average of three independent experiments). Data are expressed as mean ± S. E. of three experiments. **
