  <p>Killing HeLa cells by ONP primarily 
   <italic>via</italic> inducing apoptosis. (A) Nuclear morphological changes after ONP treatment. HeLa cells were incubated for 24 h with 0, 10, 20, or 40 μM of ONP treatment, and the nuclei were stained by Hoechst 33342. Nuclear morphology changes then were observed under a fluorescence microscope. The bright filed pictures (top panel) and the fluorescence pictures (bottom panel) were imaged and acquired. Scale bars: 20 μm. Arrows refer to the condensed and irregular nuclei with bright fluorescence stained by Hoechst 33342 in (A). (B) Assessment of apoptosis by Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining assay. HeLa cells were treated with 0, 10, 20, or 40 μM of ONP treatment for 24 h, and the numbers of apoptotic cells were measured by the Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining assay. (C) Quantification of apoptotic cells (Q2 and Q4) from (B) by flow cytometry. (D) Activation of caspase 3 in HeLa cells by ONP. HeLa cells were incubated with 0, 10, 20, or 40 μM of ONP treatment for 24 h, and the caspase 3 activity in the cellular extracts was measured by a colorimetric assay. Data are expressed as mean ± S. E. of three experiments. **
