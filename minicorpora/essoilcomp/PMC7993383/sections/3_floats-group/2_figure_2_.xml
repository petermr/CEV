  <p>Inhibiting tumor cell growth by ONP. (A) Cytotoxicity of ONP, C
   <bold>2,</bold> and C
   <bold>3</bold> to HeLa cells. After treating HeLa cells with the indicated concentrations of ONP, C
   <bold>2,</bold> and C
   <bold>3</bold> for 48 h, the cell viability of HeLa cells was determined by the MTT method. (B) Inhibition of the growth of HeLa cells in a time-dependent manner by ONP. HeLa cells were treated with ONP at designated concentrations for 24, 48, and 72 h, and the cell survival rate was detected by the MTT method. (C) Cytotoxicity of ONP towards multiple tumor cell lines. After different concentrations of ONP were incubated with HeLa, HepG2, and A549 cells for 48 h, the cell viability was detected by the MTT method. (D) Selectivity of ONP for tumor cells. The designated concentrations of ONP acted on HeLa cells, BEAS-2B, and L02 cells for 24 h, and the cell viability was detected by the MTT method. After treatment of HeLa cells, BEAS-2B, and L02 cells with ONP at specified concentrations for 24 h, the cell viability was detected by the MTT method. Data are expressed as mean ± S. E. of three experiments. **
