  <p>Inhibiting cellular TrxR activity by ONP. (A) TRFS-green-based live-cell imaging TrxR activity assay. HeLa cells were incubated with 0, 10, 20, or 40 μM of ONP or 40 μM C
   <bold>2</bold> or C
   <bold>3</bold> for 12 h. Cellular TrxR activity was assessed by TRFS-green. The fluorescence images were acquired by inverted fluorescence microscopy. (B) Fast-TRFS-based cell lysate TrxR activity assay. HeLa cell lysate (0.3 mg·mL
   <sup>−1</sup>) was incubated with NADPH (100 µM) for 5 min at 37 °C. ONP (0, 10, 20, or 40 µM) and blank sample (0.1% DMSO) were added to and the mixture was continued to incubate for 1 h. The probe Fast-TRFS (10 µM) and NADPH (100 µM) were added to initiate the enzymatic reduction of Fast-TRFS. The fluorescence change at 460 nm was recorded (λex = 345 nm) for 10 min on a fluorescent plate reader (Tecan Infinite M200), and the rate of fluorescence increase within the initial 5 min was calculated. The relative TrxR activity was expressed as the percentage of the DMSO-treated sample. Inhibition of intracellular TrxR activity by ONP in a concentration and time-dependent manner (C), and the difference of inhibition of cellular TrxR activity by ONP, C
   <bold>2,</bold> and C
   <bold>3</bold> (D) were assayed by the Trx-mediated endpoint insulin reduction. After the HeLa cells were treated with varying concentrations of ONP, C
   <bold>2,</bold> and C
   <bold>3</bold> for 12 or 24 h, the enzyme activity of TrxR in HeLa cells was determined by the Trx-mediated endpoint insulin reduction assay. Scale bars: 20 μm. Data are expressed as mean ± S. E. of three experiments. **
