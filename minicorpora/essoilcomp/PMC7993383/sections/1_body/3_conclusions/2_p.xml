<p>We isolated and characterized compounds ONP, C
 <bold>2</bold>, and C
 <bold>3</bold> from a new genus 
 <italic>Shangwua</italic>, and evaluated the pharmacological function of ONP with interfering with cellular redox signaling. Further experiments demonstrated that ONP robustly inhibits TrxR, causing perturbation of cellular redox homeostasis with the favor of oxidative stress. Knockdown of the TrxR expression sensitizes cells to the ONP treatment while overexpression of the enzyme reduces the potency of ONP, underpinning the correlation of TrxR inhibition to the observed cytotoxicity of ONP. Our results for the first time revealed the bioactive ingredients and antitumor activity from the new genus 
 <italic>Shangwua</italic> and served as the discovery of the secondary metabolites and the validation of medicinal value for 
 <italic>Shangwua</italic>.
