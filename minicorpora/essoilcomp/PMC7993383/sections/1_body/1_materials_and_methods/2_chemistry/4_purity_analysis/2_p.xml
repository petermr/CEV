<p>The purity analysis of ONP was performed on Waters pump 1525 and PDA 2998 series HPLC systems with reversed-phase C18 (4.6 × 150 mm, 5 µm) chromatographic columns at room temperature. ONP was dissolved in chromatographic methanol, and the injection volume was 10 µL. The mobile phases are methanol and water, and the flow rate is 1.0 mL/min. The maximum absorbance in the range of 210–400 nm is used as the detection wavelength.</p>
