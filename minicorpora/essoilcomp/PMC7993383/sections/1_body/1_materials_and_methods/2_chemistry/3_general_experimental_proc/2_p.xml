<p>200–300 mesh silica gel and 10–40 µm GF 254 silica gel plates (Qingdao Marine Chemical Factory, China), 150–200 mesh RP-C18 silica gel (Merck), and Sephadex LH-20 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech UK Ltd.) were employed for column chromatography. Semipreparative HPLC with a reversed-phase C18 (150 × 10 mm, 10 µm) column was carried out on the isolation and purification of samples. 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectroscopic data were used to a Varian Mercury-600BB or Bruker Avance III-400 instrument.
