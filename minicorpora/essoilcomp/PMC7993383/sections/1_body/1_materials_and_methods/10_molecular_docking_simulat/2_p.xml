<p>The crystal structure of rat TrxR1 (PDB code 3EAN, chain A) was employed in the present docking study as we described previously
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>29</sup>
 </xref>. The residue Sec498 in chain A was selected and further prepared in the protein preparation wizard module as the reactive residue involved in the Michael addition. In addition, the residue Sec498 was also set as the centroid of the docking pocket. The docking simulation was carried out with the default parameters.
