<p>Cells (2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>/well) were seeded in a 12-well plate and were cultured overnight. The cells were further treated with indicated concentrations of ONP (20 and 40 µM) for 24 h. The control cells were treated with 0.1% DMSO alone. Then, the cells were stained with trypan blue (0.4%, w/v), and the number of dead (stained) cells and viable (non-stained) cells were counted.
