<p>Cells (5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup>−1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>/well) from above different cell lines were incubated with agents and grown in triplicate in a 96-well plate for 24, 48, or 72 h at 37 °C in a final volume of 100 µL. The cells treated with 0.1% DMSO alone were the control group. After incubated for the designed time, MTT reagent (5 µL/well, 5 mg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) was added and continued culturing for an additional 4 h at 37 °C. Formazan crystals then were solubilized in solvent 100 µL extraction buffer (10% SDS, 0.1% HCl, and 5% iso-butanol). The absorbance was read at 570 nm using a microplate reader (Thermo Scientific Multiskan GO, Finland)) to calculate the cell viability.
