<p>HeLa cells (5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>) were plated in a 6-well plate and were cultured overnight. The cells were then incubated with different concentrations of ONP for 24 h. Subsequently, the cells were harvested and washed with PBS. According to the Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining apoptosis detection kit (Zoman Biotech, Beijing, China), the apoptotic cells were determined and analyzed by flow cytometry with Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences, USA).
