<p>Hoechst 33342 dye is used to detect the morphological changes of apoptotic cells. Briefly, HeLa cells (2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>) were seeded in a 12-well plate and were cultured overnight. The cells subsequently were incubated with a designed concentration of ONP for 24 h. Hoechst 33342 dye (5 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) was added and continued culturing for 30 minutes. Rinsed HeLa cells with the medium to remove the remaining Hoechst 33342. The stained nuclei were photographed under a fluorescent microscope.
