 <bold>2</bold> or C
 <bold>3</bold> for 8 h. Then the cells were removed from the medium and subsequently treated with TRFS-green (10 µM) in a fresh FBS-free medium for 4 h at 37 °C in dark. The cells were washed to remove the residual TRFS-green. The cells were imaged under a fluorescent microscope (Floid Cell Imaging Station, Thermo Fisher).
