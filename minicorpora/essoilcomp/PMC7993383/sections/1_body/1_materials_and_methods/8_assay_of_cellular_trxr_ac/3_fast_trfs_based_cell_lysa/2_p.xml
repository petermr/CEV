 </xref>. Briefly, HeLa cells were plated in 100-mm culture dishes and were cultured overnight. The cells then were collected and lysed with RIPA buffer. Total cellular protein contents as the source of TrxR were quantified by the Bradford procedure. Subsequently, the HeLa cell lysate (0.3 mg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) was incubated with NADPH (100 µM) for 5 min at 37 °C. Test drug, ONP (10, 20, or 40 µM each), and blank sample (0.1%DMSO) were then added and the mixture was continued to incubate for 1 h. The probe Fast-TRFS (10 µM) and NADPH (100 µM) were added to initiate the enzymatic reduction of Fast-TRFS. The fluorescence change at 460 nm was recorded (
 <italic>λ</italic>ex = 345 nm) for 10 min on a fluorescent plate reader (Tecan Infinite M200), and the rate of fluorescence increase within the initial 5 min was calculated. The relative TrxR activity was expressed as the percentage of the DMSO-treated sample.
