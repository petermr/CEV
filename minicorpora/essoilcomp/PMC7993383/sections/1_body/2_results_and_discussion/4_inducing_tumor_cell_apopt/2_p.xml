<p>ONP with similar properties as the activities of sesquiterpene lactones reported so far can significantly suppress the growth of tumor cells. Functionally, most of the reported sesquiterpene lactones inhibit tumor cell proliferation

 </xref>. Next, we thus sought to confirm whether ONP can induce tumor cell apoptosis. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>, we had fully demonstrated that ONP can promote HeLa cell apoptosis through various methods. First, we stained with Hoechst 33342 to observe whether HeLa cells treated with diverse concentrations of ONP can undergo morphological changes of apoptosis. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3(A)</xref>, our experimental results displayed that after different concentrations of ONP acted on HeLa cells, especially treatment with 40 µM, ONP could significantly cause HeLa cell nuclei to shrink and shine, a typical morphological change of apoptosis. To further confirm the apoptotic morphological changes produced by ONP-treated HeLa cells to eventually induce apoptosis, Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI) double staining reagents were employed to stain again and detect the number of apoptotic cells by flow cytometry to evaluate the ability of ONP to induce HeLa cell apoptosis. The results in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3(B)</xref> intuitively exhibited that ONP effectively induced HeLa cell apoptosis. The number of apoptotic cells increased with the enhancement of ONP treatment concentration (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3(C)</xref>), indicating directly that ONP could induce HeLa cell apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, our results showed that ONP induced HeLa cell apoptosis in a caspase 3 activity-dependent manner. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3(D)</xref>, the activity of intracellular caspase 3 activity increased remarkably with the increase of ONP treatment concentration, which further confirmed that ONP kills cells basically in the form of apoptosis. Taken together, ONP can significantly induce caspase 3-dependent apoptosis in HeLa cells in a concentration-dependent manner to contribute to the ability to kill tumor cells.
