<p>We first studied the secondary metabolites of the new genus 
 <italic>Shangwua</italic> and discovered a TrxR inhibitor with antitumor activity from it. Our results provided a basis not only for the development of bioactive components of the genus 
 <italic>Shangwua</italic> but also for the establishment of the medicinal value of the 
 <italic>Shangwua</italic>. For the first time, we revealed the antitumor activity of the bioactive ingredient ONP and its antitumor mechanism targeting TrxR, inspiring the development of new pharmacological activities of ONP and providing support for the contribution of the target TrxR to the antitumor effect. Therefore, the discovery of ONP from 
 <italic>Shangwua</italic> and the report of its antitumor activity are of great significance to the establishment of new genus resource components and medicinal value.
