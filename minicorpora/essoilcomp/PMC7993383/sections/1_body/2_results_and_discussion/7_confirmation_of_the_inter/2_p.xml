<p>To confirm the key performance of α, β-unsaturated ketone fragments on the lactone ring in the interaction between ONP and TrxR, we explored the interaction of ONP and C
 <bold>3</bold> with pure TrxR. The results were shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6(A)</xref>. Compared with C
 <bold>3</bold>, ONP could substantially inhibit the pure TrxR activity in a concentration-dependent manner. The vital structural difference between C
 <bold>3</bold> and ONP was that the α, β-unsaturated ketone fragment on the lactone ring (the inset of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6(A)</xref>). ONP bearing this key fragment had remarkable enzyme inhibitory activity while C
 <bold>3</bold> was almost silenced, heavily validating the importance of α, β-unsaturated ketone fragment in weakening TrxR activity consistent with the literature

 </xref>. In addition, ONP at a concentration of 5 µM also had the ability to inhibit pure TrxR in a time-dependent manner (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6(C)</xref>), and the inhibition ability was nearly saturated after incubation for 1 h. Existing evidence highly confirms that the redox-active Sec residue at the C-terminus of TrxR plays a cardinal role in the inhibition of TrxR activity by small molecules

 </xref>. The reason is that compared with the homologous cysteine (Cys), Sec has stronger nucleophilicity and stronger resistance to irreversible oxidation

 </xref>. The high nucleophilicity of Sec residues and exposure to the outer surface of the enzyme render TrxR assailable to be modified by electrophiles

 </xref>. To validate whether Sec residues also play a key role in the interaction between ONP and TrxR, we constructed a control protein for the WT TrxR1, which mutated the Sec at position 498 of the C-terminus to Cys to obtain the U498C TrxR1 mutant enzyme (the inset of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6(B)</xref>). The effect of ONP on wild-type TrxR1 and recombinant U498C TrxR1 was shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6(B)</xref>. ONP hardly inhibited U498C TrxR1, suggesting that the site where ONP interacted with pure TrxR is Sec residue at position 498. We then docked the receptor rat TrxR1 with ONP. The result was shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6(D)</xref>. The β-position carbon atom of the lactone ring carbonyl in the ONP can covalently bond well with the Sec at position 498 in the protein. This also proved once again that the interaction sites between ONP and pure TrxR were the β-position carbon atom on the lactone ring and the Sec at position 498 of the enzyme. In short, our data fully confirms that ONP with α, β-unsaturated ketone structure can well capture Sec residues to heavily inhibit TrxR activity, which provides strong evidence for explaining the above-mentioned essential intracellular processes.
