<p>As one of the essential antioxidant enzymes in cells is TrxR. If the TrxR activity is inhibited, the intracellular antioxidant capacity for tumor cells is partially lessened, thereby causing the above-mentioned substantial accumulation of ROS

 </xref>. We thus examined the effect of ONP on cellular TrxR activity. Firstly, the TRFS-green probe established by our group
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>42</sup>
 </xref> was invested to detect the effects of the ONP, C
 <bold>1</bold>, and C
 <bold>2</bold> on TrxR activity in HeLa cells. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(A)</xref>, ONP harbored an effective ability to suppress intracellular TrxR activity concentration-dependently from the qualitative results of fluorescence microscopy imaging. While compounds C
 <bold>2</bold> and C
 <bold>3</bold> remained almost silent towards TrxR activity in cells at our observed concentrations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(A)</xref>). Likewise, the fluorescence quantification results were also demonstrated by Fast-green, another detection probe for TrxR (

 </xref>. To further validate the qualitative and quantitative results of the probes cell imaging, we employed the classic Trx-mediated insulin reduction method to assess the ability of ONP, C
 <bold>2</bold>, and C
 <bold>3</bold> to repress TrxR activity in HeLa cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(C)</xref>). Consistent with expectations, ONP remarkably suppressed intracellular TrxR activity in a concentration-and time-dependent manner (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(C)</xref>). Whereas there was no significant difference in the inhibitory effects of C
 <bold>2</bold> and C
 <bold>3</bold> on intracellular TrxR activity compared with the control group consistent with the probe test results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(D)</xref>). By comparing the structures of ONP, C
 <bold>2</bold>, and C
 <bold>3</bold>, the molecular skeleton bearing α, β unsaturated ketone fragments seems to be highly crucial for their abilities to restrain intracellular TrxR activity, which requires further validation. Collectively, our data strongly confirmed that ONP can excellently inhibit TrxR activity in HeLa cells.
