<p>We then explored the mechanism by which ONP induced HeLa apoptosis and showed selective inhibition of tumor cell growth. Considering that one of the biochemical characteristics of carcinoma cells is that they exhibit a higher level of oxidative stress than normal cells, and further stimulation by cytotoxic agents leads to preferentially induce tumor cell apoptosis

 </xref>. We thus observed the changes in ROS levels in HeLa cells treated with ONP to validate the elevated oxidative stress level is the mechanism by which ONP selectively induces tumor cell apoptosis. We administered a fixed concentration of ONP to HeLa cells for different periods and alternately detected the level of intracellular ROS by DCFH-DA probe. Our results clearly showed that the intracellular ROS level reached the highest level after ONP treated HeLa cells for 5 h. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(A)</xref>, the green fluorescence enhanced dramatically after treating HeLa cells with 20 and 40 µM ONP for 5 h, suggesting that a large amount of ROS was produced. The effect of 40 µM treatment was much better than that of 20 µM, indicating that excessive accumulation of ROS is also concentration-dependent (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(B)</xref>). To confirm this result, we used a DHE probe with a different fluorescence wavelength from DCFH-DA to detect again the level of ROS especially superoxide anion in ONP-treated HeLa cells. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(C,D)</xref>, after treatment of HeLa cells with a concentration of 20 µM and 40 µM ONP, intracellular red fluorescence increased remarkably, which once more proved that excessive accumulation of ROS was generated in the HeLa cells treated with ONP. A cascade of ROS generation inevitably broke the upper limit of the cellular adaptive oxidative stress response, and eventually provoked HeLa cell apoptosis.
