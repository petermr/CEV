<p id="Par36">According to the findings of the present study, it was found that in the two genotypes of lemon balm, light treatments play an effective role in changing the content of monoterpenes. Since most of the essential oil components of lemon balm in this study were monoterpenes, it is concluded that the quality and property of essential oil will probably change significantly. Ghaffari et al. (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2019</xref>) reached the same results with the current study about the increase in the content of monoterpenes under LED lamps. In the present study, red + blue LED light was the major contributor to the increase in monoterpenes. On the contrary, in studies by Ghaffari et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2019</xref>) and Tohidi et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2019</xref>), blue light played this role. Therefore, this difference reflects the different effects of LED light on the essential oil of different plants.
