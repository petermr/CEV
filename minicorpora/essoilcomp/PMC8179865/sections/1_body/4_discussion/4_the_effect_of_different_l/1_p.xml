<p id="Par38">Different light sources changed the content of sesquiterpenes of two genotypes of lemon balm. As in Jalal et al.'s study (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2015</xref>), in this study, the main sesquiterpene of lemon balm was ß-caryophyllene epoxide (11%) that its vector was correlated with white LED light environment in both genotypes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In the study of Kittler et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2018</xref>) ß-caryophyllene, germacrene-D, and ß-caryophyllene epoxide constituted the main sesquiterpene compounds of lemon balm genotypes. However, in the study conducted by Chung et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2010</xref>), caryophyllene (0.8%) and farnesene (0.1%) were the most common sesquiterpene. So, it can be said that the essential oil composition of species and genotypes of a plant are different under different conditions. ß-caryophyllene is a natural bicyclic sesquiterpene that has also been involved in the creation of a spicy taste of black pepper and many essential oils such as

 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Cannabis sativa</italic>. This compound has received much attention because of its cyclobutane ring, which is scarce in nature (Taherpour et al.
