<p>The obtained results indicated that drying techniques had significant influence on EO content (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32218-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and that the highest amount (0.25%) was acquired by shade‐drying. The lowest amounts of EO were acquired from oven‐drying at 60°C (0.10%) and 80°C (0.11%). However, there was no significant difference between the sun‐ and oven‐drying (40°C) methods. Thus, EO yield of shade‐dried plants was greater than that using other drying methods. With respect to different drying procedures, changes in the EO yield depend on the type of tissue temperature, time, and drying method employed (Dehghani Mashkani et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32218-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Similar results were also reported by Ozdemir et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn32218-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), who dried 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Origanum onites</italic> L. in oven‐drying at 60°C, under shade and sunlight, and revealed that the highest EO yield was obtained by shade‐drying. Mokhtarikhah et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn32218-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), demonstrated that EO yield of sun‐dried spearmint was higher than that of the fresh sample. Saeidi et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn32218-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) indicated that EO yields of shade and oven‐dried (at 40°C) 
 <italic>Mentha longifolia</italic> L. were greater than yields obtained by other drying methods. In research carried out on seeds (Rebey et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32218-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), the effect of various drying techniques on EO yield was studied and results indicated that EO amount in shade‐dried samples was more than that obtained by oven‐ and sun‐drying methods. Shade‐drying is, evidently, one of the most suitable methods for drying herbs. Because of the lower temperatures used in shade‐drying, the evaporation of fragrant compositions is lower, and amounts of EOs were found to be more than those samples subjected to oven‐ or sun‐drying (Mirhosseini et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32218-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>).
