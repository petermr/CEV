<p>Spathulenol, α‐cadinol, intermedeol, guaia‐3,10(14)‐dien‐11‐ol, and epi‐α‐bisabolol were recognized as the dominant constituents of oxygenated sesquiterpenes, among which the highest content (54.1%) was related to spathulenol in plants dried under sunlight. Because to their higher polarity, oxygenated sesquiterpenes have higher boiling points compared to hydrocarbon sesquiterpenes. Hence, these compositions do not evaporate easily under sun‐ or oven‐drying. Previous researchers have reported similar results to those obtained in the current study; the increase of oxygenated sesquiterpenes in aromatic plants treated at high temperatures (Hazrati et al.,
