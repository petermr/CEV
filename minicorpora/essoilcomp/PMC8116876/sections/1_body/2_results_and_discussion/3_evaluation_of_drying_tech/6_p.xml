<p>A dendrogram of cluster analyses, using EO value and compound, separated the different drying methods into four groups (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32218-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The microwave‐ and oven‐drying (at 60 and 80°C) methods were placed in the first group, while the sun‐ and oven‐ (at 40°C) drying methods were placed in the second group. The fresh and shade‐drying methods were placed in the third group. Freeze‐drying methods was placed in the separate group. α‐Terpinene and p‐cymene led to classification of the oven‐ (60 and 80°C) and microwave‐drying methods in the first group, while δ‐cadinene, spathulenol, and α‐cadinol were the most important compounds responsible for existence placed in the second group.
