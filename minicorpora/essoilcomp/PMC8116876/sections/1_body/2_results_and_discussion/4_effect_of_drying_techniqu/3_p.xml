<p>The current data show that the use of drying techniques has an affirmative effect on the antioxidant power of 
 <italic>S. lavandulifolia</italic> EO. There is not a great deal of extant information on the influence of various drying methods on the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>S. lavandulifolia</italic> EO. Commonly, the antioxidant powers of plant EOs were ascribable to their chemical combination and particularly to their main compositions. Therefore, the various levels of the antioxidant attributes found for the investigated EOs extracted from 
 <italic>S. lavandulifolia</italic> samples dried with various techniques may be ascribed to the low change of their various main compositions, especially the amounts of spathulenol and myrcene. Apparently, there exists a consensus that the antioxidant attributes of EOs cannot simply be described by the practice of their main compositions (Ahmed et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32218-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Other studies have shown that spathulenol, E‐caryophyllene, and germacrene‐D could also be responsible for the antioxidative activity reported (Baschieri et al.,
