<p>Our findings showed that transformations occurred in EO compounds of 
 <italic>S. lavandulifolia</italic> during drying related to the drying technique and temperature employed. The amounts of bioactive substances in fragrant plants are related to drying technique and temperature, in addition to the biological and morphological characteristics of the plants. As well as the above, the results showed that drying under oven (60 and 80°C) caused a decrease in EO value, while drying by shade resulted in the greatest amount of EO. Both microwave‐ and oven‐drying considerably decreased α‐pinene, β‐pinene, and myrcene amounts. Thus, depending on the flavored composition, one of the drying techniques can be used. Overall, shade‐ and sun‐drying were capable of producing the optimum values of EO and spathulenol, respectively.
