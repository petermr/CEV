<p>The EO analysis was done using a GC equipped with MS detector (Thermo Quest‐Finnigan) and a 60 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 µm fused silica column (DB‐5). The oven temperature was initially at 60°C, increased by 5°C/min for 38 min, and then maintained at 250°C for 10 min. Helium gas was used as a carrier gas with a flow rate of 1.1 ml/min. The splitting ratio was 1:100 and the injector and detector temperatures were adjusted at 250 and 280°C, respectively. The ionization voltage, scan time, and mass range were 70 eV, 0.4s, and 40–300 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic>, respectively. The EO constituents were determined using retention indices as well as Wiley and NIST 11.0 mass‐spectral libraries. The percentage of compounds was calculated by electronic integration of FID peak areas without the use of response factor correlation.
