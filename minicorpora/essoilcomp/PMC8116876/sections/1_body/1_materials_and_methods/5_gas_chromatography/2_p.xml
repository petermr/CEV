<p>A gas chromatograph (Agilant 7890B) equipped with a flame ionization detector, and an HP‐5 capillary column (length 30 m, internal diameter 0.25 mm and 0.25 μm film thickness) were used for the analysis of EOs. Temperature plan contains 2 min at 60°C and enhancement to 250°C with a ramp of 5°C/min. Helium gas was used as the carrier at a flow rate of 1.1 ml/min in split ratio of 1:100.</p>
