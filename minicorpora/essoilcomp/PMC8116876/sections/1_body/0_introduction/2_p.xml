 <italic>Stachys lavandulifolia,</italic> which belongs to 
 <italic>Lamiaceae</italic>, is an endemic and perennial flowering plant, which grows as woody shrubs on mountainsides of Iran. Its flowers are arranged as spikes, similar in appearance to those of cotton, and range from blue to purple in color (Jalilian et al.,
