<p>Accordingly, the intentions of this study were: (a) to study the influence of seven drying techniques (shade‐, sunlight‐, freeze‐, oven (40, 60, and 80°C) and microwave‐drying) on the EO composition and yield in 
 <italic>S. lavandulifolia</italic>, (b) to determine the best drying method in respect of maintaining the principal EO compositions of the 
 <italic>S. lavandulifolia</italic> and, (c) to investigate the impact of various drying methods on the biological properties.
