 <italic>Stachys lavandulifolia</italic> is a valuable endemic plant to Iran which has not been comprehensively studied in terms of the effects of various drying techniques on its volatile composition. The principal constituents of the 
 <italic>S. lavandulifolia</italic> EO composition have been previously reported as α‐pinene, β‐pinene, germacrene‐D, and (Z)‐β‐ocimene (Bahadori et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32218-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). However, no studies have documented a suitable drying method for the preservation of volatile oil compounds in 
 <italic>S. lavandulifolia</italic>. The antioxidant attributes of bio‐active molecules play a main role in preventing damage caused by free radicals. The working mechanism of some antioxidants will be changed by exposure to temperature variation, leading to reduction in antioxidant activity (Réblová,
