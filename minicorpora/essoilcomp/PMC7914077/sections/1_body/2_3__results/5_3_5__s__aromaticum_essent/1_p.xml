<p>Nitrite levels were measured in the supernatant of BALB/c peritoneal macrophages and showed a decrease in cells treated with 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil (0.22 ± 0.067 
 <italic>μ</italic>M NaNO
 <sub>2</sub>) and eugenol (0.32 ± 0.155 
 <italic>μ</italic>M NaNO
 <sub>2</sub>), with reductions of 57.69% and 38.46%, respectively, when compared to the untreated cells (0.52 ± 0.224 
 <italic>μ</italic>M NaNO
 <sub>2</sub>), although these reductions were not statistically significant. However, a significant reduction in the nitrite levels of cells stimulated with 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> and treated with 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil (0.71 ± 0.123 
 <italic>μ</italic>M NaNO

 <italic>μ</italic>M NaNO
 <sub>2</sub>, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.003) was observed, with reductions of 47.01% and 48.05% respectively, when compared to stimulated and untreated cells (1.34 ± 0.152
