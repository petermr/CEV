<p>The inhibitory concentrations of 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil and eugenol against epimastigotes and intracellular amastigotes of 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> are presented in 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Both compounds presented concentration-dependent inhibitory activity, presenting differences in growth inhibition on epimastigote forms only at 7.8 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0321) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(a)</xref>). The similar inhibition activity of 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil and eugenol was evidenced by the absence of statistical differences between their IC
 <sub>50</sub> values. In contrast, activity against intracellular amastigotes showed slightly larger differences in 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil and eugenol, with eugenol exhibiting greater activity than essential oil at the highest analyzed concentration (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0286) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(b)</xref>). Compared to epimastigote activity, both compounds resulted in a reduction in intracellular amastigote inhibition, with 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil displaying a 2.2-fold increase in IC
 <sub>50</sub> value against intracellular amastigotes compared to the IC
 <sub>50</sub> against epimastigote forms.
