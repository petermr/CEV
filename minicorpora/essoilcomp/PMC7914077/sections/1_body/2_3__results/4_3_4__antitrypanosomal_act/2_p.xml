<p>Cytotoxicity assay revealed that 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil did not exhibit toxicity for BALB/c peritoneal macrophages even at the highest concentration analyzed (2,000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL). Eugenol displayed greater cytotoxicity than 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil, directly influencing its selectivity index. Thus, although eugenol exhibited better activity against intracellular amastigotes, 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil exhibited a higher SI value (
