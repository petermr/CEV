<p>To assess antimicrobial activity, the disk diffusion test was performed. When checking the diameter of inhibition halo against Gram-positive (
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>) and Gram-negative (
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>) bacteria, the essential oil and eugenol showed a greater halo against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The MIC assay revealed the significant antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil, showing a similar effect against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and being more effective against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> than eugenol (
