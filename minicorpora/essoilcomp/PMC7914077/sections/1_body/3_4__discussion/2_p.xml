<p>Numerous studies have identified and quantified similar chemical compounds in the essential oils of 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic>, revealing that this species has a similar chemotype to eugenol-rich chemotype. Eugenol was identified as a major compound (90.3%) in an essential oil extracted from the south of Brazil, in addition to 
 <italic>Î²</italic>-caryophyllene (4.83%) and eugenol acetate (1.87%) [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], while another study, also on essential oil of cloves from the south of Brazil, observed the presence of eugenol (56.06%) and caryophyllene (39.63%) in greater quantities [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], very similar to the amount found in the present study. 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oils obtained in China [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and Italy [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] also had eugenol as their major compound, with 90.84% and 77.9%, respectively. The amount of eugenol contained in the essential oil and the difference between the compounds can be directly related to the different geographic areas where the plant has grown up, which can be influenced or changed by biotic and abiotic factors such as seasonality, stage of development, age of the plant, and climatic conditions [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In addition, the extraction method used to obtain the oil can also affect its chemical composition, as distillation and storage conditions are capable of influencing the content of its volatile metabolites [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Differences in chemical composition can be directly related to pharmacological properties, as noted in the antimicrobial activity tests in the present study.
