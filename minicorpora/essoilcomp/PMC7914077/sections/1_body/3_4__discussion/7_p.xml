<p>Eugenol is a chemotype found in several plant products and is one of the main constituents of clove essential oil. It is used in both food and cosmetics industries as a flavoring agent, and it is an excellent antimicrobial, having activity against fungi and bacteria [

Eugenol has free hydroxyls in its structure that may be responsible for the antimicrobial activity verified in this research, since the antimicrobial activity of nitric oxide (NO) is conferred by its free hydroxyl groups. It was deduced that the hydroxyl group in eugenol links to proteins, preventing enzymatic action. The cell membrane suffered ruptures in the presence of the essential oil because it is rich in lipophilic compounds. This damage directly affects the maintenance of cellular pH and the balance of the inorganic ions. The main factors responsible for this damage are monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, which produce different effects in different microorganisms [
