<p>There are reports that 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> exhibited activity against trypomastigote forms of 
 <italic>Trypanosoma brucei brucei</italic>, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 10.4 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. However, it also exhibited cytotoxicity on macrophages (CC
 <sub>50</sub> 22.4 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) and low SI (2.2) [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], unlike what was observed in the present study. A study analyzed 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil against 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> (Y strain), obtaining IC
 <sub>50</sub>/24 h values of 99.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for epimastigotes and 57.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for bloodstream trypomastigotes. Eugenol was also evaluated, presenting IC
 <sub>50</sub>/24h values of 246 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for epimastigotes and 76 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for trypomastigotes [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].
