<p>The cell death mechanism of intracellular amastigotes may be an event associated with the activation of macrophage microbicidal mechanisms, particularly the increase in the production of NO levels [
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], which can be indirectly measured by the quantification of nitrite in the supernatant of BALB/c peritoneal macrophages. Therefore, in an attempt to better understand activity against intracellular amastigote forms, we carried out an analysis of the nitrite quantification of 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic>-stimulated peritoneal macrophages treated with 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil or eugenol. A significant decrease in nitrite levels was observed in cells stimulated with 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> and treated with essential oil or eugenol. Eugenol notably modulates NO production, inducing suppression of NO production and iNOS protein expression in carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury in rats [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and in nicotine-induced murine peritoneal macrophages [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Eugenolol and glyceryl-isoeugenol, two derivatives of eugenol, suppressed LPS-induced iNOS expression by downregulating NF-kB and AP-1 through the inhibition of the MAPKs and Akt/IkB-alpha signaling pathways [
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The inhibition of NO production observed in macrophages treated with 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil is probably due to the known NO suppression by eugenol. Therefore, there are probably other possible mechanisms involved in the trypanocidal activity of 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil against intracellular amastigotes, which are not involved in nitric oxide. Further studies should elucidate these mechanisms.
