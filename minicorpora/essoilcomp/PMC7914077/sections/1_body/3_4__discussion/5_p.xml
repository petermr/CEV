<p>The MIC of 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil displayed values between 50 and 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. Holetz et al. [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] classified samples with MIC values below 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL as presenting good antibacterial activity, from 100 to 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL as moderate activity, and from 500 to 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL as weak activity and those above 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL as inactive. Based on this, the essential oil analyzed in this study exhibited good inhibitory activity against the 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain and moderate activity against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Eugenol demonstrated moderate activity against all the strains in the present study. When our data was compared with previous work, it was observed that a Brazilian eugenol-rich clove essential oil had MIC value of 60 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for the 
 <italic>E.coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], a result close to that found in our study for the Gram-positive strain, while a clove essential oil with more than 90% eugenol resulted in MIC of 1,318 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for 
 <italic>E.coli</italic> [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Eugenol was analyzed against an 
 <italic>E.coli</italic> strain and exhibited 3,284 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and 1,600 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL MIC values [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Different results from those found in the present study may be related to the type of bacterial culture used. Eugenol was evaluated against standard strains and clinical isolates of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> presenting MIC value of 256 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for the standard strain, while the other 25 strains had MIC values ranging from 128 to 512 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].
