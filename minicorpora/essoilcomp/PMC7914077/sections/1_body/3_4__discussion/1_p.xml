<p>This research studied the chemical composition and antimicrobial, antioxidant, and antitrypanosomal activity of 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil, describing for the first time its activity against intracellular amastigotes of 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> and its inhibitory effect on 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic>-stimulated peritoneal macrophages. The physical-chemical parameters (color, appearance, solubility, density, and refractive index) were evaluated to ensure the integrity and quality of the essential oil, as environmental factors (light, heat, air, and humidity) can influence the change in the chemotype of plant species. The physical characteristics of 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil were similar to the patterns described in previous studies [
