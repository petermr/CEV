 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil was active against standard strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, showing inhibition halo ranges between 14 and 25 mm by the disk diffusion test. These results agree with data from literature, in which a clove essential oil of more than 90% eugenol was more efficient against Gram-negative bacteria but showed smaller halos than those in our research for Gram-positive bacteria [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Another eugenol-rich clove essential oil presented inhibition zones of 28.3 and 28.1 mm for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, respectively, indicating the susceptibility of the bacteria to the essential oil [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The study by Cimanga et al. [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] used inhibition halo size (IHS) to classify antimicrobial activity as follows: IHS≥15 mm strong inhibition; 10≤IHS &lt;15 moderate inhibition; and IHS &lt;10 inactive. When the results of the present study are compared with literature, a pattern can be observed, with 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil being considered as strong inhibitor for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and a moderate inhibitor for 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.
