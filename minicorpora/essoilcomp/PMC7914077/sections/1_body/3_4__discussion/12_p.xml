<p>A similarity was observed between the inhibitory activities of 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil and eugenol against 
 <italic>T.</italic> cruzi epimastigote, and so activity against intracellular amastigotes was also analyzed. To our knowledge, this is the first description of 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil activity against 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> intracellular amastigote forms. As there is a lack of data about 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil activity against 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> intracellular amastigotes in literature, we found this activity similar to that observed against intracellular amastigotes of 
 <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> (15.24 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], a protozoa that belongs to the same Trypanosomatidae family of 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic>. Eugenol displayed better activity against the intracellular amastigotes than 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil. Parameters of infection analysis corroborated the intracellular amastigote results, showing that eugenol was able to decrease the number of amastigotes per 100 cells and the mean amastigotes per infected cells, while 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil only decreased amastigote numbers per 100 cells, although in a concentration inferior to that presented by eugenol.
