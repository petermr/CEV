<p>In the present study, the effects obtained when 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> was treated with clove essential oil showed that epimastigotes are more susceptible to treatment than intracellular amastigotes. The activity of 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil may be in part attributed to the presence of eugenol, which makes up over half its composition. Thus, in an attempt to identify the compound responsible for the activity observed in the essential oil, the eugenol was analyzed. Eugenol demonstrated antitrypanosomal activity when incubated with 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic>; however, due to its cytotoxicity on macrophages, eugenol becomes less selective than 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil.
