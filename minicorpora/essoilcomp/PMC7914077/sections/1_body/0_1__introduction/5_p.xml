<p>In view of the aforementioned research, the use of natural origin products as antimicrobials was evident. The exploration of the biological activity of chemical substances in medicinal plants constitutes a potential form of alternative disease control, generating the development of models that make the sustainable production systems and the conservation of biodiversity and natural resources feasible. Thus, this research aimed to study the chemical properties of the essential oil of
