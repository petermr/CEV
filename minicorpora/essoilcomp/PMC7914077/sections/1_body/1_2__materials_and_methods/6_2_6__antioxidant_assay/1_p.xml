<p>The determination of antioxidant activity was carried out according to the methodology suggested by Re et al., with modifications [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The test was carried out with a radical of ABTS which was prepared by the reaction of 5.0 mL of a 3.840 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL solution of ABTS with 88 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of the 37.840 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL potassium persulfate solution. The mixture was left in the dark at room temperature for 16 hours. Immediately after mixing, it was diluted in ethanol until an absorbance of 0.7 at 734 nm was obtained. In a dark environment, an aliquot of 30 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of each concentration of essential oil (200 to 15 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) and eugenol (90 to 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) was transferred in test tubes containing 3.0 mL of the radical cation ABTS and homogenized in a tube shaker, and after 6 minutes the absorbance of the reaction mixture was read on a spectrophotometer at a length of 734 nm. The tests were performed in triplicate, and the capture of the free radical was expressed as a percentage of inhibition (% I) of the ABTS radical cation according to the following equation: % inhibition = (absorbance of the solution of the ABTS radical - absorbance of the sample)/(ABTS absorbance radical solution) × 100 [
