<p>Trypomastigote forms of 
 <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> (SC2005 strain) were obtained from Vero cells infected and used to infect the macrophages. Epimastigote forms originated from the suspension of cell culture trypomastigotes in 3 mL of LIT medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL of penicillin, and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL of streptomycin and were incubated in an oven at 28°C until complete differentiation of parasites.
