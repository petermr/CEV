<p>The chemical characterization of the essential oil of the floral buds of 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> was determined by gas chromatograph coupled to Shimadzu QP5000 mass spectrometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), equipped with a capillary column ZB-5ms (5% phenyl arylene) 95% dimethylpolysiloxane, with HP 5MS electronic impact detector of 70 eV (40-500 Da) and transfer temperature of 280°C. Aliquots were injected in splitless mode with a volume of 0.3 µL in ethyl acetate (automatic injector CP-8410), fixing the following conditions: high purity helium as carrier gas; injector temperature maintained at 280°C, split mode (1 : 10); followed by an initial temperature of 40°C and a final temperature of 300°C, an initial time of 5 min and a final time of 7.5 min at 8/min.
