<p>The disk diffusion test was performed using the 75

 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL) seeded on Mueller–Hinton agar. Soon after, the disks containing 50 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of essential oil and eugenol were fixed on the agar surface. The plates were incubated in a bacteriological oven at 35°C for 24 hours. The diameters of the inhibition halos were measured, including the disk diameter, in triplicate [

 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> and eugenol was transferred to a test tube containing Mueller–Hinton broth. Then, serial dilutions were performed, resulting in concentrations of 1000, 500, 250, 200, 100, 75, 50, 25, 15, and 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. Microbial suspensions containing 1.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL were added at each concentration and incubated at 35°C for 24 h. After the incubation period, the MIC of the oil was determined, being defined as the lowest concentration that visibly inhibited bacterial growth (absence of visible turbidity) [
