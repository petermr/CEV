<p>Different concentrations, obtained by serial dilutions (1 : 2), of essential oils (1000–7.8 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) or benznidazole (200–0.78 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) up to a final volume of 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L per well were placed in 96-well plates with peritoneal macrophages (5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL). The controls were categorized as blank (wells with culture medium without cells), untreated control (cells and DMSO 1%), and reference drug (benznidazole). After 24 h, the cell viability was analyzed by the MTT colorimetric method [

 <sub>50</sub>) was calculated following the formula: CC
 <sub>50</sub> = (sample absorbance-blank absorbance)/(control absorbance-blank absorbance) × 100 [
