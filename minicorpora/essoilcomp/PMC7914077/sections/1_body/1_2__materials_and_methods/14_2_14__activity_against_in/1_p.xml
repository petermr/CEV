<p>Initially, trypomastigote forms of 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> from cultured Vero cells were obtained 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. BALB/c peritoneal macrophages, cultured in 24-well plates (5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) with coverslips, were infected with trypomastigotes using the ratio of parasite/cell 10 : 1, at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 6 h. Afterwards, well plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) to remove the noninternalized parasites. The infected cells were treated with different concentrations of 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil or eugenol (200–12.5 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL) for 24 h. For light microscopy analysis, the coverslips with the infected and treated cells were fixed with Bouin and stained with Giemsa's azur-eosin-methylene blue. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> was calculated from the total of intracellular amastigotes from 100 cells. The mean number of amastigotes per cell was obtained from the number of intracellular amastigotes in 100 cells divided by the number of infected cells. Benznidazole was used as the reference drug. The selectivity index (SI) was obtained from the ratio between cytotoxicity of BALB/c peritoneal macrophages and activity against intracellular amastigote (SI = CC
 <sub>50</sub>/IC
 <sub>50</sub>) [
