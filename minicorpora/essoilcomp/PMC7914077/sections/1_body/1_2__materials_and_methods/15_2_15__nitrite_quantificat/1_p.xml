<p>BALB/c peritoneal macrophages (5 × 10

 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil (200 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL) or eugenol (200 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL) and either stimulated or not stimulated with 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> trypomastigotes (5 × 10

 <italic>µ</italic>L of Griess reagent were added (25 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of sulfanilamide 1% in 2.5% H

 <sub>4</sub> solution and 25 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine 0.1% solution), followed by incubation in a dark environment for 10 minutes, and read at 570 nm on the spectrophotometer. The nitrite values were obtained from the standard curve of sodium nitrite (100–1.5
