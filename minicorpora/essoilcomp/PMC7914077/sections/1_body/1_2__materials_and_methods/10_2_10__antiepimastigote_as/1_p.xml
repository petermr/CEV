<p>Epimastigote forms of 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> (10
 <sup>6</sup> parasites/mL) from a 2–4-day-old culture were added to 96-well plates, followed by the addition of different concentrations of either 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil or eugenol (1000–7.81 µg/mL), obtained by serial dilutions (1 : 2), at a final volume of 100 
 <italic>µ</italic>L per well, for 72 hours. The controls were identified as follows: blank (wells without parasites), untreated control (parasites and DMSO 1%), and reference drug (benznidazole). With the aid of the hemocytometer and light microscopy, viability was evaluated by counting parasites, and the results were used to calculate the IC
 <sub>50</sub> (50% inhibition of parasite growth) following the formula: IC
 <sub>50</sub> = (sample counting)/(control counting) × 100 [
