<p>Analysis of the chemical composition of 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil identified eugenol as its major compound. 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil and eugenol inhibit the growth of Gram-positive bacteria 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and have antioxidant potential. Inhibitory activity against the epimastigotes and intracellular amastigotes of 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic>, associated with low cytotoxicity, demonstrated the selectivity of 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil against the parasite. In addition, the NO inhibition observed in 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic>-stimulated macrophages treated with 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil showed that there are probably other possible mechanisms involved in their trypanocidal activity, which are not related to NO. 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil trypanocidal activity provides optimism about its use in further research seeking new therapeutic alternatives to trypanosomiasis.
