  <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> has a diversity of biological activities due to the chemical compounds found in its plant products such as total phenolic compounds and flavonoids. The present work describes the chemical analysis and antimicrobial, antioxidant, and antitrypanosomal activity of the essential oil of 
  <italic>S. aromaticum</italic>. Eugenol (53.23%) as the major compound was verified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. 
  <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil was more effective against 
  <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MIC 50 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) than eugenol (MIC 250 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/mL). Eugenol presented higher antioxidant activity than 
  <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil, with an EC
  <sub>50</sub> of 12.66 and 78.98 
  <italic>µ</italic>g/mL, respectively. 
  <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil and eugenol exhibited 
  <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> inhibitory activity, with IC
  <sub>50</sub> of 28.68 ± 1.073 and 31.97 ± 1.061 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/mL against epimastigotes and IC
  <sub>50</sub> of 64.51 ± 1.658 and 45.73 ± 1.252 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/mL against intracellular amastigotes, respectively. Both compounds presented low cytotoxicity, with 
  <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil displaying 15.5-fold greater selectivity for the parasite than the cells. Nitrite levels in 
  <italic>T. cruzi</italic>-stimulated cells were reduced by essential oil (47.01%; 
  <italic>p</italic> = 0.002) and eugenol (48.05%; 
  <italic>p</italic> = 0.003) treatment. The trypanocidal activity of 
  <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil showed that it is reasonable to use it in future research in the search for new therapeutic alternatives for trypanosomiasis.
