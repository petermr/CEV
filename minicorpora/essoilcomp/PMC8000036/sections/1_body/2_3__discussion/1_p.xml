 <italic>Monarda citriodora</italic> and 
 <italic>M. fistulosa</italic> have been introduced throughout temperate regions of the world as popular herbal medicines as well as ornamentals [

 <xref rid="B5-plants-10-00482" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-plants-10-00482" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The volatile phytochemistry has shown wide variation depending on geographical location (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00482-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The essential oils of 
 <italic>M. citriodora</italic> in the present study were rich in both thymol and carvacrol, whereas essential oils from Europe and Asia were dominated by thymol with much lower concentrations of carvacrol. 
 <italic>Monarda fistulosa</italic>, in particular, showed wide variation with at least three different chemotypes (carvacrol-rich, thymol-rich, and geraniol-rich, see 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00482-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The essential oils of 
 <italic>M. fistulosa</italic> (samples #1 and #2) in this study fit into the thymol-rich chemotype. Interestingly, there was a high concentration of thymoquinone in 
 <italic>M. fistulosa</italic> sample #3, with concomitant lower concentrations of thymol and carvacrol. Thymol was reported as the major component of 
 <italic>M. punctata</italic> in two old reports [

 <xref rid="B12-plants-10-00482" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Consistent with these reports, a floral essential oil of 
 <italic>M. punctata</italic> from China was rich in thymol (75.2%), which is in agreement with the aerial parts essential oils from Alabama.
