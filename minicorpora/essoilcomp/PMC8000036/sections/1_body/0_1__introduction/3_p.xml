<p>Both 
 <italic>M. citriodora</italic> and 
 <italic>M. fistulosa</italic> are popular ornamentals and have been introduced to temperate locations around the world [

 <xref rid="B5-plants-10-00482" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-plants-10-00482" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Geographical location likely plays an important role in the phytochemistry of 
 <italic>Monarda</italic> species. To our knowledge, however, there have been no previous examinations of 
 <italic>M. citriodora</italic>, 
 <italic>M. fistulosa</italic>, or 
 <italic>M. punctata</italic> growing in their native range of south Alabama. In this work, we have examined the chemical compositions and enantiomeric distributions of essential oils of the three 
 <italic>Monarda</italic> species from south Alabama.
