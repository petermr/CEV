<p>Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010S, Restek B-Dex 325 column, GC oven temperature 50 °C–120 °C (1.5 °C/min) then 120 °C–200 °C (2.0 °C/min), 0.1 μL injection of 5% solution of EO in dichloromethane (split mode, 45:1). The enantiomeric distributions were determined by comparison of retention times with authentic samples obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI, USA). Relative enantiomer percentages were calculated from peak areas.</p>
