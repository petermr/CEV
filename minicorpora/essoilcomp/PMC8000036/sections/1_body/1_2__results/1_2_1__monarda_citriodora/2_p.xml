<p>Chiral gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the 
 <italic>M. citriodora</italic> essential oils revealed the (+)-enantiomers to be the major stereoisomers for α-thujene, α-pinene, β-pinene, α-phellandrene, δ-3-carene, α-terpinene, 
 <italic>cis</italic>-sabinene hydrate, 
 <italic>trans</italic>-sabinene hydrate, α-terpineol, α-copaene, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-caryophyllene, and germacrene D. On the other hand, the (−)-enantiomer was dominant for β-phellandrene, borneol, carvone, and δ-cadinene. Limonene showed variation in the enantiomeric distributions with (+)-limonene in 26.7%, 63.3%, and 57.3% for aerial parts #1, #2, and roots essential oils, respectively. Likewise, linalool also showed variation with (+)-linalool of 71.9%, 49.7%, and 50.1%. (+)-Terpinen-4-ol was the predominant enantiomer in the aerial parts essential oils (60.2% and 58.5%), but (−)-terpinen-4-ol (79.1%) was dominant in the root essential oil.
