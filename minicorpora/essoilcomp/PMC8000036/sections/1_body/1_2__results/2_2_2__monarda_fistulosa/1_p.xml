 <italic>Monarda fistulosa</italic> essential oils were obtained in 2.66â€“4.83% yields as bright orange oils. The chemical compositions of the essential oils from the aerial parts of 
 <italic>M. fistulosa</italic> are summarized in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00482-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. In samples #1 and #2, thymol (RI
 <sub>db</sub> = 1289) dominated the compositions (54.3% and 62.2%, respectively) with lesser quantities of 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (RI
 <sub>db</sub> = 1024, 12.1% and 10.2%), limonene (RI
 <sub>db</sub> = 1030, 6.1% and 3.7%), carvacrol (RI
 <sub>db</sub> = 1296, 5.9% and 6.6%), and thymoquinone (RI
 <sub>db</sub> = 1252, 8.4% and 2.3%). Curiously, sample #3, although qualitatively similar, had a very different quantitative composition with thymoquinone as the most abundant constituent (41.3%) followed by 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (21.9%), but with lower concentrations of thymol (8.9%) and carvacrol (1.6%).
