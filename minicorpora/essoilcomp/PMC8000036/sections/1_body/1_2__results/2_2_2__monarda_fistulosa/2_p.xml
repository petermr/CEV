<p>As was observed in 
 <italic>M. citriodora</italic> essential oils, in 
 <italic>M. fistulosa</italic> essential oils, the (+)-enantiomer was the major for α-thujene, α-pinene, β-pinene, α-phellandrene, δ-3-carene, α-terpinene, 
 <italic>cis</italic>-sabinene hydrate, 
 <italic>trans</italic>-sabinene hydrate, α-terpineol, α-copaene, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-caryophyllene, and germacrene D, while the (−)-enantiomer was predominant for β-phellandrene and borneol. (−)-Limonene (97.4–99.5%) and (−)-linalool (62.1–62.5%) dominated in all three 
 <italic>M. fistulosa</italic> samples. (+)-Camphene (100%), (+)-sabinene (58.4–59.0%), and (+)-terpinen-4-ol (63.2–63.3%) were also dominant.
