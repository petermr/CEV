<p>This study presents, for the first time, analyses of the essential oils of three species of 
 <italic>Monarda</italic> growing in south Alabama. In addition, the enantiomeric distribution of terpenoids was also carried out. This work illustrates the wide variation in essential oil compositions based on geographical location as well as variations in enantiomeric distribution. It would be interesting to compare enantiomeric distributions for 
 <italic>Monarda</italic> essential oils from other geographical locations and for other 
 <italic>Monarda</italic> species. Nevertheless, the phenolic monoterpenoids thymol and/or carvacrol were found to dominate the compositions of 
 <italic>M. citriodora</italic>, 
 <italic>M. fistulosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>M. punctata</italic> and support the traditional medicinal uses of these plants.
