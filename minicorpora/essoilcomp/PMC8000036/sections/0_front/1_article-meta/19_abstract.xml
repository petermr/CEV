 <p>The genus 
  <italic>Monarda</italic> (family Lamiaceae) contains 22 species of which three are native to southern Alabama, 
  <italic>M. citriodora</italic>, 
  <italic>M. fistulosa</italic>, and 
  <italic>M. punctata</italic>. Several species of 
  <italic>Monarda</italic> have been used in traditional medicines of Native Americans, and this present study is part of an ongoing project to add to our understanding of Native American pharmacopeia. Plant material from 
  <italic>M. citriodora, M. fistulosa</italic>, and 
  <italic>M. punctata</italic> was collected in south Alabama and the essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation. The essential oils were analyzed by gas chromatographic techniques to determine the chemical compositions as well as enantiomeric distributions. The compounds thymol, carvacrol, 
  <italic>p</italic>-cymene, and their derivatives were the primary terpenoid components found in the essential oils. The known biological activities of these compounds are consistent with the traditional uses of 
  <italic>Monarda</italic> species to treat wounds, skin infections, colds, and fevers.
