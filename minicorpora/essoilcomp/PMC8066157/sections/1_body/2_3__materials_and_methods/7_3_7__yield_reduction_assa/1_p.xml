<p>MDBK cells wereplated in 24-well plates (6 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells per well). Subsequently, the BVDV inoculum was prepared at an m.o.i. of 0.1 and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Then, the virus-containing medium was replaced with a minimum essential medium (E-MEM) supplemented with 1% of horse serum and the compound. After 72 h, supernatants were collected and TCID
 <sub>50</sub> titers were quantified by the Reed and Muench endpoint titration method.
