<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="pathogens-10-00403">Table S1</xref>, there were no cytotoxic effects on cell lines evaluated in 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (CC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 100 µg/mL). The essential oils investigated did not show antiviral activity against HIV-1 or representatives of Negative-strand RNA viruses (ss-RNA)-viruses (hRSV, VSV) with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 100 µg/mL. In the group of viruses chosen as representative of ss-RNA
 <sup>+</sup> viruses (DENV-2, WNV, YFV, CV-B5, poliovirus Sb-1), essential oils were not endowed with great effects, with the only exception being on BVDV. Indeed, 
 <italic>Salvia officinalis</italic> L. was shown to have moderate antiviral activity on BVDV (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 50 ± 3 µg/mL). The essential oil was characterized, and the major constituents are shown in
