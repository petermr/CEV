<p>No component tested on the MDBK cell line showed toxic effects at the concentrations evaluated. 
 <italic>Trans-E-caryophyllene</italic> and 
 <italic>α-humulene</italic> resulted in the only constituents endowed with antiviral activity, showing EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 90 µM and 36 µM, respectively. These results prompted us to investigate 
 <italic>α-humulene</italic> as the main active component (
