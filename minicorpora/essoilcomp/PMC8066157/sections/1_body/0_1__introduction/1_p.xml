<p>Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is a small, enveloped virus with a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome belonging to the genus Pestivirus in the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family. BVDV is the etiological agent of serious diseases in cattle and other ruminants [

 <xref rid="B2-pathogens-10-00403" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-pathogens-10-00403" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Infection by BVDV induces a range of clinical manifestations including respiratory problems, gastroenteric diseases, and reproductive diseases. There are two biotypes: cytopathic (CP) and non-cytopathic (NCP). CPs are related to mucosal diseases with ulceration of the gastrointestinal tract, diarrhea, and dehydration up to the death of the subject, while the NCP biotype is related to persistent infection (PI) [

 <xref rid="B5-pathogens-10-00403" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Animals exhibiting PI remain viremic for life and serve as persistent reservoirs of viruses [
 <xref rid="B6-pathogens-10-00403" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. PI by BVDV in a pregnant cow can result in a wide range of clinical manifestations, such as resorption; abortion; mummification; or in case of fetuses who survive early infection, may be abnormally formed, blind, or with skeletal defects, weak immune system, respiratory problems, or have an underdeveloped brain [
