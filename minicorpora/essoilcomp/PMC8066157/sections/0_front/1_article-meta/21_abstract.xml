 <p>Plant products provide an alternative and successful source of lead compounds for the pharmaceutical industry. The present study was aimed to evaluate, in cell-based assays, the antiviral properties of essential oils obtained from plants that commonly grow in Sardinia, Italy, against a broad spectrum of RNA/DNA viruses. The essential oils of 
  <italic>Helichrisumitalicum</italic> (Roth) G. Don ssp. 
  <italic>microphyllum</italic> (Willd.) Nyman, 
  <italic>Laurus nobilis</italic> L., 
  <italic>Mirtuscommunis</italic> L., 
  <italic>Pistacia lentiscus</italic> L., 
  <italic>Salvia officinalis</italic> L., 
  <italic>Saturejathymbra</italic> L., 
  <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic> Mill., 
  <italic>Foeniculum vulgare</italic> Mill., and 
  <italic>Eucalyptus globulus</italic> Labill. were extracted by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Interestingly, the essential oil of 
  <italic>Salvia officinalis</italic> showed moderate activity against bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), an enveloped RNA virus belonging to the 
  <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family. BVDV is responsible for several clinical manifestations in bovines, including respiratory, gastroenteric, and reproductive diseases, with a significant economic impact. With the aim to individuate the constituent of the 
  <italic>Salvia officinalis</italic> responsible for the biological activity, we tested the major components of the oil: camphene, β-pinene, limonene, 1,8-cineole, cis-thujone, camphor, (E)-caryophyllene, and α-humulene. Here, we describe α-humulene as an active component that is non-cytotoxic and active against BVDV (EC
  <sub>50</sub> = 36 µM). Its antiviral effects were evaluated using virucidal cytopathic effect inhibition and viral yield reduction assays. This is the first scientific report showing the anti BVDV effects of 
  <italic>Salvia officinalis</italic> essential oil and α-humulene as the main active component.
