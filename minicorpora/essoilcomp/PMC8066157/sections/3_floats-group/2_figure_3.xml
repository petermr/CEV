  <p>Virucidal activity of α-humulene. BVDV suspensions were incubated with title compound (100 µM) at 4 and 37 °C for 2 h, and then the remaining infectivity was determined. Results are expressed as titer reduction in compound-treatedsamples compared to non-treated samples. Each value represents the mean of duplicate assays ± standard deviation.</p>
