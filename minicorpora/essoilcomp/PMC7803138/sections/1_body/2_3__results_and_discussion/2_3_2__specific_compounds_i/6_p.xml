<p>The varying reports of the volatile composition of the same plants from the findings of other previous studies conducted in different countries were attributed to differences in geographical location which affected the agroecological conditions and hence the biochemical composition [

 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Other causes of such diversity may include the nature of chemotypes [

 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], harvesting stage of the tested plants, plant parts from which the oil is extracted [

 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], soil type and its nutrient status [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], climatic conditions under which the plants were grown, method of harvesting, and oil extraction method [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The time of the year that the plant material was harvested to extract the oil may also determine the concentration of the essential oil compounds [
