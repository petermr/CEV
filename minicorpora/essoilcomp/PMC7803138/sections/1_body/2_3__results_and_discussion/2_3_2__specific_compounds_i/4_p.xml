<p>In garlic, the major compound was identified as allyl(Z)-prop-1-enyl trisulfide (4.30%), which is an organosulfur, followed by 2-((2R,4aR,8aS)-4a-methyl-8-methylenedecahydronaphthalen-2-yl)-prop-2-en-1-ol (3.93%), which is a terpene, and longifolenaldehyde (3.86%), which is a carbaldehyde. Others were nerolidol (3.63%), which is a terpene and (E)-1-methyl-2-(prop-1-en-1-yl) disulfane (3.40%), which is an organosulfur (

 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] who reported that terpenes were rare in garlic essential oil, and in most cases, only little amounts of monoterpene hydrocarbons such as sabinene and limonene are present. In our study, two terpene compounds were among the major compounds identified in garlic oil, while sabinene and limonene were not detected at all. In fact, our study identified a total of 37 terpenes in garlic making them the most abundant compounds followed by organosulfurs (21) and esters (18). This observation thus contradicted that of Rao et al. [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and Abu-Lafi et al. [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] who reported that garlic oil had more sulfur compounds than terpenes. The high detection of terpenes in garlic essential oils in our study can be attributed to fresh extraction. Drying of garlic before extraction of essential oil has been reported as one major cause of loss of terpenes from the essential oil [
