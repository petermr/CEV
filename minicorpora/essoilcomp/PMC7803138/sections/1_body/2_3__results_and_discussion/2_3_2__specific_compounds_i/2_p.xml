<p>The major compounds identified in the Mexican marigold essential oil in this study were chrysantenyl 2-methuylbutanoate (3.07%), which is an ester, papaveroline, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-3-O-methyl- (3.02%), which was an alkaloid, 3,5-dimethylanisole (3.01%), which is an aromatic hydrocarbon, t-butylhydroquinone (2.96%), which is a hydroquinone, and dodecanoic acid (2.85%), which is an ester (
