<p>The major organosulfurs that were identified in this study were similar to those identified by other researchers [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. They included allyl(Z)-prop-1-enyl-trisulfide (4.30%), (E)-1-methyl-2-(prop-1-en-1-yl) disulfane (3.40%), and diallylsulphide (2.94%) among many others. The organosulfur compounds are said to be antifungal, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, antidiabetic, cardioprotective, and neuroprotective [

 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Therefore, garlic is a high value crop with potentially high utility in medical, agrochemical, and food industries. Roberta and Guido [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] also identified E-E farnesal in garlic essential oil, but in our study, this compound was only found in ginger essential oil.
