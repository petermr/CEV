<p>Further analysis of the identified chemical classes showed that their specific composition varied among the test plants. 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table"> Table 2</xref> shows the composition of the five major specific compounds in each of the four test plants. This study identified bicyclogermacrene and 3-carene (terpenes), cholesterol (steroid), (1R, 7S, E)-7-Isopropyl-4,10-dimethylenecyclodec-5-enol (alkenol), and bicyclo[5.2.0]nonane,2-methylene-4,8,8-trimethyl-4-vinyl-(cycloalkane) as the major compounds in tick berry (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Contrary to this observation, the essential oils obtained from the leaves and flowers of tick berry in Cameroon and Madagascar contained curcumene (24.7%), ᵦ-caryophyllene (13.3%), and davanone (15.9%) as the major compounds [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The first two are terpenes, while the third one is a ketone. In our study, curcumene was not detected in tick berry, while caryophyllene and davanone were available at relatively low amounts of 0.16% and 0.13%, respectively. Silva et al. [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] also reported that essential oil of tick berry from north Brazil contained limonene, 
 <italic>α</italic>-phellandrene, germacrene D, and zingiberene as the major compounds. We also identified 
 <italic>α</italic>-phellandrene and germacrene D in tick berry essential oil but no zingiberene and limonene. Bicyclogermacrene, germacrene D, and 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene have been reported as chemical markers of lantana species [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, we found bicyclogermacrene and 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene to be present also in the other tested plants, while only 0.20% of germacrene D was detected.
