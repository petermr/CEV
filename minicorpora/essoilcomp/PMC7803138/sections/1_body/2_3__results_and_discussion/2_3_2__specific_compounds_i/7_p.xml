<p>The study further revealed the most common compounds that were present in the essential oils of all the tested plants as shown in 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The majority were terpenes (5), followed by alkanes (2), while carbaldehydes, phthalates, and esters had one compound each that was common in all the four plants. The most abundant terpenes included bicyclogermacrene, 3- careen, and citral, which were most abundant in tick berry (

 <italic>γ</italic>-hexalactone (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The findings of this study therefore corroborate with earlier reports from other studies that state that terpenes are by far the most dominant constituents of essential oils [
