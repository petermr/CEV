<p>The major compound in ginger essential oil was corymbolone (3.59%) belonging to the family of ketones, followed by zingiberene (3.54%) and bicyclogermacrene (3.49%), which is a terpene. Others were 4,4-dimethyl octane (3.21%), which is an alkane, and cis-2-norbornanol (3.08), which is a cycloalkanol (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These findings partially corroborate with some earlier reports from other studies and at the same time contradicte other reported findings. For example, zingiberene was reported as the major constituent of ginger oil in India [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and Mauritius [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, hydro-distilled ginger essential oil from a 10-month-old ginger rhizome cultivated in North east India did not contain any zingiberene [

 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] found curcumene to be the major constituent of steam-distilled ginger oil in India, while citral was reported as the major constituent of ginger oil in Central Africa Republic [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In our study, only 1.13% of
