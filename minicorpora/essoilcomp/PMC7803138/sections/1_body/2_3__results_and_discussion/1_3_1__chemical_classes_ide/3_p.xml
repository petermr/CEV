<p>The percent composition of the different chemical classes in the essential oils of the tested plants was found to vary among the test plants. Ginger essential oil had the highest amount of terpenes (42.18%), followed by garlic (39.57%), tick berry (37.26%), and Mexican marigold (20.94%). Although ginger and garlic, which are majorly spices, were found to contain high levels of terpenes, the compound reportedly contributed less to flavour and fragrance of the essential oils [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Mexican marigold had the highest amount of esters (14.01%) and relatively high amount of ketones (8.93%) and alkanols (4.73%). Ginger had the highest composition of ketones (8.99%) and fatty acids (3.67%) and relatively high amount of alkanes (7.42%) and cycloalkanols (4.13%). Garlic recorded the highest composition of organosulfur (15.01%), aromatic hydrocarbons (6.36%), carbonates (3.71%), and carbaldehyde (3.85%). Garlic also had a relatively high amount of fatty acids (3.61%). Tick berry had the highest composition of alkanes (7.55%), cycloalkane (7.31), steroid (7.08%), alkanols (5.12%), alkenols (5.73%), and aldehydes (4.67%) as shown in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The composition of other minor compounds with average composition of &lt;1% also varied among the test plants and were found to be present in either three, two, or one out of the four plants that were analysed except organic acids and phthalates, which were present in all the plants.
