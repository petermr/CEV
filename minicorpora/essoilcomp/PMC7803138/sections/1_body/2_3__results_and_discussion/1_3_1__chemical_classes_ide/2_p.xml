<p>There were 18 major classes that were identified with average percent chemical composition of &gt;1% as shown in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Terpenes constituted the highest composition in the essential oils of all the tested plants. These results also corroborate with those of Swamy et al. [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and Matos et al. [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], who reported that terpenes constitute about 50â€“95% of the essential oils. Dhifi et al. [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] also reported that terpenes constitute the majority of chemical classes in essential oils of various plants. Murugesan et al. [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] also revealed that tick berry essential oils from Tamil Nadu region in India had more terpenes than other compounds. Other major chemical classes identified in this study included esters, ketones, organosulfurs, alkanes, cycloalkanes, steroids, aromatic hydrocarbons, alkanols, cycloalkanols, alkenols, carbonates, fatty acids, carbaldehyde, aldehydes, alkenes, ethers, carboxylic acid, alkaloids, and organic acids listed in order of abundance (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The listed classes were present in relatively higher abundance either in all or at least three of the tested plants. Dhifi et al. [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] also reported that, apart from terpenes, essential oils also contain various chemical classes including alcohols, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, esters, amines, amides, and phenols.
