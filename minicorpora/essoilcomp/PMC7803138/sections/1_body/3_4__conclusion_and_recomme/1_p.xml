<p>It can be concluded that the chemical composition of the essential oils of ginger, garlic, tick berry, and Mexican marigold has a remarkable variation attributable to the species' genetic variation and probably the ecological conditions under which these plants are grown. Some of the compounds identified in this study such as terpenes have unutilized potential in biopesticides, pharmaceutical, and food industries. Therefore, industrial extraction and purification of the essential oils in these plants is recommended. The four tested plants were found to have some common chemical compounds and can therefore be exploited for synergistic utility.</p>
