<p>Steam distillation method has been used widely for commercial extraction of essential oils [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, it is difficult to control the heat transfer throughout the extraction process and the extraction time using steam distillation [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In addition, steam distillation extracts up to 93% of the essential oil [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In order to increase the content of essential oils extracted, this study utilized a new design of steam distillation developed by Masango [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] that reduces the loss of polar compounds in waste water. The plant material is placed above the water such that it is not in contact with the water, but the steam from heated water passes through it and extracts water-soluble compounds, which are then dissolved in the aqueous fraction at a lower extent [

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Consequently, GC-MS has of late been widely used in chromatographic fingerprinting of medicinal plants [
