<p>There are different methods of essential oil extraction such as steam distillation and low temperature distillation for those compounds that require low temperatures [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and hydrodistillation and extraction with solvents [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The method of extraction determines the quality of essential oil. Inappropriate extraction procedures can lead to damage or change of the chemical nature of the essential oil [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Many natural products are thermally unstable and can easily be damaged during thermal extraction [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The method of extraction used depends on the kind of compounds present in the oil and the location of the oils within the vegetative structure of the plant species [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].
