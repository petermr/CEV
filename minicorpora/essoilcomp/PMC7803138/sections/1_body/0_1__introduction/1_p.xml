<p>Essential oils are secondary metabolites that plants produce for protection from pests and predators, attraction of pollinators, or seed dispersal [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The oils are located in different parts of the plant such as roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits, and even in seeds depending on the plant species [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In these plant parts, the essential oil is accumulated in cells, secretory cavities, or glandular hairs [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Almost every part of a plant can produce essential oil, which can be extracted and exploited in various industrial ways [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The essential oils are highly volatile [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], transparent, and lipid-soluble liquids [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. They are soluble in organic solvents such as benzene, toluene, acetone, ethanol, and methanol that have less density compared with water [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].
