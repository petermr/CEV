 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] reported that ginger oil composition varied with the geographical origin of the plant. According to Fakim et al. [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], zingiberene was found to vary in quantity from different countries where ginger was growing. In India, zingiberene quantity in the essential oil was 46.2%, 38.12% in China, 29.0% in Nigeria, 20â€“28% in Australia, 9.5% in Mauritius, 3.6% in Central African Republic, and 1.5% in Srilanka. Different growth stages of the plants also bring about variations in the essential oil composition within the same organ of the plant [
