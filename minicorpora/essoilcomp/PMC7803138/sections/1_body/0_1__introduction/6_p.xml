<p>Bioactive compounds present in essential oils have been found to act as biopesticides locally, but they are not adequately utilized by commercial industries. Alternatively, herbal plants that produce essential oils have been utilized as remedies of various problems without knowledge of their quality or chemical composition [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] though with lesser side effects [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It is therefore necessary to analyse the composition of the volatile components of essential oils of different plants for the purpose of separating individual compounds that may have different uses in different industries. This study was aimed at extracting essential oils from garlic (
