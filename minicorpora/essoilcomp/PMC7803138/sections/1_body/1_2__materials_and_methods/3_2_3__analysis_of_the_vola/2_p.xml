<p>The analysis followed the modified procedure described by Omolo et al. [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The analysis started after 3.95 minutes (solvent delay). The GC condition had an initial oven temperature of 40°C maintained for 3 minutes. The temperature was then gradually increased with gradients of 10°C/minute up to 60°C, 5°C/minute up to 90°C, and 4°C/minute up to 250°C and maintained there for 8 minutes. Subsequent GC working conditions utilized hydrogen gas with a constant flow of 1 ml/minute as the carrier gas and n-hexane as matrix solvent. The MS working conditions comprised of an ion source and transfer line temperature maintained at 300°C, a regime of injection split in a ratio of 15 : 1, a split flow of 22.5 mL/minute, and a mass range of 20–300 m/z. The injection was done with a 10
