<p>Gas chromatograph (GC) Agilent 7890B with autosampler was used to analyse the composition of the volatile components of essential oils extracted from ginger, garlic, tick berry, and Mexican marigold. Mass spectrometry (MS) detector Agilent 5977A was an integral part of the gas chromatograph. The GC-MS records were processed by means of GC-MS ChemStation software. The GC was equipped with a mass selective detector (MSD), an autosampler, and a highly polar DB-wax capillary column (length 30.0 mx; inner diameter 0.25 mmx; inner film thickness 0.25
