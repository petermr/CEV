<p>Extraction of essential oils was done following a modified procedure described by Adams [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and adopted by Mugao et al. [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Vertical steam distillation unit, consisting of a hot plate, boiling flask, biomass flask, still head, condenser, and receiving flask (separating funnel), was used for dry steam distillation of plant material. The fresh materials of each plant were put separately in the biomass flask, and the distillation unit was switched on. Steam was produced in the boiling flask by heating distilled water with the hot plate. The steam moved upward into the biomass flask where essential oils and other water-soluble plant compounds were moved as vapour through the still head, condensed in the water-cooled condenser, and collected in the receiving flask (separating funnel). The receiving flask separated the heavier-than-water oils from the lighter-than-water oils while allowing excess water-soluble compounds to be drained out and collected separately. The obtained essential oil samples were dried to remove any water molecules by passing them in anhydrous sodium sulphate (Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>) and then stored in sealed vials at 4Â°C awaiting the GC-MS analysis of the chemical compounds.
