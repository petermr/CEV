<p>Fresh tick berry and Mexican marigold leaves were collected from the field at the University of Embu farm in the year 2019, while ginger rhizomes and garlic bulbs were obtained from the local open air market. One kilogram each of tick berry and Mexican marigold leaves were washed under tap water, rinsed in three changes of distilled water, and then air-dried in the laboratory at room temperature (25Â°C) to evaporate the moisture content. One kilogram each of garlic cloves and ginger rhizomes were also washed with tap water and then rinsed with three changes of distilled water. The test materials were also air-dried in the laboratory and later peeled to remove the outer coverings.
