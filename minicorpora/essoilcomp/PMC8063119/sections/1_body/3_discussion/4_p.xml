<p>Regarding the contained VOC profiles, green leaf volatiles (GLVs) generated by the lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway such as 2-hexenal constitute the major compounds. Due to the extraction protocol, this profile may not be interpreted as a potential pool for VOC emissions in the environment, as 
 <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis could have occurred during incubation and trapping after grinding, especially for GLV. DHS is the most widely used sampling approach in the plant field because of its flexibility (sampled volume, trapping approaches and materials) (

However, the analysis of these contained profiles may prove useful to further establish the metabolomic impact of EOs injection into apple trees. The presence of greater amounts of other aldehydes, such as nonanal, and the plant volatile hormone methyl salicylate reinforces the previously formulated hypothesis of resistance induction (
