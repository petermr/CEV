<p>In terms of agricultural application, trunk injection and EO applications are rarely used (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Aćimović et al., 2020</xref>). This work was established as a proof of concept that the combination of both may be a suitable strategy to develop the biopesticidal potential of EOs whilst avoiding most of their drawbacks. However, we must highlight that more works in terms of reproducibility of results over different years, with other apple varieties, rootstock and efficiency on diverse pests are needed to establish the agronomic potential of such treatment. The absence of impact on apple quality or yield and on tree growth through long-term phytotoxicity should be established as well. Field trials should be performed to establish efficacy as a biopesticide and the lack of harmful effect to beneficial insects.
