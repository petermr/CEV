<p>Our work did not express foliar phytotoxicity. Chlorophyll fluorescence is a non-destructive and sensitive method that is widely used in eco-physiological studies to assess abiotic stress in plants. Indeed, perturbation in plant metabolism may decrease photosystem II (PSII) performance. However, local toxicity at the injection site cannot be excluded, as well as the mechanical damage that occurs due to the injection procedure (

Physiological disorder in phytohormones or ROS balances that may result in chronic and long-term toxicity from EO applications should be addressed before concluding a lack of harmful effects of the treatments.
