<p>The results presented in this work clearly exposed the possibility that EO application could trigger different physiological processes within plants, leading to other BVOC emissions. Some compound production seems to be shared for both EOs, whereas some seem to be specifically induced by each EO. These results support the hypothesis of different modes of action for each EO and further demonstrated the plantâ€™s reaction to these EO injections. The differences between the two EO profiles may result from their specific interactions with the plant and, more precisely, with the plasma membrane. Recently, molecular techniques of dynamic interaction were applied to study the interaction between a biomimetic membrane with monoterpene (citronellal and citronellol) and with cinnamaldehyde (phenylpropanoids). Briefly, the 
 <italic>in silico</italic> insertion model predicted different behaviours between the two classes (monoterpenes and phenylpropanoids), which are the stable interactions with plant lipids for monoterpene, whilst 
 <italic>trans</italic>-cinnamaldehydes had no stable interaction with the membrane. These predictions were confirmed using 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> biophysical assays (
