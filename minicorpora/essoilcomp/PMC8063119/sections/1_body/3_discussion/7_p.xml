<p>Plant VOCs are a promising tool, as they have numerous applications in agriculture, such as parasitoid attractant or through defence induction or priming, growth regulators and abiotic stress protectants (

Furthermore, the variations in the emitted and contained VOCs clearly demonstrate that young apple trees react to EO injection and that this reaction may be explored to design sustainable agricultural practices.
