<p>In addition to the established systemic circulation of carvone and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-cinnamaldehyde, it is most interesting to look at the modification of other VOCs in the emission profiles that can strongly impact trophic interaction within ecosystems. BVOC emissions can mediate herbivore interactions (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">Trowbridge and Stoy, 2013</xref>). Within the framework of this discussion, one should bear in mind that numerous factors can influence apple tree VOC emissions, including meteorological (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Vallat et al., 2005</xref>), circadian (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Giacomuzzi et al., 2017</xref>), physiological (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Zeng et al., 2017</xref>), and phonological (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Casado et al., 2006</xref>), as well as interactions with herbivores (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Suckling et al., 2012</xref>) or fungi (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Souleyre et al., 2019</xref>). However, systemic release of induced volatiles also occurs in plants in the case of insect feeding to recruit natural enemies. The homoterpenes DMNT and TMTT, the monoterpenes ocimene and linalool and these squiterpenes farnesene and caryophyllene are a shared response to herbivores in diverse plant systems (

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Holopainen and Gershenzon, 2010</xref>). Therefore, modification of emitted VOCs, such as those observed in our work, may alter trophic interactions with regard to chemical ecology. Moreover, germacrene-D, α-farnesene and methyl salicylate may have resulted from SAR activation by the injected EOs, since SAR has been detected after trunk injection of SAR activators (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Aćimović et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, monoterpenes have been acknowledged to support SAR amongst different plants (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Riedlmeier et al., 2017</xref>). The elicitation of resistance in young apple trees by acibenzolar-S-methyl was observed to specifically increase the production of the compounds that were effective against rosy apple aphids and 
 <italic>Erwinia amylovora</italic> (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Aćimović et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">Warneys et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, 
 <italic>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic> oil and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-cinnamaldehyde were proven to be efficient against Alternaria brown spot in tangerine by direct effects and resistance induction (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Perina et al., 2019</xref>). A prospective molecular tool such as quantitative real-time PCR to detect changes in expression levels of genes involved in plant defence mechanisms may prove useful to challenge this hypothesis (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Dugé De Bernonville et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Aćimović et al., 2015</xref>). The plant defence responses include other mechanisms, such as cell wall fortification, antimicrobial compounds such as pathogenesis related (PR)protein productions, phytoalexins or reactive oxygen species (ROS) (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Marolleau et al., 2017</xref>). Phytoalexins include diverse plant secondary metabolites biosynthesised in response to pathogens and certain abiotic stresses. In the subtribe Malinae of the Rosaceae family, the phytoalexins biphenyl and dibenzofuranare are produced upon pathogen attack (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Chizzali and Beerhues, 2012</xref>) and after elicitor-treated cell cultures (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Saini et al., 2019</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">Teotia et al., 2019</xref>). The production of phytoalexins following treatment with EOs could also be an interesting prospect in order to determine and clarify the defence induction potential of these compounds as well as their potential impact on pathogens.
