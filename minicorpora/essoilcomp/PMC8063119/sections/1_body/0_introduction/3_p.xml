<p>Some of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) contained in EOs play a major role in plant defence mechanisms against bacteria, fungi, viruses, and herbivores (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Bakkali et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, much research has been performed to integrate these antibacterial, fungicidal, and insecticidal EOs as alternatives for sustainable agronomic practices, limiting environmental and health hazards. Indeed, due to their rapid degradation and since they are generally recognised as safe (GRAS), they represent an interesting alternative application of most synthetic conventional pesticides (

 <italic>Mentha spicata</italic> L.). They both present well-documented biopesticidal activity (
