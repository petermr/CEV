<p>The International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) defines an EO as a “product obtained from vegetable raw material, either by distillation with water or steam, or from the epicarp of citrus fruits by a mechanical process, or by dry distillations.” Due to their biological activity, they have long been applied in cosmetics, therapeutics, and food applications (

However, most of them belong to the terpenoids (mono- or sesqui-) or phenylpropanoids class of compounds, both of which have high lipophilicity and volatility, especially at room temperature. The secondary metabolites of EOs originate from methylerythritol phosphate and phenylalanine pathways (
