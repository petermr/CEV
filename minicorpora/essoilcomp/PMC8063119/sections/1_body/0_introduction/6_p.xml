<p>In the present study, we aimed to determine the distribution of trunk-injected EOs in young apple trees, thus proving their systemic movement by quantifying target VOCs, both within leaves and by aerial emissions. We also determined the impact of injected EOs on tree physiology by monitoring chlorophyll fluorescence and untargeted VOCs.</p>
