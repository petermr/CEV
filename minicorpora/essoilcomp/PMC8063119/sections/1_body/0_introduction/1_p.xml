<p>Apple 
 <italic>Malus domestica</italic> Borkh is the most cultivated fruit crop worldwide, reaching a production of 84.7 million tonnes in 2016 and representing a gross product value of US $ 45.8 billion (FAOSTAT). As any other plant, apple trees are subject to abiotic and biotic stresses that cause important economic losses. Apple trees suffer from fungal, viral and bacterial diseases; insects; mites; and nematodes (

 <italic>Dysaphis plantaginea</italic>, and the apple worm, 
 <italic>Cydia pomonella</italic>, are amongst the most serious apple pests (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Rousselin et al., 2017</xref>), whilst the main diseases are apple scab, powdery mildew, and fire blight caused by the fungi 
 <italic>Venturia inequalis</italic> and 
 <italic>Podosphaera leucotricha</italic> and by the bacteria 
 <italic>Erwinia amylovora</italic>, respectively (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Jamar et al., 2010</xref>). All these factors can impair production or marketable yields because apples do not fulfil the minimum quality criteria. Currently, the most applied delivery method for pest control is air-blast spray application of pesticides to the tree canopy (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Damos et al., 2015</xref>). However, pesticide off-target drift can lead to adverse effects on non-target organisms. Over the last 50 years, biodiversity has been reduced by up to 50% in European bird species and by 20â€“30% in British and German flora (

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Damalas and Eleftherohorinos, 2011</xref>). Additionally, pests can develop resistance to these pesticides, which usually contain a single active molecule (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Alins et al., 2017</xref>). Altogether, this suggests that the plant protection product (PPP) mode of application selection is an economic and ecological challenge around the world. As a result of the negative perception of synthetic pesticides, causing negative effects on human health during and after application, and fears of their excessive residues in or on fruit, consumer demand for agricultural products without synthetic pesticide residues from excessive phytosanitary treatments has increased. This is why alternative solutions have been investigated, such as biological pesticides or biopesticides. An abundant body of literature is published each year concerning the prospect of plant essential oils (EOs) as active ingredients in the production of biopesticides (
