<p>Leaf-contained VOCs were analysed by DHS-GC-MS. Before dynamic headspace sampling (DHS), the leaves were ground (A11 basic grinder, IKA WERKE, Staufenim Breisgau, Germany) with liquid nitrogen. Then, 1 g of freeze-grinded leaves was put in a 20 ml screw cap vial (Gerstel
 <sup>©</sup>, Mülheiman der Ruhr, Germany), and 2 ml of a 20% (w/v) NaCl solution was added to create a salting out effect (

 <sup>©</sup>, Mülheiman der Ruhr, Germany). The headspace was then dynamically transferred to a Tenax TA cartridge by applying 1,200 ml of nitrogen at a flow of 30 ml min
 <sup>–1</sup>. The cartridge was then drypurged at 50 ml min
 <sup>–1</sup> for 4 min. The cartridge was then sent to the thermal desorption unit (Thermal Desorption Unit TDU 2, Gerstel
 <sup>©</sup>, Mülheiman der Ruhr, Germany) for GC-MS analysis. The thermal desorption parameters used were the same as those described below for leaf-emitted VOCs. Tenax TA
 <sup>®</sup> porous polymers, based on 2,6-diphenyl-p-phenylene oxide, are widely used as an adsorbent in purge trap applications and plant headspace analysis due to their high versatility.
