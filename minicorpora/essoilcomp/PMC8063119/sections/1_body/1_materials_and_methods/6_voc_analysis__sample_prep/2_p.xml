<p>Leaf-emitted VOCs were analysed by TDU-GC-MS. Before thermal desorption, 1μl of 0.4 mg ml
 <sup>–1</sup> 1-phenyloctane (CAS 2189-60-8, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) in hexane was added to the cartridge by a multipurpose sampler (Multi-Purpose Sampler MPS, Gerstel
 <sup>©</sup>, Mülheiman der Ruhr, Germany). The addition of 1-phenyloctane as an internal standard (IS) allowed for semiquantification of the VOCs present on the cartridge. The VOCs were then thermally desorbed in the TDU and cryofocused in the cooled injection system (CIS) (Gerstel
 <sup>©</sup>, Mülheiman der Ruhr, Germany). The TDU temperature program was 40°C for 1 min and was increased to 280°C at a rate of 100°C min
 <sup>–1</sup> and held for 5 min. CIS was mounted with a baffled glass liner and operated in solvent vent mode, and the temperature program was -60°C for 0.10 min, which was increased to 250°C at a rate of 12°C s
 <sup>–1</sup> and held for 2 min following existing protocols (
