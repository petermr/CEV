<p>Detection and quantification of the major compounds of EO were performed in single-ion monitoring (SIM) mode. Based on the characterisation of the selected EOs, calibration curves in TDU-GC-MS using pure standards were established for each major component of the EO: (+)-carvone (CAS 2244-16-8, 99.9% purity, Supelco
 <sup>©</sup>, Missouri, United States) for mint and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-cinnamaldehyde (CAS 14371-10-9, ≥99% purity, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) for cinnamon oil. The 6-point calibration curves were established by injecting 1μl of the standard solution in hexane (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). For (+)-carvone, ions 108 and 93 were selected as qualifiers, and ion 82 was selected as he quantifier. A calibration curve (
 <italic>y</italic> = 0.527
 <italic>x</italic>+0.020, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.985) was established in triplicates between 1.50 and 861.05 μg ml
 <sup>–1</sup>. For 
 <italic>trans</italic>-cinnamaldehyde, ions 132 and 103 were used as the qualifier, and ion 131 was used as the quantifier. A calibration curve (
 <italic>y</italic> = 0.628
 <italic>x</italic>+0.018, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.989) was established in triplicates between 0.623 and 954.50 μg ml
 <sup>–1</sup>. The IS 1-phenyloctane was also used at a concentration of 400 μg ml
 <sup>–1</sup>.
