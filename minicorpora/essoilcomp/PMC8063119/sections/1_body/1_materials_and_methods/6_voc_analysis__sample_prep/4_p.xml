<p>For untargeted analysis, identification was based on comparison of the obtained spectra with the reference mass spectra from the NIST 17, Wiley 275 and pal 600 databases. Moreover, experimental retention indexes (RIs) were calculated using C
 <sub>7</sub>â€“C
 <sub>30</sub> solutions and compared to literature RIs. Technical grade standards were injected to ensure identification (
