<p>The analyses were carried out on a 7890A-5975C GC-MS equipped with an HP-5MS 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm capillary silica column (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, United States). The operating conditions were the following: helium flow of 1 ml min
 <sup>–1</sup> and oven temperature 40°C for 2 min, which was increased to 220°C at a rate of 5°C min
 <sup>–1</sup> and finally increased to 310°C at a rate of 15°C min
 <sup>–1</sup> and held for 3 min. The quadrupole and MS temperatures were 150 and 230°C, respectively. The MS ran in EI mode at an electron energy of 70 eV. Mass spectra were acquired in the range of 30–400 amu.
