<p>To facilitate injection and diffusion of EOs in the tree vascular tissue, a water-soluble, stable, and homogenous EO emulsion was prepared. To prepare 100 ml of the 0.5% (v/v) EO/water emulsion, 2 ml of Tween 80 (CAS 9005-65-6, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and 20 ml of 100 mM ethylene diaminete traacetic acid (EDTA) (Titriplex III, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) solution were added to 15 ml of water under constant agitation at 1,250 rpm. Water was then added to bring the final volume to 100 ml. After 5 min under constant agitation, the solution was then stabilised by high-speed homogenisation for 6 min at 9,500 rpm (Ultra-Turrax T25, IKA WERKE, Staufenim Breisgau, Germany) and by high-pressure homogenisation with eight cycles at 5,000 psi (FMC, Philadelphia, United States). The emulsion stability was checked by analysing the EO particle sizes and distribution in solution with a particle sizer (Beckman Coulter Delsa
 <sup>TM</sup> Nano C Particle Analyser, California, United States).
