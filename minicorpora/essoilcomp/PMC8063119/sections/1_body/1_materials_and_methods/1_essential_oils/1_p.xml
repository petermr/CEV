<p>The cinnamon EO (
 <italic>C. cassia</italic> J. Presl) and mint EO (
 <italic>M. spicata</italic> L.) used in this study were purchased from Pranarôm (Pranarôm &amp; Herbalgem, Ghislenghien, Belgium). Before formulation of the EOs, the oil composition was analysed by gas chromatography associated with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). These analyses were carried out on a 7890A-5975C GC-MS equipped with an HP-5MS 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm capillary silica column (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, United States). The operating conditions were the following: helium flow of 1.0 ml min
 <sup>–1</sup>; the oven temperature was programmed at 40°C for 2 min, increased to 100°C at a rate of 5°C min
 <sup>–1</sup>, increased to 120°C at a rate of 3°C min
 <sup>–1</sup>, held for 3 min, increased to 220°C at a rate of 5°C min
 <sup>–1</sup>, and finally increased to 310°C at a rate of 15°C min
 <sup>–1</sup>. One microliter of a 1 mg ml
 <sup>–1</sup> EO solution in hexane (HPLC grade, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) was injected in splitless mode. The injector, quadrupole and MS temperatures were 250, 150, and 230°C, respectively. The mass spectrometer (MS) ran in electron impact (EI) mode at an electron energy of 70 eV. Mass spectra were acquired in the range of 30–400 atomic mass units (amu).
