<p>The trees used in the experiment were drilled right above the grafting union with holes that were 1 mm wide and 1 cm deep. Three trunk injection ports per tree trunk were created and were positioned at an equal distance from each other (each 120° of trunk radius). Each injection port was slanted upward at a 60° angle in relation to the trunk axis (

 <sup>®</sup> safety lock 23G, Becton Dickinson, New Jersey, United States) were inserted into the ports and connected on the other side to drip bags (Baxter

The first two modalities were treated with EO emulsions (one with cinnamon oil and the other with mint oil), the third was a negative control (emulsion exempt of EOs) and the fourth was a blank treatment (no injection). To avoid cross-contamination, the treatments were delivered separately from each other at different times. Treatments were applied on different trees each time with a chamber ventilating period of 2 days.
