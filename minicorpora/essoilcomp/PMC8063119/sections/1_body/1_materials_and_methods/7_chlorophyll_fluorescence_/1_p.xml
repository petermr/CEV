<p>The potential phytotoxic effect of EOs on the photosynthetic efficiency of plants was evaluated by estimating the maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) with a fluorimeter (Handy PEA+, Hansatech Instruments Ltd., Norfolk, United Kingdom). For a healthy sample, this ratio is around 0.83 and lowers as plant stress increases, reaching 0.3 at the end of senescence (

 <italic>t</italic> = 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h for each modality tested). Fv/Fm was assessed on three leaves randomly selected on each tree. Before the measurement, the leaves were dark-adapted for 20 min using leafclips. Fv/Fm measurements were then performed by exposing the leaves to light intensity of 3,000 μmol m
