Sampling was performed by cutting the leaves at their base and dipping them into liquid nitrogen before storage at -80°C prior to dynamic headspace–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (DHS-GC-MS) analysis. A dry weight (DW) measurement was performed at the end of the experiment at 60°C until constant weight to obtain content results in ng g
