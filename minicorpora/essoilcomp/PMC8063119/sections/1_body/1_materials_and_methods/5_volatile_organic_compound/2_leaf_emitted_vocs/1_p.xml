<p>The headspace was sampled following the protocol for the volatile collection of aphid-infested leaves from an apple tree (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Stewart-Jones and Poppy, 2006</xref>). Briefly, two Tenax TA
 <sup>®</sup> 60/80 cartridges (Camsco
 <sup>©</sup>, Houston, United States) were attached to an inert polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bag (Nalophan
 <sup>®</sup>, Odometrics, Arlon, Belgium) enclosing a single branch. The trapping of emitted VOCs was performed by constant air sampling of 50 ml min
 <sup>–1</sup> using a Gilian air sampling pump (Sensidyne
 <sup>®</sup>, St. Petersburg, United States) attached to the other side of the cartridges (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Briefly, air enters the bag through the activated charcoal tube, loads in the VOCs and exits the bag through the Tenax TA cartridges, which capture VOCs. The bag and its connected cartridges were set up on each tree (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3) at 
 <italic>t</italic> = 0 h. The cartridges were then replaced at 
 <italic>t</italic> = 24, 48, 72, and 96 h and stored at −80°C prior to the GC-MS analysis. At the end of the experiment, all leaves enclosed in the bag were sampled and weighed. A DW measurement was also performed on these leaves at 60°C until constant weight to obtain results in ng g
