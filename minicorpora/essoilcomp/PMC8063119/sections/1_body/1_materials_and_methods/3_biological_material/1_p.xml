<p>Experiments were performed on 2-years-old apple trees (
 <italic>M. domestica</italic> Borkh, cv “Jonagold” grafted on M26 rootstock) obtained locally (Serres de Sauvenières, Gembloux, Belgium). The trees were 155 ± 15 cm high and presented a trunk diameter of 2 ± 0.2 cm above the graft union. During the experimental phase, the plants were placed in an environmental chamber with controlled environmental conditions [21 ± 0.5°C, 62 ± 10% relative air humidity and 16:8 h light/dark periods and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) of 50 μmol m
 <sup>2</sup> s
 <sup>–1</sup>]. Plants were watered every day with 500 ml of water. They developed fully expanded leaves but were free of flowers or fruit.
