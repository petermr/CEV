<p>Regarding mint EO, the main compound, carvone, was found in both the emission and in the leaves, as displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. The emission rate into the air was constant throughout the experiment at around 0.2 ng g

 <sup>–1</sup>. The leaf content, however, was more variable within and between 24 and 48 h. Indeed, the carvone content varied between 3.39 and 19.7 ng g
