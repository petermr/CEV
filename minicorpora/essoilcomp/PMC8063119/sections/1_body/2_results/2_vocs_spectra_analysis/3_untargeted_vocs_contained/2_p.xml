<p>VOC profiles for EO-treated trees were much more dispersed in comparison to the control and no injection treatments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). As for the emitted VOCs, it seems from the heatmap that some compounds increased for both oil treatments, such as decanal, caryophyllene and 1-penten-3-ol. Some increases were specific, such as numerous aldehydes for cinnamon oil (2-heptenal, 2-nonenal, 2,4-hexadienal) and terpenes for mint oil (α-terpineol, eucalyptol, β-homocyclocitral). With regard to the EO composition, only α-terpineol was found in trace amounts within the mint EO at 0.25%.
