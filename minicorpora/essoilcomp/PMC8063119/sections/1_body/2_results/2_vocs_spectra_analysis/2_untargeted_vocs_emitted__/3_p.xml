<p>The VOC emission profiles were significantly impacted by the treatment. ANOSIM revealed significant structural differences for VOC profiles between treatments, with some overlapping (
 <italic>R</italic> = 0.281, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.002). On the other hand, PERMANOVA performed on the same data set revealed similar outcomes for comparisons between treatment (
