<p>Multivariate analysis of the emitted VOC profiles performed by PCA captured 83.3% of variance in the first two dimensions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). VOC profiles of EO-injected trees separated well from the control and no injection treatment. On the other hand, as can be observed in the heatmap (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), some compounds are produced for both oils, such as caryophyllene, germacrene D, bergamotene, (E,E)-4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-1,3,7,11-tetraene (TMTT) and linalool, whereas some of them are specific to a particular oil. Indeed, cinnamon-oil-injected trees emitted more terpinen-4-ol, α-farnesene, and trees injected with mint oil emitted more DMNT and β-ocimene. Amongst the compounds previously mentioned, linalool, germacrene D and terpinen-4-ol are found in mint EO, and caryophyllene is found in cinnamon EO, but as minor compounds at concentrations below 1%.
