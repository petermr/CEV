<p>Maximum yields of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) over time are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>. Chlorophyll fluorescence showed that most values were located between 0.80 and 0.85, implying that the trees maintained good ecophysiological performances throughout the experiment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). Two-way repeated measure ANOVA revealed a significant impact of factors (treatment: 
 <italic>F</italic> = 4.759, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.003, ges = 0.082; day: 
 <italic>F</italic> = 4.782, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001, ges = 0.107) without interaction (
 <italic>F</italic> = 1.59, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.099, ges = 0.107). Pairwise comparison demonstrated significant differences only at day 1 between treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>) and only for the control between 24 and 48 h and 24 and 96 h.
