<p>Seeds of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> L. were collected from Johnny’s Selected Seeds, Winslow, ME, United States. The botanical identity of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> was confirmed by comparing them with respect to the reference standards at Johnny’s Selected Seeds. After that, 35-day leaf explants excised from old seedlings were inoculated into Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium (
 <xref rid="B200" ref-type="bibr">Murashige and Skoog, 1962</xref>) supplemented with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4D) and α-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., St. Louis, MO, United States) for callus induction. Callus was initiated by inoculating leaf explants from a 35-day-old plant into MS medium supplemented with various concentrations and combinations of 2,4D (4.5–13 μM) and NAA (5–16 μM), with farnesyl diphosphate (FDP; 1 and 3 μM) (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., St. Louis, MO, United States) as a precursor in the experiment, followed by a previous report by
