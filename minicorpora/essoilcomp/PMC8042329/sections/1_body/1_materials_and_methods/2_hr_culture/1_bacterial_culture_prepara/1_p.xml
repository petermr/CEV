<p>From the overnight glycerol stock, 500 μl was taken and transferred to the Luria–Bertani (LB) medium, and the same was subcultured thrice to obtain active culture. The Gram-negative soil bacteria 
 <italic>Agrobacterium rhizogenes</italic> (A
 <sub>4</sub> and R
 <sub>1000</sub>) transferred to the medium were cultured overnight at 25°C in an orbital shaker at 180 rpm. The bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 15 min at 25°C. The pellet-containing bacterial cells were re-suspended in liquid MS medium, and the final optical density (OD) was adjusted to 0.6.
