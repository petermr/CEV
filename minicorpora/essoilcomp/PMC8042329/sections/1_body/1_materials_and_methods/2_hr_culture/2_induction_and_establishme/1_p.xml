<p>In aseptic condition, leaf explants derived from 45-day-old plants were wounded with a sterile scalpel, transferred into the 
 <italic>A. rhizogenes</italic> infection medium, and incubated for 10 min at 25°C. After infection, the explants were dried on a sterile filter paper and placed on semisolid 1/2 MS medium supplemented with 3% sucrose and supplemented separately with 50, 100, and 150 μM of acetosyringone (AS; Sigma, United States). AS was filter-sterilized by using a 0.2-μm syringe filter 109 (Pall Corp., United States) and added to the cooled autoclaved medium. After cocultivation, explants were washed with liquid 1/2 MS containing 500 mg/L cefotaxime, followed by sterile distilled water. The explants were then inoculated on 1/2 MS medium supplemented with 500 mg/L cefotaxime and kept under dark condition for HR induction. HRs of more than 1–2 cm length were excised from the explants and transferred to 30 ml 1/2 MS, 1/2 MS + B
 <sub>5</sub> vitamins, 1/2 MS + FDP 1 μM, 1/2 MS + FDP 3 μM, 1/2 MS + B
 <sub>5</sub> vitamins + FDP 1 μM, and 1/2 MS + B
 <sub>5</sub> vitamins + FDP 3 μM supplemented with 3% sucrose with 500 mg/L cefotaxime until the residual bacteria are killed completely. The experiment was run thrice with 25 explants for each experiment.
