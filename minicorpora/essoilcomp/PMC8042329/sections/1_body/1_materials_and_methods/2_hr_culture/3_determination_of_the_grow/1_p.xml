<p>Experiments were conducted to evaluate the growth rate of the hair roots grown in 1/2 MS, 1/2 MS + B
 <sub>5</sub> vitamins, 1/2 MS + FDP 1 μM, 1/2 MS + FDP 3 μM, 1/2 MS + B
 <sub>5</sub> vitamins + FDP 1 μM, and 1/2 MS + B
 <sub>5</sub> vitamins + FDP 3 μM. The growth index (GI) of all the four lines was measured initially and inoculated with 20 mg of FW bacteria-free HRs (3 weeks old). It was transferred into a 30 ml liquid medium in a 250 ml conical flask and maintained on a rotary shaker at 120 rpm in a dark room for 12 weeks. The 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> grown HRs were subcultured in a fresh medium for 6 weeks to stimulate further growth of the hairs. Each treatment consisted of three replicates, and each replicate contained 25 explants per treatment. The GI was determined by using the following formula (
