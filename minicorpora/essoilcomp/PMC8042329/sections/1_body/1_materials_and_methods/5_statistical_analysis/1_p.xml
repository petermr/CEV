<p>The evaluation of β-caryophyllene from various callus and HR samples of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> L. leaf explants was performed with three replicates each. The data obtained were analyzed statistically, and observations were recorded on the frequency of both FW and DW (callus and HR cultures, respectively), as well as the number of explants responding for HR initiation growth rate. The statistical analyses were performed by ANOVA using SPSS. The differences between means were tested for significance by Duncan’s multiple range test at 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.05.
