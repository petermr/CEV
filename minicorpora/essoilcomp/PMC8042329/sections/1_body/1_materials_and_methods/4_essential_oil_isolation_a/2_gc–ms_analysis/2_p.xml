<p>The injector port, interface, and ion source temperatures were set at 260, 300, and 230°C, respectively. The programmed oven temperature was as follows: the initial temperature was set at 120°C for 1 min, then raised to 270°C at 6°C/min and finally to 320°C at 7°C/min, and held for 10 min. A solvent delay of 6 min was set to protect the filament from oxidation. The mass spectrometer was operated in electron impact (EI) mode at an ionization potential of 70 eV and at an emission current up to 60 mA. The quantification was performed in selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode by monitoring mass ions for each β-caryophyllene. For quantification, four different calibrators (0.125, 0.250, 0.500, and 1.00 mg/ml) were used for linearity check. It showed good correlation coefficient (
