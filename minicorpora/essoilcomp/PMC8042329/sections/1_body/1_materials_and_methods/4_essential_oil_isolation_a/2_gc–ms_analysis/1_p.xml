<p>The extracted sample was cleaned by passing it through a silica gel column (glass column) containing glass wool, silica gel 60 (230–400 mesh; Merck, United States), and anhydrous Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>, which helps to remove high-molecular-weight polar substances and impurities that interfere with GC–MS analysis. For quantitative analysis, β-caryophyllene standard and essential oil were dissolved with ethyl acetate and analyzed using a GC-MS-QP2010 (Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with an AOC-20i autosampler. One microliter of the essential oil was injected, and the chromatographic separation of β-caryophyllene was achieved with HP5-MS column (60 m × 0.25 mm I.D. × 0.25 mm thickness; Restek, United States). Helium with a purity of 99.999% was utilized as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 10 ml/min.
