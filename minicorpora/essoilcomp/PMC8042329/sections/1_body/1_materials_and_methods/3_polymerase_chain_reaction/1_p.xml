<p>Integration of the T-DNA, which is responsible for HR formation, was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis using 
 <italic>rolB</italic> gene and 
 <italic>rolC</italic> gene-specific primers (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Cho et al., 1998</xref>). Genomic DNA was isolated from both the control non-transformed roots and the transformed HR cultures by using the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Khanuja et al., 1999</xref>). The following primers were used for PCR analysis: for 
 <italic>rolB</italic> gene, forward primers—5-ATG GAT CCC AAA TTG CTA TTC CCC CAC GA-3 and reverse primers—5-TTA GGC TTC TTT CAT TCG GTT TAC TGC AGC-3 and for 
 <italic>rolC</italic> gene, forward primers—5-ATG GCT GAA GAC GAC CTG TGT T-3 and reverse primers—5-TTA GCC GAT TGC AAA CTT GCA C-3. The PCR was carried out by amplifying with an initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at 55°C for 1 min 
 <italic>rolB</italic> and 
 <italic>rolC</italic>, and extension at 72°C for 1 min with a final extension of 72°C for 10 min using an Applied Biosystems Veriti Thermal Cycler (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States). The amplified products were analyzed by electrophoresing 1.4% (
 <italic>w/v</italic>) of agarose gel along with 100 bp DNA marker (New England Biolabs, United Kingdom) staining with ethidium bromide.
