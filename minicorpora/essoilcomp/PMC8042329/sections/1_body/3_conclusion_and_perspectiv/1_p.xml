<p>This study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first attempt in reporting 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> precursor treatment for enhancement of β-caryophyllene content by using callus and HR culture of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> L. Although the biosynthesis pathway of secondary metabolites has not been well explored, the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway is well known for the production of β-caryophyllene 
 <italic>via</italic> FDP. In this study, we aimed to enhance the output by using FDP as a precursor, and our findings proved that by using precursor-treated cultures, we can improve β-caryophyllene production. In conclusion, β-caryophyllene enhancement was successfully done with precursor-treated HR culture of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> L. after 12 weeks in combined treatment culture of 1/2 MS + FDP 3 μM (2.92 mg/ml, respectively). These findings could encourage and provide support to synthesize new active natural bioactive compounds as an alternative to synthetic repellent and insecticides.
