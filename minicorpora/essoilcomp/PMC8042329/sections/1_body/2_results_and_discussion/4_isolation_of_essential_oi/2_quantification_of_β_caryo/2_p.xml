<p>Similarly, a farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (VoFPS) gene co-transformation system was developed in 
 <italic>Valeriana officinalis</italic> HRs for the enhancement of β-caryophyllene compound by recombinant and elicited methods (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Ricigliano et al., 2016</xref>). The attained values, similar to those reported from different 
 <italic>A. rhizogenes</italic> mediated transformations of several medicinal plant species, have been studied for the production of essential oil by both transformed and non-transformed root cultures (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Santos et al., 2002</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">Szoke et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Sujatha et al., 2013</xref>). The results from the present study agreed with the previous reports on various precursor and elicitor treatments for root induction. Some plants of vincamine biosynthesis were established through 
 <italic>Vinca minor</italic> HR clone that was determined with various elicitor (acetyltransferase) and precursor treatments (cyclooxygenase inhibitor); the highest vincamine compound was observed at 17% (
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">Verma et al., 2014</xref>). Enhanced tanshinones production in 
 <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic> HR culture was used with different elicitors combined with yeast extract

 </bold> MeJA, and elicitation metabolite profiling was analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 2013</xref>). The use of MeJA and other signaling compounds for elicitation of transforming root cultures is opening a new way for a possibly profitable 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> secondary metabolite production (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Ahlawat et al., 2014</xref>). A soluble recombinant enzyme can catalyze the covalently bonded metal ion-dependent conversion of FDP to β-caryophyllene, sesquiterpene olefin contained in 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> essential oil, was given by heterologous gene expression in 
 <italic>Escherichia coli.</italic> Moreover, all through the initial stages, the β-caryophyllene synthase overexpressed in certain plant tissues and triggered in old ones in response to fungal elicitor suggests a role besides β-caryophyllene in host defense (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al., 2002</xref>). Recently, 
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">Souret et al. (2002)</xref> have cloned three genes from 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> that affect terpenes’ biosynthesis: 1-deoxy-
 <sc>D</sc>-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS), 1-deoxy-
 <sc>D</sc>-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR), and synthase from squalene (SQS) to use a library of cDNA made from hairy 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> roots. Previously, overexpression of farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase in 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> leads to high artemisinin aggregation levels by converting IPP and DMADP into diphenylphosphinic acid pentafluorophenyl ester (FDPP) (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Banyai et al., 2010</xref>). Cloning and characterization of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate reductase (AaHDR) involved in enhanced artemisinin production 
 <italic>via</italic> improved artemisinin biosynthetic pathway precursor development through the MEP pathway were being reported in 
 <italic>A. annua</italic>. Tryptophan alkaloid compound enhanced through precursor feeding in HR culture has been identified (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Hughes et al., 2004</xref>). The effect of precursor-treated HR suspension culture has produced a high level of glucosinolate compound of 
 <italic>Nasturtium montanum</italic> and 
 <italic>Cleome chelidonii</italic> (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">Songsak and Lockwood, 2004</xref>). 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Robins et al. (1990</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">1991)</xref> also reported hyoscyamine compound biosynthesis during metabolic pathways as amino acid precursors. 
 <italic>A. rhizogenes</italic> enables the high production of these secondary metabolites for extensive industrial applications (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">Srivastava and Srivastava, 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">Suza et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">Swarna and Ravindhran, 2012</xref>) that are useful as pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and food additives (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Signs and Flores, 1990</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Guillon et al., 2006</xref>). In this study, HR culture has been compared with some previous reports that were treated with different precursors/elicitors (
