<p>The essential oil isolated from the HR was quantified with various concentrations of the β-caryophyllene standard compound by the SIM method. The retention time of β-caryophyllene compound was observed at 7.34 s. Among various treatments of the A
 <sub>4</sub> induced HR, the highest β-caryophyllene compound in HR cultures without precursor treatment was 2.44 mg/ml, whereas precursor-treated HR showed 2.92 mg/ml (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The highest β-caryophyllene compound in R
 <sub>1000</sub> induced HR cultures without precursor treatment was 1/2 MS (2.16 mg/ml) and precursor treatment with 1/2 MS + FDP 3 μM (2.80 mg/ml) (
