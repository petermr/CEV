<p>The essential oil isolated from 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> L. callus was quantified with various concentrations of the β-caryophyllene standard compound. The calibration curve (SIM method) was determined to be utilized. GC–MS of β-caryophyllene compound retention time peak was observed at 7.34 s. In the present study, extracts of callus samples were analyzed through GC–MS by the scan mode method, and the highest β-caryophyllene compound was observed in without precursor-treated callus 2,4D 13.5 μM (1.61 mg/ml) and precursor-treated callus 2,4D 13.5 μM + FDP 3 μM (2.38 mg/ml), followed by NAA 16.1 μM (2.28 mg/ml) (

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Arya and Patni, 2013</xref>), where enhanced quercetin compound (0.23 mg/ml) in precursor-treated callus was noticed. Treatment of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> callus with benzyl adenine (BAP) and NAA (2 mg/L), along with amino acids, such as valine and cysteine (12.5 mg/L), resulted in higher content of artemisinin compound (
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">Zia et al., 2007</xref>). Enhanced trigonelline content was noticed through thin-layer chromatography, gas–liquid chromatography, and GC–MS analysis in nicotinic acid used as precursor in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> callus culture (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Mathur and Kamal, 2012</xref>). Similarly, casein hydrolysate precursor feeding in cell suspension culture at 50, 75, and 100 mg/L concentrations resulted in the highest scopoletin compound, as revealed by high-performance thin-layer chromatography analysis (

 <italic>Simmondsia chinensis</italic> (leaves, nodes, internodes, shoot apices, and cotyledons) were used for callus induction from MS media along with various growth regulators [NAA, BAP, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and isopentenyl adenine (2ip)], and the final quantitative estimation of essential oils was observed at the highest amount of oil content at a 9-week-old callus culture (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Aftab et al., 2008</xref>). A similar phenomenon has been observed in several studies (
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2001</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Ouyang et al., 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Sivanandhan et al., 2012</xref>). In this study, calli are compared with previous reports that were treated with different precursors/elicitors as shown in
