<p>The transformation efficiency of 
 <italic>A. rhizogenes</italic> required a different time and duration for the root induction from leaf explants of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> L. (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The highest transformation frequency with a direct root induction from the wounding site was observed in leaf explants infected with AS 150 μM (A
 <sub>4</sub> and R
 <sub>1000</sub>) strains after 10–15 days of culture (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The results of the present study were similar to 
 <italic>Persicaria minor</italic> HR induction treatments with AS at 100 and 200 μM, which suggested that phenolic compounds play a vital role in the induction medium, particularly at wounded sites (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Danphitsanuparn et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Ashraf et al., 2015</xref>). It was reported that AS stimulated 
 <italic>A. rhizogenes</italic> T-DNA to bring out HR from the wounded cell tissue (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Farshad Ashraf et al., 2013</xref>). HR induction by different bacterial strains has been documented earlier in different plant species (
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">Zehra et al., 1999</xref>). In 
 <italic>C. roseus</italic>, six different 
 <italic>A. rhizogenes</italic> strains were used for HR induction (
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">Toivonen et al., 1989</xref>). Strain induced HR with the help of 
 <italic>Rauwolfia serpentina</italic> leaf explants with a transformation frequency of 70% for strain when compared with strain LBA 9402, with a frequency of 45% (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Goel et al., 2010</xref>). 
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">Tao and Li (2006)</xref> reported HR induction in 
 <italic>Torenia fournieri</italic> leaf explant with higher transformation efficiency at 65% than that in A
 <sub>4</sub> strain. 
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al. (2003)</xref> earlier reported that 100 μM of AS is the best concentration for enhancing the genetic transformation in 
 <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic> var. Previous studies indicated that the 
 <italic>A. rhizogenes</italic> strain, which influenced HR induction in various explant parts, was showing HR induction (
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2003</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Pietrosiuk et al., 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">Thimmaraju et al., 2008</xref>). In the present study, exogenous application of AS along with naturally produced phenolics from wounded leaf explants increased the transformation frequency by vir-genes induction.
