<p>There are various compositions and types of culture medium known to influence the growth and production of HRs (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Giri and Narasu, 2000</xref>). Among all the treatments tested (1/2 MS, 1/2 MS + B
 <sub>5</sub> vitamins, 1/2 MS + FDP 1 μM, 1/2 MS +FDP 3 μM, 1/2 MS + B
 <sub>5</sub> vitamins + FDP 1 μM, and 1/2 MS + B
 <sub>5</sub> vitamins + FDP 3 μM), the HR culture attained a maximum and minimum of a 30-fold and a 65-fold increase of the initial weight of 200 mg (strain), and the HR culture attained a maximum and minimum of a 25-fold and a 55-fold increase in the initial weight of 163 mg (R
 <sub>1000</sub>) within 12 weeks on 1/2 MS + FDP 1 μM and 1/2 MS + FDP 3 μM, respectively. After 6 weeks, there was no significant difference in the GI% in another precursor-treated HRs. However, after 12 weeks of culture, GI% was greater in the GI of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> L. HRs with a strain at 6 and 12 weeks in the rotary shaking system. At 6 weeks GI of A
 <sub>4</sub> HR culture, GI% was found without precursor treatment in 1/2 MS (42.10%) and 1/2 MS + B
 <sub>5</sub> vitamins (32.55%) and with precursor treatment in 1/2 MS + FDP 3 μM (70.85%) and 1/2 MS + B
 <sub>5</sub> vitamins + FDP 3 μM (60.23%). After 12 weeks, the GI of A
 <sub>4</sub> HR culture without precursor treatment was observed as 1/2 MS (27.33%) and 1/2 MS + B
 <sub>5</sub> vitamins (30.33%), and with precursor treatment, it was observed with the highest response in 1/2 MS + FDP 3 μM (55.00%) and 1/2 MS + B
 <sub>5</sub> vitamins + FDP 3 μM (77.33%), respectively (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> shows the GI of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> L. by HRs at 6 and 12 weeks cultivation in the rotary shaking system. At 6 weeks, the GI of R1000 HR culture without precursor treatment was observed in 1/2 MS (22.11%) and 1/2 MS + B5 vitamins (27.44%), and with precursor treatment, it was observed in 1/2 MS + FDP 3 μM (45.11%) and 1/2 MS + B5 vitamins + FDP 3 μM (61.00%). After 12 weeks, the GI of R1000 HR culture without precursor treatment was observed in 1/2 MS (27.33%) and 1/2 MS + B5 vitamins (30.31%), and with precursor treatment, it was observed in 1/2 MS + FDP 3 μM (55.00%) and 1/2 MS + B5 vitamins + FDP 3 μM (77.33%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5B</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C,D</xref>). In an earlier report, 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> L. HR culture grown in different liquid culture media, such as B5, SH (Schenk and Hilderbrandt), MS, and 1/2 MS, after 30 days showed 3-fold increases in growth rate (
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Sujatha et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, HRs grown in full-strength and half-strength MS media, respectively, showed 46- and 34-fold increased growth rates in 
 <italic>C. roseus</italic> L. plant (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Hanafy et al., 2016</xref>). In another study, 
 <italic>A. rhizogenes</italic> MTCC 532 used in HR induction with the combination of 1/2 MS liquid medium without hormones showed GI with a 45-fold increase within 57 days of culture (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Khatodia et al., 2013</xref>). In 
 <italic>Gentiana scabra</italic> HR culture, a maximum 42-fold increase was achieved through B5 liquid media composition after 8 weeks of cultivation (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2014</xref>). The establishment of HR liquid cultures was observed in 
 <italic>Rauvolfia micrantha</italic> (
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">Sudha et al., 2003</xref>) and 
 <italic>Gentiana macrophylla</italic> (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">Tiwari et al., 2007</xref>). Inconsistent with the above work, the present study noticed a higher growth rate index of HRs in 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> L. on the same B5 and 1/2 MS liquid medium compositions. The HRs grown in 1/2 MS + B5 vitamins + FDP 3 μM medium showed a higher biomass increase and were expressed in either FW or DW when compared with those grown in 1/2 MS, 1/2 MS + B5 vitamins, 1/2 MS +FDP 1 μM, 1/2 MS + B5 vitamins + FDP 1 μM, and 1/2 MS + FDP 3 μM. A4 strain HR production increased with FW and DW on different media, such as FW 1/2 MS (23 g), 1/2 MS + B5 vitamins (26 g), 1/2 MS + FDP 3 μM (39 g), and 1/2 MS + B5 vitamins + FDP 3 μM (40 g) and DW 1/2 MS (12 g), 1/2 MS + B5 vitamins (14 g), 1/2 MS + FDP 3 μM (17 g), and 1/2 MS + B5 vitamins + FDP 3 μM (20 g). The R1000 HRs showed high production with increased FW and DW on different media: FW 1/2 MS (21 g), 1/2 MS + B5 vitamins (22 g), 1/2 MS + FDP 3 μM (39 g), and 1/2 MS + B5 vitamins + FDP 3 μM (41 g) and DW 1/2 MS (10 g), 1/2 MS + B5 vitamins (11 g), 1/2 MS + FDP 3 μM (19 g), and 1/2 MS + B5 vitamins + FDP 3 μM (19 g) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). The present findings are in agreement with the report of 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al. (2014)</xref> who stated that the use of HR cultures is an excellent alternative to harvesting natural 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> grown plants to produce pharmaceuticals and important metabolites in less time with the highest quality. In 
 <italic>Salvia officinalis</italic> L. HR culture with strain, the maximum accumulated DW was achieved with 45 mg for 50 days (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Grzegorczyk et al., 2006</xref>). The largest biomass was enhanced with 1/2 MS medium of low sucrose concentration to increase the lateral branches. In agreement with the findings, sucrose has been reported to increase HR biomass in 
 <italic>Artemisia absinthium</italic> (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Nin et al., 1997</xref>) and 
 <italic>Swertia chirata</italic> (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Keil et al., 2000</xref>). 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Inoguchi et al. (2003)</xref> also reported that high-level growth rates of root were induced by using 1/2 MS salt liquid medium in 
 <italic>Solidago altissima</italic>. In 
 <italic>Callerya speciosa</italic>, the highest growth of HRs was in 1/2 MS medium 10.85 g of FW and 1.13 g of DW and B5 medium, followed by 7.50 g of FW and 0.63 g of DW (
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">Yao et al., 2016</xref>). 
 <italic>Perilla frutescens</italic> cells of 7-day-old cultures were exposed to a yeast elicitor at 0.5–5% 
 <italic>(v/v)</italic> in 7 days. Anthocyanin content peaked around 10.2% DW with yeast elicitor at 1% 
 <italic>(v/v)</italic>. Simultaneously, the maximum production of OA and ursolic acid was 19 and 27 mg/L, respectively, and a 46 and 24% increase in cultures administered with a 2% 
 <italic>(v/v)</italic> yeast elicitor (
