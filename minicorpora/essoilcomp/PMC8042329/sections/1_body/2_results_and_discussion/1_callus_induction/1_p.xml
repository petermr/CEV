<p>Leaf explants were inoculated into MS medium containing 2,4D (4–13 μM) and NAA (5–16 μM) with FDP as a precursor (1 and 3 μM) individually, as per a previous study by 
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Sundararajan and Kumari (2015)</xref>. Among various concentrations tested, the highest response of callus (99 and 95.2%) was achieved in MS medium supplemented with a combination of 2,4D (9.0 μM) + FDP (3 μm), followed by MS medium supplemented with NAA (16.1 μM) + FDP (3 μM). There are various similar studies on callus induction from leaf and stem explants of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> L. (

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Borzabad et al., 2010a</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). The precursor- and elicitor-treated calli vary from species to species and often differ even within the same species, for example, 
 <italic>Jatropha integerrima</italic> (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Schmitt and Petersen, 2002</xref>). MS medium supplemented with 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) as a precursor 2, 5, and 10 mg/L concentration has shown an enhancement in the callus biomass and induction of rooting and shooting with a profound effect (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Boitel-Conti et al., 2000</xref>). 
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">Sujatha and Dhingra (1993)</xref> reported that feeding the yeast extract elicitor in the suspension culture of 
 <italic>J. integerrima</italic> promoted the metabolic enzyme activity and alkaloid production several folds. Other studies also reported enhanced biosynthesis of the flavonolignan silymarin compound through jasmonic acid (JA) elicitor treatment of 
 <italic>Silybum marianum</italic> callus cell culture medium (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Sanchez-Sampedro et al., 2005</xref>). In recent reports, three key genes, such as phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, chalcone synthase, and dihydroflavonol-4-reductase, were reported to be involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway. A polyphenolic compound has been used in 
 <italic>Plantago ovata</italic> callus culture media with different growth regulators (
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">Talukder et al., 2016</xref>). 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Arya and Patni (2013)</xref> reported significant enhancement of quercetin in callus culture of 
 <italic>Pluchea lanceolata</italic> by incorporation of cinnamic acid and precursor feeding with 
 <sc>L</sc>-phenylalanine. In the present study, FW/DW of callus 2,4D treated without precursor was observed at FW/DW: 36/22 g, whereas in precursor-treated callus the highest FW/DW: 48/28 g were noticed at the concentrations (2,4D 13.5 μM + FDP 3 μM) followed by (2,4D 9 μM + FDP μM) fresh and dry weight was exhibited (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Then fresh and dry weight of NAA treated callus without precursor was found to be 36/20 g, respectively, whereas in precursor-treated callus the highest FW/DW: 48/26 g was noticed at the concentrations (NAA 16.1 μM + FDP 3 μM) followed by (NAA 10.7 μM + FDP 3 μM) fresh and dry weight was exhibited (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Similar reports were observed in connection with FW 500 mg withanolides production in callus culture of 
 <italic>Withania somnifera</italic> after 4 weeks of culture (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Doma et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Sivanandhan et al., 2012</xref>). This study is in agreement with the result of a previous report on the large-scale production of artemisinin with different elicitors and precursors, such as sodium acetate, mevalonic acid, lactone, and casein acid hydrolysate, to increase artemisinin content in cell suspension culture of 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Baldi and Dixit, 2008</xref>). Quercetin compound was enhanced by using various precursors, such as phenylalanine and cinnamic acid, in 
 <italic>P. lanceolata in vitro</italic> callus culture (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Arya and Patni, 2013</xref>). Similar results were also observed in 
 <italic>Psoralea corylifolia</italic> with precursor treatment in cotyledonary callus, which was obtained from FW 2,601.8 mg/g (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Mohammadparast et al., 2015</xref>). A similar phenomenon was also observed with different synthetic precursors, such as phenobarbital, geraniol, 
 <italic>trans</italic>-cinnamic acid, succinic acid, and tryptamine, in compact callus cluster (CCC) cultures of 
 <italic>Catharanthus roseus</italic> with the highest biomass production of FW 10 g and DW 6 g (
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2001</xref>). Phenylethanoid glycosides were enhanced by feeding precursor into the 
 <italic>Cistanche deserticola</italic> cell culture medium, with FW 0.6 g and DW 0.4 g (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Ouyang et al., 2005</xref>). In earlier studies, the intracellular amount of oleanolic acid (OA) reached its final value (DW 0.84 mg/g) after 72 h of treatment with 100 M JA, which was 9.4-fold greater than that observed in untreated control cultures. After 48 h of therapy, the inclusion of chitosan at 50 mg/L induced a 5-fold increase in OA accumulation (DW 0.37 mg/g) (
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">Wiktorowska et al., 2010</xref>). The precursor feeding or elicitor treatment is an effective technique to improve the growth of secondary metabolites through plant cell culture (
