<p>Molecular confirmation of the transformed HRs was achieved by PCR analysis. The presence of 
 <italic>rolB</italic> gene fragment (780 bp) and 
 <italic>rolC</italic> gene fragment (540 bp) was confirmed by using gene-specific primers, and successful transformation was confirmed by the presence of 
 <italic>rolB</italic> and 
 <italic>rolC</italic> gene fragments. The results of PCR study indicated that the 
 <italic>rolB</italic> and 
 <italic>rolC</italic> gene fragments were incorporated into the 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> L. HR cultures. It indicates that the presence of the incorporation of the T-DNA into the genome of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> L. HRs has been successful (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). Many studies concluded that the HR culture metabolite production depends on 
 <italic>rol</italic> gene expression (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">Tiwari et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Bulgakov, 2008</xref>). The 
 <italic>rol</italic> genes play a major role in the pathway that leads to the increased production of secondary metabolites. In many cases, the 
 <italic>rol</italic> gene of strain is involved in the parthenogenesis of the HR disease and establishment of transgenic plants with simple developmental and morphological alteration (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Jouanin et al., 1987</xref>). The establishment of the root inducing (Ri) disease in HRs is interrelated with the expression of the 
 <italic>rolA</italic>, 
 <italic>B</italic>, 
 <italic>C</italic>, and 
 <italic>D</italic> loci in the majority assay of plant species (
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al., 1985</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Cardarelli et al., 1987</xref>). Along with them, 
 <italic>rolB</italic> plays the most important role, whereas 
 <italic>rolA</italic>, 
 <italic>rolC</italic>, and 
 <italic>rolD</italic> encourage the root development synergistically (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Aoki and Sy√¥no, 1999</xref>). The growth model of 
 <italic>rolB</italic>-induced HR is characterized by high-level growth, branching, and plagiotropism (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Capone et al., 1989</xref>). Genetically mediated transformation by Ri T-DNA of 
 <italic>A. rhizogenes</italic> has been established to be an effective indirect way of accumulating and producing high levels of secondary metabolites in plant cells (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Guillon et al., 2006</xref>). In a confirmation study in agreement with 
 <italic>A. rhizogenes</italic>, there is a type of Gram-negative well-known soil-borne bacterium that causes HRs in many plants. Root loci (
 <italic>rol</italic>) genes harbored by the Ri plasmid of this bacterium are integrated into the host plant genome, causing HRs. 
 <italic>rol</italic> genes are a reflection to affect the growth and development of transformed roots and induce secondary metabolite synthesis by turning on the mediated transcription defense genes (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Ono and Tian, 2011</xref>).
