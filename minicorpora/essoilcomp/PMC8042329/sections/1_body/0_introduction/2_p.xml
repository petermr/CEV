<p>Caryophyllene is present in 
 <italic>Zingiber nimmonii</italic> rhizome essential oil that helps curing fungal and bacterial infection (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Sabulal et al., 2006</xref>). 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Gertsch et al. (2008)</xref> have reported about β-caryophyllene compound that was shown to interact with the binding site cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2), but not to type 1 (CB1). This chemical compound is energetically anti-inflammatory and has anesthetic properties. 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Amiel et al. (2012)</xref> reported that the essential oil (β-caryophyllene) of 
 <italic>Commiphora gileadensis</italic> (Balm of Gilead, mentioned in the Bible) has an anti-proliferative property against tumor cell lines. They also found that β-caryophyllene caused a strong induction of apoptosis accompanied by DNA ladder formation and caspase-3 catalytic activity in tumor cell lines. However, the plant sesquiterpenes biosynthesis pathway is considered as an isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), which is the universal biological precursor of all isoprenoids (basic C
 <sub>5</sub> isoprene unit). It can be obtained through either mevalonate (MVA) or 2-methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathways (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Moreover, it has been well established that the acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) pathway in plants is located in the cytosol, whereas the MEP pathway is targeted to plastids inside (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Croteau et al., 2000</xref>). There are studies that indicate cross-talk and possible IPP exchange between the other two paths through the cytosol and plastids (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Adam and Zapp, 1998</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Laule et al., 2003</xref>). There were also two independent pathways leading to IPP: the mevalonate pathway (MVA) originating from acetyl-CoA and the pyruvate-derived mevalonate-independent pathway (MEP) (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Croteau et al., 2000</xref>). IPP instead contributes to the other terpenoids with its isomer dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP). The MVA isoprenoid pathway is used by eukaryotes apart from plants, although prokaryotes with many exemptions use the MEP pathway to create IPP and DMAPP separately (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Lichtenthaler, 1999</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Boucher and Doolittle, 2000</xref>). Isopentenyl phosphate kinases (IPKs) generated by plant genomes are derived isopentenyl phosphate (IP) 
 <italic>via</italic> ATP-dependent phosphorylation, forming the primary metabolite IPP commonly used for isoprenoid/terpenoid biosynthesis (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Henry et al., 2018</xref>). The objective of the present study is to enhance β-caryophyllene content in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> callus and hairy root (HR) cultures and to isolate the essential oil from both calli and HRs in order to understand the metabolic profile of β-caryophyllene using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS).
