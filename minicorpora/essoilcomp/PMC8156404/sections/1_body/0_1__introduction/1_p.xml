<p>The word 
 <italic>Origanum</italic> means “ornament of the mountains”, which comes from the Greek words oros that means mountain or hill, and ganos that means ornament. Since ancient times, 
 <italic>Origanum</italic> species have been used as medicinal herbs. However, nowadays the importance of 
 <italic>Origanum</italic> species in culinary practices has outgrown their therapeutic importance. Recently, several species have been used as ornamentals. The genus 
 <italic>Origanum</italic> was first described by Linnaeus in 1754 [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and it belongs to the Mentheae tribe Labiatae family [
 <xref rid="B2-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. More than 300 scientific names were given to less than 70 
 <italic>Origanum</italic> hybrids, varieties, species, and sub-species in the past 150 years. Seventeen hybrids, 6 sub-species, 38 species, 10 sections, and 3 groups were identified in 1980 by Ietswaart [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] based on the diverse morphological characteristics such as: stems length, stems and leaves indumentum, sessile glands number, verticillasters arrangement, and branches number, arrangement, and length. After that, one more hybrid and five more species were recognized [
 <xref rid="B3-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Mainly, 
 <italic>Origanum</italic> species are distributed in the Mediterranean region. Out of the 43 species, 35 species occur solely in the East Mediterranean [
 <xref rid="B3-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. 
 <italic>Origanum</italic> species grow spontaneously in the Mediterranean region and get harvested once or twice per year during the flowering stage from wild population plants [
 <xref rid="B3-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. 
 <italic>Origanum</italic> species can be propagated using seeds, cuttings, layering, or division. The species’ growing habit and variability will determine the best method for its propagation. The species 
 <italic>Origanum syriacum</italic> is known by different names, such as “za’atar”, Lebanese oregano, Syrian oregano, and Bible hyssop [
 <xref rid="B4-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It is a native crop in the eastern Mediterranean, western Asia, and southern Europe even though it has been cultivated in many parts of the world [
 <xref rid="B5-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> is a perennial herb with height ranging from 60 to 90 cm, woody creeping roots, and branched woody hairy stems [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Locally, the term za’atar (more correctly “za’atar mix”) is used to refer to designated herb mixes, in which traditional ingredients are added to the za’atar herb [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Za’atar flowers and leaves are commonly consumed after drying, grinding, and mixing with other ingredients. The strong and pleasant aroma of za’atar is related to its rich essential oil content [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The low cost, pleasant flavor, and diversity of 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> culinary applications make it one of the most important stable herbs in the Arab region [
 <xref rid="B9-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Za’atar products can be classified into three categories: fresh za’atar, dried za’atar, and essential oil herb [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Codex Alimentarius and ISO have established the standards for these products [
 <xref rid="B10-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Za’atar production practices include seedling propagation, cultivation in the field, weed and pest control, irrigation and fertigation, and finally, harvesting and processing herb [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Limited data about processing effects on za’atar quality attributes are available. Hence, more studies are required to fully understand how za’atar is affected by processing and which processing condition can produce za’atar with optimum quality. Palestinian za’atar has a great economic value but many challenges are facing the Palestinian za’atar market growth [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Za’atar is also a powerful symbol of the Palestinian culture and it is strongly connected to the Palestinian identity [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. 
 <italic>Origanum</italic> secondary metabolites are well studied in both essential oils and polyphenolic compounds terms [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The major components of 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> essential oil are thymol, carvacrol, sabinene hydrate, γ-terpinene, and p-cymene. Many factors can affect plants’ essential oil, including genotype, geographical location, altitude, harvesting time, vegetative stage, plant part, soil, drying and storage conditions, extraction method, and others [
 <xref rid="B15-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> has been used in folk medicine, especially in Arab countries [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Za’atar plants were found to have valuable functionality including antimicrobial, antioxidant, and other interesting activities. Several studies have been conducted to determine the composition of za’atar essential oil. Understanding all the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence the essential oil composition is necessary to determine the required conditions for producing za’atar and za’atar essential oil with optimum characteristics.
