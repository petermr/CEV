<p>The harvesting location and cultivation method have interesting effects on the yield and composition of 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> essential oil. These effects were noticed in six studies conducted in different countries [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], while only one study did not report an effect of the harvesting location on za’atar essential oil composition [
 <xref rid="B38-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. A difference between the levels of geraniol and geranyl esters in za’atar essential oil from Egypt and Israel was observed in one study [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], while five studies reported differences in 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> essential oil yield and its main components thymol and carvacrol levels in different geographical locations and cultivation methods [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, the observations of these studies are contrary. In two studies it was reported that the higher altitude produced 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> with the higher essential oil yield [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], while the opposite was reported in the other two studies [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. For the essential oil composition, carvacrol was the main compound in essential oils obtained from 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> harvested from the higher altitude locations, and thymol was the main compound in essential oils obtained from za’atar harvested from the lower altitude locations in three studies [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In one study, carvacrol and thymol were the main compounds in essential oils obtained from 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> harvested from the lower altitude locations, and γ-terpinene and α-terpinene were the main compounds in essential oils obtained from 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> harvested from the higher altitude locations [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It is important to note that thymol was the main compound in wild 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> essential oil, and carvacrol was the main compound in cultivated 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> essential oil in one study [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], but in another study, when wild 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> was harvested from a high-altitude location it had carvacrol as the main component, and cultivated 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> harvested from a low-altitude location had thymol as the main component [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We suggest that although all environmental factors can affect za’atar essential oil, some factors such as altitude have a stronger effect than other factors, such as cultivation.
