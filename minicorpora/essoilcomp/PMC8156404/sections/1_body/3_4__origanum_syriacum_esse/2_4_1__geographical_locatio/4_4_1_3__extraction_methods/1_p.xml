<p>Besides the effect of the environmental factors on za’atar essential oil, extracting and identification methods can also have an impact on za’atar essential oil yield and composition. Hydro-distillation produced higher essential oil yield compared to supercritical-fluid-extraction (SFE) in a study [

However, the levels of each identified component were enhanced in solvent extraction depending on their solubility in the different solvents [
