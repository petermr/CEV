<p>Antioxidant dietary supplies from 
 <italic>Origanum</italic> plants have been considered effective scavengers of the human body’s metabolic pathway free radicals [
 <xref rid="B3-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A large number of studies found an antioxidant activity in 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic>. Antioxidant activity protects cells from harmful free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The antioxidant activity also improves endothelial function, stimulates DNA repair, and has anti-inflammatory action. Many studies indicated that phenolic compounds and flavonoids in essential oils are responsible for the antioxidant activity. It was also found that 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> essential oil exhibits an antiparasitic activity that might be due to its phenolic compounds, such as thymol and carvacrol, flavonoids, and terpenoids [
 <xref rid="B40-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Assessing the antioxidant activity of a product should be carried out using more than one technique. Using one technique can give information about the antioxidant activity of the sample, but combining different techniques will give more detailed information on the antioxidant activity. Comparing the values of antioxidant activity obtained in different laboratories is difficult, even if the same technique was used, due to the differences in sample preparation, antioxidants extraction, end-points selection, and results expression. Therefore, combining different techniques is necessary [

 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> essential oil showed antioxidant activity in a wide range of assays. Similar to the antimicrobial activity, variable concentrations and concentration units were used by the studies. One study tested the antioxidant capacity of 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> essential oil compounds as well [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Three studies reported that the antioxidant capacity of 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> essential oil was concentration-dependent [

 <xref rid="B45-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Another study found that dried 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> essential oil exhibited higher antioxidant activity than fresh 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> essential oil [
 <xref rid="B36-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. It was reported in a study that the essential oil with the richest γ-terpinene and α-terpinene contents had the highest antioxidant capacity [
