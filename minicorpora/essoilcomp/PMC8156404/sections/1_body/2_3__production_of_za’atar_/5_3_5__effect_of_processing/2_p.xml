 <xref rid="B17-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] investigated the effect of air-, freeze-, and vacuum oven-drying on TP, rosmarinic acid, and antioxidant capacity in six Lamiaceae herbs: oregano, rosemary, marjoram, thyme, sage, and basil. All were harvested from the northern Negev Desert in Israel. Antioxidant capacity was measured by ferric-reducing antioxidant property (FRAP) and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC). Air-drying was carried out in a dark and well-ventilated area for 3 weeks at room temperature with a mean of 14 °C and 10% relative humidity. On the other side, vacuum oven-drying was carried out at 70 °C for 16 h, while freeze-drying was carried out at −54 °C for 72 h and further water sublimation under vacuum. A wide variation was observed among the content of TP, FRAP, and ORAC values. The lowest TP content range was found in a fresh sample of sage on day 0, while the highest TP content was found in the air-dried sample of thyme at day 0. Similarly, the fresh sage sample at day 0 had the lowest FRAP value, and air-dried thyme at day 0 had the highest FRAP value. Air-dried thyme also had the highest ORAC; however, the lowest ORAC was found in fresh rosemary on day 0. No significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) effect of storage on the assays was observed, except in the fresh samples. This could have resulted from the immediate vacuum-packed at −20 °C storage after the treatments. The absence of oxygen together with the low temperature in the storage environment inhibited the enzymatic oxidation of antioxidants in dried herbs. On the other hand, storing fresh samples at −20 °C caused severe chilling injury due to the presence of a high level of moisture and the loss of plants’ integrity. The highest release of antioxidants in fresh samples was observed on day 15 with no further loss observed after that. However, the woody herb thyme was not affected by the chilling injury and no increase in its TP and antioxidants capacity occurred in the fresh thyme sample when stored at −20 °C. All three drying methods were similar in their efficiency and produced typical amounts of dry weight. The higher contents of TP in the dried samples compared to the fresh ones were suggested to be caused by the breaking of cell walls when the brittle dry herbs were milled and homogenized, which increased the release of phenolic compounds. Another suggested reason was the enzymatic degradation of antioxidants in the fresh sample, where the enzymes were active due to the presence of moisture. Air-dried samples had the highest levels of both TP content and antioxidant capacity. In air-drying, herbs lose moisture gradually, which might allow the metabolically active plants to sense this stress and produce phenolic compounds as a defense mechanism. This was proved by the significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher content of rosmarinic acid in air-dried samples compared to both fresh and other dried samples. Rosemary and thyme were the only herbs that showed significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) differences in TP content and antioxidant capacity among vacuum oven-dried and freeze-dried samples. The vacuum oven-dried rosemary sample showed significantly higher TP content and FRAP level than freeze-dried rosemary, but no significant ORAC difference was found between them. Thyme showed the highest difference between TP content and antioxidant capacity in the vacuum oven- and freeze-dried samples among all herbs. Intact tissues in woody herbs such as thyme and rosemary act as barriers against phenolic compound release, which reduces their antioxidant capacity. The higher levels of TP content and antioxidant capacity in vacuum oven-dried samples than freeze-dried samples might be due to the reactivation of degradation enzymes in freeze-dried herbs or the release of phenolic compounds by the high heating temperature during vacuum oven-drying.

 <xref rid="B18-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] studied the influence of various drying conditions on the quality of two types of Lebanese 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> from Rkai and Ibrine regions. Solar drying, shade drying, and four drying treatments using forced air artificial dryers with two different temperatures (26 and 45 °C) and two different air speeds (0.1 and 0.2 m/s) were used. For both 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> types, the decrease in chlorophyll content was more noticeable at the high temperature of the solar drying and the dryers at 45 °C. On the other hand, there was not a noticeable loss in chlorophyll content at 26 °C with 0.2 m/s drying, followed by shade-drying, and then 26 °C with 0.1 m/s drying. It was reported that pheophytinization accounted for the loss of chlorophyll. There was a similar rate of thymol and carvacrol loss in both 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> types, and drying at 45 °C caused a lower loss than other drying treatments. The loss of polyphenols was found to be the highest after drying at 26 °C and 0.1 m/s and lowest after solar-drying and drying at 45 °C and 0.2 m/s. This might have resulted from the decomposition of some phenolic compounds by heat. This action produces other structures that increase the level of phenolic compounds after drying at a high temperature. Besides, drying at lower temperatures in shade-drying and drying at 26 °C showed a significant loss in polyphenols due to the prolonged time of drying. Shade-drying was the best method for preserving alpha-tocopherol in both 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> types. A great loss in all tocopherols was caused by drying at a high temperature. Moreover, drying at 0.1 m/s air speed was more advantageous than drying at 0.2 m/s. Higher losses of tocopherols in Ibrine type than Rkai type were observed after drying at 45 °C and 0.2 m/s. Similarly, the tocopherol content loss was also lower in Rkai type after drying at 45 °C and 0.1 m/s. It was suggested that those differences are due to the presence of iron or copper sulfate in Ibrine type, which can speed up tocopherol oxidation. Drying in shade is the most proper method to preserve tocopherols in both types of 
 <italic>O. syriacum,</italic> because the high temperature that increases the loss of tocopherols is not used in this method. Carotenoid loss rates were higher after drying at the higher temperatures in solar-drying and at 45 °C than drying at 26 °C. The loss of carotenoids was more pronounced in Rkai type. Carotenoids are easily decomposed in the presence of oxygen, light, and copper, and by the effect of temperature. Thus, solar-drying and drying at 45 °C resulted in higher losses of carotenoids than shade-drying and drying at 26 °C. Another reason behind the higher preservation of carotenoids in drying at a lower temperature is the lower oxidation of fat that produces peroxides that can destroy carotenoids. It was difficult to determine a favorable method of drying for the preservation of all the substances in the study.
