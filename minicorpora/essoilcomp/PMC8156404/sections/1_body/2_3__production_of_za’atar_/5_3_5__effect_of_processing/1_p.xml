<p>Limited data about the processing effects on za’atar quality attributes are available. In 
 <xref rid="plants-10-01001-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="plants-10-01001-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> we report the main effects on the product of pre- and post-harvesting conditions, respectively. The different stages in za’atar processing can influence its quality in different ways. It was found in a study that medium irrigation was the most proper irrigation level for 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic>. It also reported that air-drying was the best for preserving the aroma, flavor, and color compared to oven- and freeze-drying [
 <xref rid="B16-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Air-drying was also reported to be more favorable for preserving total phenols (TP) and antioxidant activity in herbs, including oregano, in a study compared to vacuum oven- and freeze-drying [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Another study found that drying at a lower temperature was better for preserving chlorophyll and carotenoids contents in 
 <italic>O. syriacum,</italic> while drying at a higher temperature produced 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> with higher phenols content. It was also reported that shade drying at lower air velocity was the best for preserving alpha-tocopherol content [
 <xref rid="B18-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Every processing method has its strengths and weaknesses, and every quality trait in za’atar responds differently to processing conditions. Therefore, more studies are required to fully understand how za’atar is affected by processing and which processing conditions can produce za’atar with optimum quality. Atallah et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] investigated the effect of different irrigation, drying, and production methods on the postharvest quality and economic feasibility of 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> growing in Lebanon. The resulting data collected during two summers showed that 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> height significantly and positively increased with irrigation frequency level from low to medium (66.3–73.2 cm) and from medium to high (73.2–81.5 cm). Similarly, branching increased with increasing irrigation level, reaching the maximum branching with medium irrigation level, and starting to reduce slowly beyond this level. Accumulation of dry matter as well was negatively affected by increased soil moisture. Therefore, it was suggested that medium irrigation water stress level is required for the prevention of reduced plant branching and dry matter accumulation. An increase of 1.7- and 2.2-fold was observed when increasing the irrigation level from low to medium. However, additional increases beyond medium level did not show more increases. Flower yield was increased by 2-fold in the high irrigation level but the validity of this conclusion is limited due to the high standard deviation of the flower yield data. The levels of thymol and carvacrol in the essential oil of 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> were not statistically different in the different irrigation levels. Drying of 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> was carried out by three different drying technologies: air-drying in a shaded area for 10 days at 25 °C and 45% relative humidity, oven-drying by convection oven at 30 °C for 47 h in 1.2 m/s air velocity and freeze-drying at 0 °C initial temperature for 48 h. The results of the sensory analysis of dried 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> revealed that air-dried 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> had a higher preservation of aroma and flavor than the oven- and freeze-dried 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic>. The flavor of air-dried 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> was marked as strong, bitter, pungent, warm, and astringent, while the aroma was marked as camphor-like, strong, and pungent. Freeze-dried 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> flavor and aroma received lower scores with increased undesired earthy and musty aroma. This could have resulted from the presence of sesquiterpenes in freeze-dried 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic>. Both oven- and freeze-drying would cause a loss of carvacrol in the essential oil of 
 <italic>O. syriacum,</italic> leading to the loss of the warm and pungent aroma and flavor. There were significant differences among color scores of air-, oven-, and freeze-dried 
 <italic>O. syriacum.</italic> According to the study experts, air-drying produced the desirable grayish-green color that is also required by the international standards. Financial analysis showed that the medium irrigation level and air-drying production scenario was not found to be economically feasible due to the high operation and maintenance costs, mainly. However, reducing the product positioning, e.g., by using low-value jars, might make this scenario economically feasible.
