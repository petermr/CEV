<p>Za’atar production practices include seedling propagation, cultivation in the field, weed and pest control, irrigation and fertigation, and finally, harvesting and processing. Za’atar has a very short shelf life that is only 2 days. Therefore, they must be stored away from heat and dry wind in order to keep their freshness [

Harvested za’atar must be handled in a proper way and stored in suitable clean bags and containers that are aerated. Drying should be carried out in a shaded, well-aerated area isolated from direct sunlight and any pollution source. Because harvesting for dried za’atar takes place in summer, the drying process may last from 2 to 3 weeks depending on the sunlight intensity and relative humidity in the drying area [

Once drying of za’atar is achieved, it can be stored for several months if the storage area is dry and isolated from moisture, sunlight, heat, and polluting substances. Dried za’atar can be manually or mechanically threshed [

Za’atar grinding is the next step after threshing and sieving dried flowers and leaves to further mix with other ingredients to produce the za’atar mix. Final storage of raw dried, threshed, and ground za’atar must be in hygienic conditions. Lastly, dried za’atar should be packed in clean, suitable packages made from materials that protect the product from moisture and prevent the loss of its volatiles without affecting it [
