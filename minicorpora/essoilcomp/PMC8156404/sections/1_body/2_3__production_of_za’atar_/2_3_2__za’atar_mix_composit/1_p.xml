<p>According to the Codex Alimentarius Commission Food and Agriculture Organization—World Health Organization, FAO–WHO, 2017 on za’atar mix standardization, there are three types of za’atar products: raw za’atar, raw broadleaf za’atar, and mixed za’atar. Raw za’atar products are composed of the leaves and/or blossoms of the wild and cultivated plant species: 
 <italic>Origanum</italic>, 
 <italic>Thymbra</italic>, 
 <italic>Thymus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Satureja</italic>. They could be mechanically or manually crumbled but they are not provided in a powder form. Raw broadleaf za’atar products are made of the leaves and/or blossoms of wild or cultivated broadleaf za’atar from the species 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> (by at least 75%) or as a constitute (by 25% maximum) in a mixture of leaves and blossoms of the varieties: 
 <italic>Origanum ehrenbergii</italic>, 
 <italic>Thymbra spicata</italic>, 
 <italic>Coridothymus capitatus</italic>, 
 <italic>Thymus syriacus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Satureia thymbra</italic>. Like raw za’atar, the mix could be manually or mechanically crumbled but it is not provided in a powder form. Mixed za’atar products are made of raw za’atar and raw broadleaf za’atar in addition to the husk sumac and sesame seeds. Other ingredients could also be added. Za’atar mix products are classified into three categories: Premium, Extra, and Regular mixed za’atar. Premium mixed za’atar must contain at least 25% broadleaf za’atar mixed with sumac husk and sesame seeds only. A maximum of 6% salt can be added. Extra mixed za’atar contains 20% broadleaf za’atar and raw za’atar mixed with sumac husk and sesame seeds. Grains, nuts, spices, and condiments could be added as well. Like Premium mixed za’atar, only a maximum of 6% salt can be added. Regular mixed za’atar composition is at least 15% broadleaf za’atar and raw za’atar mixed with at least 5% sumac husk and sesame seeds in addition to other ingredients. Regular za’atar mix can contain aromatic grains and herbs, legumes, pomegranate molasses, vegetable oil, wheat bran, sesame seed hull, spices, condiments, and nuts, all of which must meet good manufacturing practices.
