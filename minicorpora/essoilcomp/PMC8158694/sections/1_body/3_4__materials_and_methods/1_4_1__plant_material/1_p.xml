<p>The sampling for the micro-morphological, phytochemical and biological activity analyses was performed in late spring 2017 and early summer 2018 on a unique entity conserved at the Ghirardi Botanic Garden in Toscolano Maderno (Brescia, Italy). The amount of material collected was assessed on site, depending on the state of the plant and in accordance with the phase of its phenological cycle. Voucher specimens, labelled with the codes GBG2017/037 and GBG2018/056 and GBG2018/057, were stored in the Herbarium of the Ghirardi Botanic Garden.</p>
