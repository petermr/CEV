<p>Twofold serial microdilution method was used for the determination of the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values of essential oil against each strain. Essential oil was diluted with BHI (Brain Hearth Infusion—Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan, Italy) broth supplemented with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a solvent to a final ratio of 1:3:4 (EO:DMSO:BHI,
