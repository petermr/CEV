<p>The comparison between the essential oils from dried and fresh leaves evidenced some qualitative variations among the minor compounds, with the absence of 
 <italic>cis</italic>-sabinene hydrate 
 <italic>(17)</italic>, 
 <italic>α</italic>-terpinyl acetate (
 <italic>27</italic>) and 
 <italic>δ</italic>-cadinene (
 <italic>36</italic>) in 
 <italic>DL</italic>-EO. The increase of 1,8-cineole (
 <italic>13</italic>) was particularly significant, with the relative percentages moving from 46.6% in 
 <italic>FL</italic>-EO up to 63.6% in 
 <italic>DL</italic>-EO, and the concomitant decrease of 
 <italic>α</italic>-terpineol (
 <italic>22</italic>), from 13.6% in 
 <italic>FL</italic>-EO to only 1.1% in 
 <italic>DL</italic>-EO. This variation suggests that during the drying process biosynthetic transformation pathways can be established, as already reported in the literature for other plant species [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-10-01008" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This hypothesis was also supported by the evaluation of the relative amounts of both compounds in the essential oil profiles from leaves stored at −20 °C and −80 °C. In 
 <italic>FL80</italic>-EO, they showed concentrations comparable to those of the fresh samples (
 <xref rid="plants-10-01008-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), indicating that the transformation process was prevented. However, the storage at −20 °C seems not to be enough to prevent this process, since a slight increase in the amount of 1,8-cineole (
 <italic>13</italic>) was detected.
