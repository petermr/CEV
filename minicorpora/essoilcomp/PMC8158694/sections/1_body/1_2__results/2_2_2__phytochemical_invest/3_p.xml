<p>Firstly, considering the essential oil profiles from leaves subjected to different conservation procedures (
 <xref rid="plants-10-01008-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), a range of 16 (DL) to 19 (FL) total compounds were identified, with a prevalence of monoterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated derivatives. The most abundant compound was 1,8-cineole (
 <italic>13</italic>, 46.6–63.6%), followed by sabinene (
 <italic>4</italic>, 19.7–23.3%) and 
 <italic>α</italic>-terpineol 
 <italic>(22</italic>, 1.1–13.6%). The comparison between essential oils from fresh leaves and those derived from samples stored at low temperatures showed quantitative variations for all the detected 19 compounds. The most significant, even if limited, variation was found for 
 <italic>α</italic>-terpinene (
 <italic>8</italic>), with a relative abundance ranging from 0.4% in 
 <italic>FL</italic>-EO up to 0.9% in both the low-temperature storage methods, for 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene (
 <italic>16</italic>) (0.9% in 
 <italic>FL20</italic>-EO, 1.5% in 
 <italic>FL80</italic>-EO) and terpinen-
 <italic>4</italic>-ol (
 <italic>21</italic>) (1.7% in 
 <italic>FL</italic>-EO, 2.7% in 
 <italic>FL80</italic>-EO). Fresh leaves essential oil finally showed an exclusive compound, 
 <italic>cis</italic>-sabinene hydrate (
 <italic>17</italic>), present in very low amount (0.1%).
