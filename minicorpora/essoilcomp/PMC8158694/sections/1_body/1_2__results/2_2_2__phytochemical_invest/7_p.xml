<p>Concerning the bark essential oil, qualitative and quantitative differences emerged in comparison to the young stems profile. A relevant percentage of 1,8-cineole (
 <italic>13</italic>) (68.6%) was detected to be even higher than that of 
 <italic>DL</italic>-EO. The other main compounds were terpinen-4-ol (
 <italic>21</italic>) (6.2%) and 
 <italic>α</italic>-terpineol (
 <italic>22</italic>) (6.1%). The bark essential oil was also characterized by the occurrence of exclusive sesquiterpenes such as (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene (
 <italic>29</italic>), 
 <italic>α</italic>-humulene (
 <italic>30</italic>), spathulenol (
 <italic>38</italic>), humulene epoxide (
 <italic>40</italic>) and 
 <italic>epi</italic>-
 <italic>α</italic>-cadinol (
 <italic>41</italic>), all occurring in relative amounts lower than or equal to 0.3%, except for 
 <italic>α</italic>-humulene reaching 1.1%.
