<p>The 2017 essential oil, derived from the whole aerial parts (young stems, leaves and fruits), was obtained with a yield equal to 2.39%. Thirty-three different compounds were identified in total, with dominance of the monoterpene components, consisting mainly of oxygenated derivatives (63.0%), and to a minor extent, of hydrocarbons (29.0%); the minor fractions consisted of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (1.2%), oxygenated sesquiterpenes (3.0%), and phenylpropanoids (1.9%) (

To well understand the origin of these differences, in 2018, different plant aerial parts (leaves, young stems, bark, and fruits) were separately sampled and subjected to the drying process. Moreover, to evaluate whether the level of variability could depend on the preservation method, the leaves were subjected to different treatments before distillation: storage at −20 °C (
 <italic>FL20</italic>-EO), storage at −80 °C (
 <italic>FL80</italic>-EO), drying and storage at room temperature (
 <italic>DL</italic>), distillation as fresh material immediately after harvesting (
