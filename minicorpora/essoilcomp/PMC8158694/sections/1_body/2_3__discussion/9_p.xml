<p>Concerning the ecological roles, α-humulene is produced by

Safrole possesses antifungal properties, presumably to protect seeds; it occurs along with other compounds with xanthotoxin or additional toxic furanocoumarins in the plants of the families Apiaceae and Rutaceae. It was documented that these compounds have a phytosynergistic effect on the toxicity of xanthotoxin to
