<p>The comparison of the essential oilprofiles obtained from the other plant parts with the literature is less significant, due to the scarcity of contributions: Jiang et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-10-01008" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] investigated twigs and seeds; Shujiang et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-10-01008" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] studied branches and flowers, Stubbs et al. examined branches and trunk [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-10-01008" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Furthermore, all these works reported D-camphor as the main or second main essential oilcompound, suggesting that the examined plants belong to different chemotypes with respect to our samples.
