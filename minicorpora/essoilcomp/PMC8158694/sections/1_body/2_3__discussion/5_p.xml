<p>The comparison with literature data allowed us to point out some considerations. Most of the previous analyses on the leaf essential oil compositions revealed D-camphor as the main compound, with relative percentages ranging between 36.5% [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-10-01008" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and 73.8% [
 <xref rid="B5-plants-10-01008" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], both in dried samples [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-10-01008" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and in samples subjected to unspecified treatments [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-10-01008" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The work by Shujiang et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-10-01008" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], Chalchat and Valade [
 <xref rid="B18-plants-10-01008" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and Stubbs et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-10-01008" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] constituted exceptions, since the dominant compounds were represented by 
 <italic>endo</italic>-borneol, a D-camphor precursor, in the former, and 1,8-cineole in the latter two, respectively. If we considered the essential oil composition reported by Chalchat and Valade [
 <xref rid="B18-plants-10-01008" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], further qualitative and quantitative affinities emerged with the essential oil profile obtained herein from the dried leaves. The analysis of data reported in these two works showed that the relative amounts of most of the identified components had comparable concentrations. On this basis, although these authors did not report a detailed description of the preservation procedure of the plant material, it is reasonable to venture that the material was subjected to drying and stored at room temperature, following the most common practice. Therefore, we can assume that the species investigated herein belongs to the 1,8-cineole chemotype, since this compound dominated the profile, instead of D-camphor.
