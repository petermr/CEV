<p>For what concerns the biological activity of the three major common compounds across all the analyzed plant parts, 1,8-cineole, which accumulated in particular in the leaves after drying, plays a major role in the treatment of upper and lower airway diseases due to its anti-inflammatory properties, and appears to be active against antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant pathogens [
