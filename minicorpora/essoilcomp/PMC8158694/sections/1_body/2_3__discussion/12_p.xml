<p>Moreover, considering the antibacterial potential of essential oilss, a previous study on 
 <italic>C. camphora</italic> reported that the leaf essential oilfrom China is a good antibacterial agent, exhibiting a wide range of antibacterial activities against common bacteria, e.g., 
 <italic>Chromobacterium violaceum</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> [

 <italic>C. violaceum</italic>, and inhibited the biofilm formation and swarming movement, independent of affecting the bacterial growth. Moreover, several contributions from the literature [

 <xref rid="B58-plants-10-01008" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] report that the antibacterial activity of essential oils from different sources is primarily provided by the family of oxygenated monoterpenes, and in particular by 1,8-cineole. Due to its relative high abundance in essential oilss from 
 <italic>C. camphora</italic> investigated, the antibacterial action we found could be attributed to the preponderant presence of this compound.
