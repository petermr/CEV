<p>The micro-morphological and histochemical investigations performed on leaves and young stems of 
 <italic>C. camphora</italic> showed the presence of two types of secretory cells, oil cells and mucilage cells, with a distribution pattern consistent with the literature data. The investigation regarding the composition of the different layers of their wall allowed us to highlight the presence of a pectic-cellulosic layer and a suberin layer in both the cell types [
