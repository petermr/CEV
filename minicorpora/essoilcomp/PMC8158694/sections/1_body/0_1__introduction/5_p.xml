<p>Considering the current state of the art and the gaps in the scientific literature, we here performed a multi-scale survey on 
 <italic>C. camphora</italic>, cultivated in Northern Italy investigating: (i) the micromorphology and the histochemistry of the secretory structures of young stems and leaves; (ii) the phytochemistry through the characterization of the essential oil (EO) profiles from different plant parts and following different conservation procedures; and (iii) the antibacterial activity of the leaf essential oils.
