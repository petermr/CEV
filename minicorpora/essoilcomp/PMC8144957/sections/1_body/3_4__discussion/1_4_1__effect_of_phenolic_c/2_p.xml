<p>In addition to total and individual VFA, ammonia-N concentration was also measured, and was decreased by capsicum and thyme at low, medium, and high doses, and in cassia oil at high dose. Several studies reported that EO affect deamination and reduce ammonia-N concentration in the rumen [

 <xref rid="B34-animals-11-01205" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The mechanism of action has been attributed to the effect of EO on bacterial groups that intervene in deamination, like hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria and/or species of the

This effect is not beneficial, because ammonia-N concentration represents a loss of dietary nitrogen and a source of environmental pollution [
