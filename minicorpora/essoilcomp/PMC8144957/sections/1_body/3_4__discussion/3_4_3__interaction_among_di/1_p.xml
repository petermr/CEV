<p>Our hypothesis was that the combinations of EO at doses that would not have an effect alone would have additive or synergistic effects. For that, in the second experiment, three EO were selected. The selection criteria considered the potential interaction between different types of active compounds [
 <xref rid="B14-animals-11-01205" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. First, LEM containing citral as main active compound, is a monoterpene aldehyde that had positive effect on rumen fermentation in the first experiment. Coriander, containing linalool as main active compound was also selected as a monoterpene for its synergistic effect with phenolic compound [
 <xref rid="B14-animals-11-01205" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Ginger was selected because its main active compound (gingerols) are phenolics. Although in the first experiment ginger oil did not influence rumen microbial fermentation, we hypothesized that a mix of phenol and monoterpene may result in synergistic effect, and a mix of two monoterpenes, LEM and COR, may also result in additive effect. The determination of interactions between the three EO selected was tested using the Simplex Centroid Design. Our results showed the existence of interactions. Synergy means that the effect of the mixture is higher than the effect of the individual compounds [

 <xref rid="animals-11-01205-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>) for the two or the three mixed EO indicated that they interacted. Synergies were observed between LEM and COR, where the maximum for total VFA and the minimum for the A:P ratio were obtained by the mix of the two monoterpenes. In contrast, the addition of GIN to the mix decreased the total VFA and increased the A:P ratio suggesting an antagonistic effect of GIN versus LEM and COR on rumen fermentation. From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="animals-11-01205-f002">Figure 2</xref>a,b, the optimum proportion of each EO in the mix to maximize the surface response for total VFA ranges between 65 and 90% with a majority of COR completed by LEM, and to minimize the surface response of the A:P ratio, the optimum proportion ranges between 55 and 80% with a majority of COR completed by LEM also. The matching zone between these values ranges between 65 and 80% with a maximum of 80% for COR and a minimum of 65% for LEM and must obey other criteria such as price and availability in the market. Results obtained from the analyses of the Simplex Centroid Design, to explore possible additive effect between two monoterpenes and a synergy between a monoterpene and phenol, did not support this hypothesis which was based on the study of Bassolé et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-animals-11-01205" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] that observed an additive effect between monoterpenes and a synergy when using linalool and eugenol. In our case we observed a synergistic effect between two monoterpenes, LEM and COR, and an antagonistic effect when a phenol, GIN, was mixed with monoterpenes. Therefore, not all phenols can interact in the same way, and maybe the synergism found by Bassolé et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-animals-11-01205" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] was specific for eugenol. In another study, Fandiño et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-animals-11-01205" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] also reported antagonistic effect when clove bud oil was mixed with tea-tree, thyme, and (or) oregano oils. It is important to test the potential interactions between EO before mixing them to take advantage of the synergies and avoid the antagonistic effects.
