<p>Ruminal microbial fermentation can be modulated with the use of additives, resulting in improved efficiency of energy and protein utilization [
 <xref rid="B1-animals-11-01205" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Shifting ruminal fermentation profile toward more propionate and less acetate is more efficient and reduces the emission of methane [
 <xref rid="B2-animals-11-01205" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. For example, the addition of monensin increased propionate proportion, and decreased acetate and butyrate proportions, and therefore increase the efficiency of converting feed energy into energy in the acid end-products which are available for absorption [

 <xref rid="B5-animals-11-01205" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, since the ban on the use of antibiotics as growth promoters in animal feeds in the European Union in 2006 [
 <xref rid="B6-animals-11-01205" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] the interest has focused on natural alternatives. Essential oils (EO) are the aromatic volatile fraction of plant secondary metabolites generally recognized as safe for human and animal consumption [
 <xref rid="B7-animals-11-01205" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Essential oils are characterized by their active compounds included in two main chemical groups: terpenoids and phenylpropanoids [
 <xref rid="B7-animals-11-01205" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-animals-11-01205" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Numerous studies have demonstrated the ability of EO and their main active components to shift rumen microbial fermentation profile [

 <xref rid="B10-animals-11-01205" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-animals-11-01205" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Many plant extract additives in the market are based on combinations of several EO However, evidence of their possible additivity, synergistic or antagonistic effects is very limited, and only Fandiño et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-animals-11-01205" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] recently reported a negative interaction of clove bud when mixed with thyme or oregano oils on ruminal microbial fermentation. Tserennadmid et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-animals-11-01205" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] observed a synergy between α-pinene and limonene, two monoterpenes. Bassolé et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-animals-11-01205" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] observed a synergy between the monoterpene linalool and the phenolic compound eugenol. In contrast, Gallucci et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-animals-11-01205" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] observed an antagonistic effect between thymol and carvacrol, two phenolic compounds. However, all these studies on synergistic-antagonistic effects among EO have been conducted in the field of cosmetics and food processing [
 <xref rid="B16-animals-11-01205" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-animals-11-01205" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Only few studies have been specifically designed to prove additivity, synergistic or antagonistic effects of EO on rumen microbial fermentation. Recently, Fandiño et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-animals-11-01205" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] addressed this issue in high concentrate feedlot-type fermentation conditions and found an antagonistic effect when clove bud oil was mixed with tea-tree, thyme and (or) oregano oils. Our hypothesis was that the combination of EO at doses that would not have an effect when supplemented alone would have additive or synergistic effects when supplemented together. The objective of the present study is to explore additive, synergistic or antagonistic effects among EO to increase propionate and decrease acetate concentrations, and reduce the acetate to propionate ratio.
