<p>After 24 h of fermentation, final pH was measured with a pH meter (sensION+, HACH Company, Barcelona, Spain), and samples were collected for VFA (volatile fatty acids) and ammonia-N concentration analyses. Samples for VFA were analyzed by liquid chromatography. For that, 100 µL of sample was added to 50 µL of 2N HCl and shaken with a multivortex shaker for 5 s. Then, 1 mL of chloroform was added and shaken for 1 min again and centrifuged at 15,000×

 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 4 °C. The aqueous phase (0.4 mL) was collected, 50 µL of 2N HCl were added, shaken with a multivortex shaker for 5 min and centrifugated at 14,500×

The HPLC system (HPLC 1100 series, Walldbroom, Germany) was composed of a quaternary pump, an automated injector, a column (Agilent, Sta. Clara, CA, USA) oven, and a UV detector. Branch-chained VFA were calculated as the sum of isobutyric and isovaleric acids. Ammonia-N concentration was analyzed as described by Chaney and Marbach [

 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 7 °C, and the supernatant was analyzed by spectrophotometry (Libra S21, Biochrom Technology, Cambridge, UK).
