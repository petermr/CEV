<p>The experiment was conducted in in vitro batch fermentation conditions [
 <xref rid="B21-animals-11-01205" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Rumen fluid was collected at a slaughterhouse from four dairy cows in each period, filtered through four layers of cheesecloth, mixed and transported to the laboratory in thermos with no headspace. The rumen fluid was pooled and added to a phosphate-bicarbonate buffer [
 <xref rid="B22-animals-11-01205" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] in a 1:1 proportion, purged with N
 <sub>2</sub>, and adjusted to an initial pH of 6.6. The diet used was a 50:50 forage to concentrate dairy cow diet with 17.9% crude protein, 30% neutral detergent fiber, and 21% acid detergent fiber, dry matter (DM) basis, and consisted (DM basis) of alfalfa hay (50.3%), ground barley grain (19.1%), ground corn grain (19.1%), soybean meal (10.9%), and a vitamin-mineral dairy cow premix (0.6%). The diet was designed to meet or exceed nutrient recommendations for a Holstein cow (650 kg) producing 30 kg of milk [

Incubations were conducted in 110-mL polypropylene tubes containing 50 mL of culture fluid with 0.5 g of the diet cited above ground through a 1-mm screen (Cyclotec CT 293, Foss, Barcelona, Spain). Treatments included a negative control without additive (CTR), monensin as a positive control (MON; Sigma-Aldrich Chemical, St. Louis, MO, USA), a blank without additive nor diet, and each of the 12 EO with the diet at three doses: low, medium, and high (
 <xref rid="animals-11-01205-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). All essential oils were dissolved in ethanol in different proportions to reach the appropriate dose, and a total of 0.2 mL was added to the culture fluid in each tube. The equivalent amount of ethanol (0.2 mL) was added to the control and the blank. Each treatment was used in triplicate at each dose, and fermentations were replicated in two independent periods. Anaerobiosis was ensured by the addition of N
 <sub>2</sub> before sealing tubes with rubber stoppers. Incubations were conducted at 39 Â°C in a thermoregulated water bath.
