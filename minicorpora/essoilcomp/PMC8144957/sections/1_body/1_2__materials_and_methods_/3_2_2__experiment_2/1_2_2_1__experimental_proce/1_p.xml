<p>Lemongrass (LEM), coriander (COR), and ginger (GIN) oils were chosen from the first experiment and used in different proportions according to the Simplex Centroid Design for experiments with mixtures ( [

The midpoints of the sides of the triangle correspond to 1:1 mixture of two essential oils. The center point of the triangle represents the three-component mixture in equal portions. Axial mixtures using different proportions were also investigated. These ten mixtures with different proportions of each component in the mix were prepared at a total of 75 mg/L for a low dose and a total of 150 mg/L for a high dose (

All EO were diluted in ethanol, and the control and the blank were also dosed with the equivalent amount of ethanol (0.2 mL). Fermentation conditions were the same as described in experiment 1. The incubations were conducted in triplicate and in two independent periods. At 24 h of fermentation, the final pH and samples for VFA and ammonia-N concentrations were collected and analyzed as described in the first experiment.
