<p>In general, the majority of EO screened in this experiment and monensin did not modify the rumen fermentation profile (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-animals-11-01205">Supplementary Table S1–S6</xref>). The average concentration for total VFA was 74.0 ± 7.13. mM, for acetate proportion was 51.5 ± 1.92 mol/100 mol, for propionate proportion was 17.38 ± 1.58 mol/100 mol, for butyrate proportion was 20.0 ± 2.72 mol/100 mol, and for the A:P ratio was 3.07 ± 0.43. Total VFA concentration tended to increase only with the low dose of thyme oil. None of the doses of EO tested affected the acetate molar proportion. Only lemongrass oil at low dose tended to increase propionate proportion and tended to decrease the A:P ratio. Thyme oil at medium dose increased butyrate molar proportion. Coriander oil at low and high doses, and anise star oil at high dose tended to increase butyrate molar proportion. No effect of EO was observed on branch-chained VFA molar proportion. The effect of EO on ammonia-N is reported in 
 <xref rid="animals-11-01205-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Capsicum, coriander, and thyme oils decreased ammonia-N concentration at low, medium, and high doses. Limonene tended to decrease ammonia-N concentration at medium and high doses. Cassia oil also tended to decrease ammonia-N concentration at high dose. However, geraniol increased ammonia-N concentration at low, medium, and high doses, and cassia oil tended to increase ammonia-N concentration at low and medium doses.
