<p>The sum of the squares of the prediction error (PRESS) was low for all the outcomes (
 <xref rid="animals-11-01205-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>), which reflects the fit of the model used in this analysis. This precision of prediction indicates that the model represented correctly the response surface. Also, the high value of the R
 <sup>2</sup> for all the outcomes (average R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.98) indicates that the model was adequate for the analysis of the response surface.
