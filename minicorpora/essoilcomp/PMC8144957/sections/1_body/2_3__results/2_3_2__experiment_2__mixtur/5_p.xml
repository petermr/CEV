<p>The three EO used individually decreased acetate, tended to decrease the A:P ratio, and increased propionate and butyrate molar proportions (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="animals-11-01205-f002">Figure 2</xref>b shows that the lowest A:P ratio was observed when the mixture is formed by LEM and COR in a range of 55â€“80% with a maximum of 80% for the COR and completed with 20% of LEM. In contrast, the addition of high doses of GIN increased the A:P ratio suggesting an antagonistic interaction of GIN versus LEM+COR. There were no synergies among the three EO on ammonia-N concentration. The lower value of ammonia-N was observed with COR used alone (
