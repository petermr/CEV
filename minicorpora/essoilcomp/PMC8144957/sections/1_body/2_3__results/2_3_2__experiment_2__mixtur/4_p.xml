<p>Within the Simplex Centroid Design treatments, the three EO used individually increased total VFA, where the highest value was observed in COR followed by LEM and GIN. The significant coefficient of total VFA (
 <xref rid="animals-11-01205-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>) for the mix containing equal proportion of LEM and COR indicated that the two EO were synergistic in increasing total VFA concentration. This synergism is also illustrated in the left part of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="animals-11-01205-f002">Figure 2</xref>a where the maximum of total VFA was observed when the mixture is formed by LEM and COR in a range of 65â€“90% with a maximum of 90% for the COR and completed with 10% of LEM. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="animals-11-01205-f002">Figure 2</xref>a also shows that increasing the proportion of GIN in the mixture decreased total VFA concentration, and, therefore, has an antagonistic effect when mixed with LEM and COR.
