<p>In the first screening, the use of EO individually had small effects on rumen microbial fermentation. In the second experiment the use of the Simplex Centroid Design demonstrated a synergistic effect between LEM and COR to increase the total VFA concentration and propionate proportion, and to decrease the A:P ratio. However, an antagonistic effect was also observed when GIN oil was added at high doses to the LEM + COR mixture suggesting that only low doses should be used to optimize the ruminal fermentation. This study reveals the importance of taking into consideration the existence of positive and negative interactions among EO.</p>
