 <caption>
  <p>The two-dimensional contour plots for (
   <bold>a</bold>) total volatile fatty acids (VFA, mM) and (
   <bold>b</bold>) the acetate to propionate (A:P) ratio. The three vertices of the triangle represent individual essential oils: lemongrass = LEM, coriander = COR, and ginger = GIN. The contour plot provides a 2-dimensional view where all points that have the same response are connected by a line of constant responses.
