 <italic>L. camara</italic> is a perennial shrub, but senescent leaves are replaced by new leaves [
 <xref rid="B3-plants-10-01028" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-plants-10-01028" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Those dropped leaves accumulate on the soil under the canopy and form a litter layer. Some of the secondary metabolites in the leaves may be liberated into rhizosphere soil during the decomposition process of the litter and act as allelochemicals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-01028-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Allelochemicals are able to inhibit germination, seedling establishment, and plant growth of other plant species [
 <xref rid="B29-plants-10-01028" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-plants-10-01028" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-plants-10-01028" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A substantial number of allelochemicals were identified in the 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> leaves (
 <xref rid="plants-10-01028-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In addition, the decomposition rate of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> litter was faster than that of the leaf litter of native plant species [
 <xref rid="B68-plants-10-01028" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. In fact, lantadene A and lantadene B, which were isolated from the leaves, were also found in the rhizosphere soil of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> over growth-inhibitory levels [
 <xref rid="B58-plants-10-01028" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The concentration of total phenolic compounds in the rhizosphere soil of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> was 27.6% higher than that in the soil of the uninvaded area of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> [
 <xref rid="B69-plants-10-01028" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Phenolic compounds are often mentioned as putative allelochemicals, as they have been found in a wide range of plants and soils [
 <xref rid="B70-plants-10-01028" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,
 <xref rid="B71-plants-10-01028" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The inhibitory activity of most phenolic compounds is concentration dependent. Phenolic compounds interfere with several enzyme activities and almost all of the major physiological processes, such as phytohormone functions, mineral uptake, water balance and stomatal functions, photosynthesis, respiration, and the metabolism of certain compounds and flow carbons [
 <xref rid="B70-plants-10-01028" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,
 <xref rid="B72-plants-10-01028" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Those observations indicate that allelochemicals in 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> litter may be released into rhizosphere soil during the decomposition process.
