<p>The invasion of

 <italic>Albizia lebbeck</italic> (L.) Benth. Is an indigenous plant species in Siwalik Hills in northern India, but no seedling was observed in the 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> invaded areas. 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> suppressed the growth and seedling recruitment of almost all native plant species under its canopy [

 <italic>L. camara</italic> also significantly suppressed the growth of native plant species 
 <italic>Achyranthes aspera</italic> L. [

 <italic>L. camara</italic> [
 <xref rid="B3-plants-10-01028" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These observations suggest that the rhizosphere soil of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> may contain some allelochemicals that disturb the regeneration process of native plant species by decreasing their germination and seedling growth and increasing their mortality.
