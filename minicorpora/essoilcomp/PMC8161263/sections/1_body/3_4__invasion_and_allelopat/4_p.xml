<p>The characteristics of life history, such as high reproduction and high growth rate of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic>, are essential to the success of the invasion into nonnative ranges [

 <xref rid="B16-plants-10-01028" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-plants-10-01028" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The genetic diversity of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> is crucial for phenotypic plasticity to adapt to different environmental conditions [

 <xref rid="B12-plants-10-01028" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-plants-10-01028" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Competitive ability is also one of the essential factors for 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> to naturalize and establish dense monospecies stands in nonnative ranges [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-10-01028" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-plants-10-01028" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,

 <xref rid="B4-plants-10-01028" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. As described previously, 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> interrupts the regeneration process of indigenous plant species by decreasing their germination, reducing their seedling growth, and increasing their mortality. 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> is allelopathic, and its allelopathic property may help the invasion of this species into nonnative ranges. In addition, the elevated temperature increased the allelopathy of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> [
 <xref rid="B75-plants-10-01028" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], which indicates that global warming may increase the threat of the invasion of the species into additional nonnative areas.
