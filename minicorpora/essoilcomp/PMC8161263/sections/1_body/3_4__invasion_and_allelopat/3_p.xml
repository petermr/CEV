<p>Many of the phytotoxic substances from the invasive plants have been reported to have multiple functions, such as anti-pathogen, anti-herbivore, and allelopathic activity [

 <xref rid="B74-plants-10-01028" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Those compounds probably provide the plants with the advantage of increasing their population in the new habitats. A large number of secondary metabolites have been isolated from the extracts of different parts of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic>, including monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, triterpenes, iridoid glycosides, flavonoids, and phenylethanoid glycosides, and some of them were reported to possess anti-microbial, anti-insect, and pharmacological activities. [
