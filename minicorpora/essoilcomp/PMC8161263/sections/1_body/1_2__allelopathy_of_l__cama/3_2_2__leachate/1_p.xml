<p>Shoots and flowers of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> were cut into small pieces and soaked in water for 48 h. Filtered water was used as the leachates of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic>. The leachates inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>Eichhornia crassipes</italic> Mart. and finally killed 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> 21 days after the treatment due to its high toxicity [

 <xref rid="B45-plants-10-01028" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Leachates from 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> leaves suppressed the germination and seedling growth of 
 <italic>Mimosa pudica</italic> L. The concentrations of insoluble carbohydrate, proteins, and nucleic acids and the activities of dehydrogenase, catalase, and peroxidase in the seedlings were reduced by the leachates. However, the concentrations of amino acids and soluble carbohydrates were increased by the treatment [

 <xref rid="B47-plants-10-01028" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Root leachates of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> inhibited the radical growth of 
 <italic>Cucurbita pepo</italic> Linnaeus, 
 <italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic> L., and 
 <italic>Lycopersicon esculentum</italic> Mill. and altered the cytoplasmic protein synthesis in those radicals [

 <italic>L. camara</italic> roots also suppressed the germination and seedling vigor of 
 <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L. [
 <xref rid="B49-plants-10-01028" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Leachates from fruits and leaves of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> significantly inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>Pennisetum americanum</italic> (L.) Tzvelev, 
 <italic>Setaria italica</italic> (L.) P. Beauvois, and 
 <italic>Lactuca sativa</italic> L. [
 <xref rid="B50-plants-10-01028" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. These observations suggest that some allelochemicals may be released into the soil under the trees from the leaves, shoots, flowers, fruits, and roots of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> by rain and irrigation water as leachates.
