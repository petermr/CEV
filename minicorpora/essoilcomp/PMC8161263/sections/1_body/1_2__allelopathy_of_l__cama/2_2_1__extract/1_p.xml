<p>Aqueous leaf extracts of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> inhibited the germination of 
 <italic>Lactuca sativa</italic> L. due to the suppression of cellular membrane developments and increase in the production of reactive oxygen forms [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-10-01028" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Aqueous leaf extracts of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> suppressed the development of leaf buds of 
 <italic>Eichhornia crassipes</italic> Mart., increased the decay, and caused necrosis of 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> leaves. The extracts also increased SOD activity in the leaves of 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> concomitant with H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> accumulation and increased the membrane peroxidation level. The activity of catalase was decreased by the extract treatments. These observations indicate that leaf necrosis of 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> may occur due to the oxidative stress caused by leaf extracts of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> [
