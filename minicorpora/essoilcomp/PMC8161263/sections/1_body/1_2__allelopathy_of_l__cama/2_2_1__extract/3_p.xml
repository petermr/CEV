<p>Aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> flowers suppressed the germination and seedling growth of 
 <italic>Eruca sativa</italic> (L.) Cav. [

 <italic>Raphanus sativus</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Lactuca sativa</italic> L. The inhibitory effect was more significant with flower and fruit extracts than leaf extracts [

 <italic>L. camara</italic> also inhibited the germination and growth of 
 <italic>Lolium multiflorum</italic> Lam. [
 <xref rid="B43-plants-10-01028" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The observations described in this section indicate that the extracts of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> possess inhibitory activity on the germination and growth of several other plant species and probably contain some extractable allelochemicals.
