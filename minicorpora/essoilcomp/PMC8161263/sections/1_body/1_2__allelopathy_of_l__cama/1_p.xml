<p>Allelopathy is the interaction of one plant with another plant in its vicinity through releasing certain secondary metabolites, which are defined as allelochemicals [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-10-01028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The allelochemicals are released into the neighboring environments and rhizosphere soil of the plants by rainfall leachates, decomposition of plant residues, root exudation, and volatilization from living plant parts [

 <italic>L. camara</italic> was evaluated by many researchers. In this chapter, the allelopathic potential of the extracts, leachates, residues, and rhizosphere soil of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> is summarized (
