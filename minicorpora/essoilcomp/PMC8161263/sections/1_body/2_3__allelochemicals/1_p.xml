<p>Aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> leaves inhibited the germination and seedling growth of 
 <italic>Lolium multiflorum</italic> Lam., and 13 phenolic compounds were identified in the extracts. Those compounds were caffeic acid, gentisic acid, 
 <italic>p</italic>-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, salicylic acid, ferulic acid, 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid, methyl coumarin, α-resorcylic acid, β-resorcylic acid, vanillin, and quercetin. All compounds inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>L. multiflorum.</italic> The inhibitory activity of salicylic acid and methyl coumarin was more significant than that of other compounds [

 <italic>L. camara</italic> leaves also inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>Lemna minor</italic> L., and 14 phenolic compounds: caffeic acid, gentisic acid,
