<p>Lantadene A and lantadene B were isolated from aqueous methanol extracts of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> leaves as allelochemicals [
 <xref rid="B58-plants-10-01028" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Both compounds were first isolated as toxic substances in 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> [
 <xref rid="B59-plants-10-01028" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Lantadene A and lantadene B inhibited 
 <italic>Eichhornia a</italic> Mart. and 
 <italic>Microcystis aeruginosa</italic> (Kützing) Kützing at concentrations greater than 13.7 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> and 10.8 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. Lantadene A and lantadene B were also found in rhizosphere soil of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> at phytotoxic active levels [
 <xref rid="B58-plants-10-01028" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The concentrations of those compounds varied by the geographical origin of the plants between trace amounts to 2.2% of leaves’ dry weight [

 <xref rid="B61-plants-10-01028" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Methanol extracts of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> leaves also inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>Phalaris minor</italic> Retz, 
 <italic>Avena fatua</italic> L., 
 <italic>Chenopodium album</italic> L., and 
 <italic>Rumex dentatus</italic> L., and the flavone glucoside vitexin was isolated from the extracts as an allelochemical of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> [
