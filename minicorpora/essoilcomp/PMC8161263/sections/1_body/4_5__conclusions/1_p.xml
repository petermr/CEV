 <italic>L. camara</italic> is very invasive and often forms dense monospecies stands through the interruption of the regeneration process of native plant species by decreasing their germination and seedling growth and increasing their mortality. The evidence summarized in this paper indicates that 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> is allelopathic (
 <xref rid="plants-10-01028-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and contains several allelochemicals, such as phenolic compounds, sesquiterpenes, triterpenes, and a flavonoidÂ (
 <xref rid="plants-10-01028-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The evidence also suggests that some of those allelochemicals in 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> are probably released into the rhizosphere soil under its canopy and neighboring environments during the decomposition process of its residues and as leachates and volatile compounds from living plant parts of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-01028-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Allelochemicals can inhibit the germination and growth of other plant species. Therefore, the allelochemicals released from 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> may provide the species with a competitive advantage against the native plants and may also suppress the regeneration process of native plant species and contribute to establishing their habitats as invasive plant species. However, it is essential to specify the allelochemical and to clarify its release process and quantity into the neighboring environments to understand the invasion and formation of dense monospecies stands of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic>.
