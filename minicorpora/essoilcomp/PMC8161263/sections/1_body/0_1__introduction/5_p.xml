<p>The formation of dense monospecies stands of 
 <italic>L. camara,</italic> as described above, indicates its highly competitive ability with other plant species. Perennial plants may be able to release allelochemicals into the soil over several years, and those allelochemicals may accumulate in the soil under the trees [

 <italic>L. camara</italic> possibly releases allelochemicals into the soil under its canopy. Those allelochemicals cause a reduction in seedling recruitment of the native plant species. Subsequently, 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> forms dense monospecies stands. Therefore, allelopathy may play a crucial role in the 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> invasion and formation of monospecies stands. The objective of this review is to discuss the possible involvement of allelopathy in the invasion and establishment of 
 <italic>L. camara.</italic> This review paper provides an overview of the allelopathic property and allelochemicals of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> and discusses the importance of allelopathy for the invasion and formation of dense monospecies stands of 
 <italic>L. camara.</italic>
