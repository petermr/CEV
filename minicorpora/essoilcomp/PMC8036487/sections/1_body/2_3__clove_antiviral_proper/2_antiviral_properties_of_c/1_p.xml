<p>Eugenol (4-allyl-2-methoxyphenol; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01880-f002">Figure 2</xref>), being the major constituent of cloves, was investigated for its antiviral activity by several research groups. The above-mentioned Tragoolpua and Jatisatienr [
 <xref rid="B101-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>] used pure eugenol as the reference compound in their anti-HSV studies and found that it exerted a higher antiviral activity than the ethanol extracts of whole clove buds. Similar findings were obtained by Benencia and Courreges [
 <xref rid="B103-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>], who reported the eugenol inhibition of HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication with inhibitory concentration 50% (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) values of 25.6 µg/mL and 16.2 µg/mL, respectively. In the same study, eugenol was virucidal, whilst no compound-associated cytotoxicity was revealed at the concentrations tested [
