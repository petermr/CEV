<p>Eugeniin was also found to act as a potent inhibitor of the protease of Dengue virus (DENV), which causes infections in tropical and subtropical regions of the world for which there are still no specific antiviral treatments available [
 <xref rid="B107-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of eugeniin against the proteases of DENV serotype-2 and -3 were 94.7 nM and 7.5 Î¼M, respectively. Thus, in consideration of the importance of DENV protease for the viral replication cycle, eugeniin was proposed as a promising drug in the context of anti-DENV therapeutics development [

The atomic-level details of the binding of these three clove phytochemicals to the viral protease were obtained by computational docking and saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR spectroscopy, which showed that the molecular recognition at the active site of the DENV protease involved networks of hydrophobic contacts and hydrogen bonds [
