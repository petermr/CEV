<p>Clove is one of the medicinal plants currently employed to prevent and control the SARS-CoV-2-associated disease, together with

 <italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic>, 
 <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic>, and other plants endowed with the advantage of being inexpensive and abundantly available around the globe [

More in detail, a protocol for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 using cloves, as medicinal plant, was described by Kanyinda, J.N. M., who reported a proven effect for the treatment provided that it was carried out in the early stages of the disease [
 <xref rid="B108-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. The protocol included the preparation of a decoction in which cloves are boiled in water with other plant materials for 15 min. The released volatile active principles are then inhaled by patients for five minutes. The same protocol also included a drinkable decoction obtained with cloves and other plant materials [

Interestingly, more than 93% of the interviewed Indian people believed that spices are helpful in curing COVID-19 or other viral infections and can help in boosting the immunity. Cloves are mentioned as one of the most frequently used spices and herbs during the current COVID-19 pandemic in the areas under investigation, together with other plants like cinnamon, ginger, black pepper, garlic, neem, and basil [

 <xref rid="B114-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>], and one of them, kaempferol, was shown in silico to bind the substrate binding pocket of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 with high affinity interacting with the active site residues such as Cys145 and His41 through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding, suggesting that natural compounds such as clove flavonoids could act as novel inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="B115-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. Molecular docking studies have also shown high affinities of clove compounds bicornin (−9.2 kcal/mol) and biflorin (−8.5 kcal/mol) for M
