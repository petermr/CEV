<p>Coronaviridae is a family of enveloped RNA viruses known as Coronaviruses (CoVs) that provoke infections in animals and humans [

 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Presently, seven human coronaviruses (HCoVs), commonly considered of zoonotic origin, are described in the scientific literature [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] that cause infections mainly associated with respiratory symptoms [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. More in detail, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1 are “common cold” coronaviruses causing seasonal, usually mild, respiratory diseases [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although, in most cases, these HCoVs do not lead to severe clinical symptoms, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 infections can provoke bronchiolitis and croup [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], whilst CoV 229E and OC43 can provoke pneumonia [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Nonetheless, three highly pathogenic HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades, i.e., Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], which can lead to life-threatening pathologic events associated with the recent MERS, SARS, and the current COronaVIrus Disease 19 (COVID-19), which is causing enormous problems globally in both sanitary and socioeconomic terms [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV are more lethal than SARS-CoV-2, but this latter is more transmissible, explaining the current pandemic status of COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In the first step of coronavirus infection, a specific molecular recognition between the virus particle, through the virus spike (S) protein, and the host cell takes place, involving different HCoV-specific receptors [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,

 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] that were identified for several CoVs and are considered one of the primary targets for anti-CoV biomedical strategies together with the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M

 <xref rid="B28-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The receptors for the “common cold” HCoVs are human aminopeptidase N (APN), associated with the infection from HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid (9-O-Ac-Sia), used by HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. On the other hand, the receptor for HCoV-NL63, i.e., angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is also common to the more pathogenic SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, whilst dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) was associated with MERS-CoV [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Once intracellular, all HCoVs replicate their RNA with the consequent expression of the viral proteins needed for the production of new viral particles inside the infected cell [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. As anticipated, four out of the seven HCoVs are associated with usually mild upper respiratory infections, whilst MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1 and -2 can cause lethal events [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This latter, first emerging in China at the end of 2019 [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], can lead to severe pneumonia and, being easily transmissible, has spread worldwide rapidly, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare COVID-19 a pandemic [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Currently, there are more than two million deaths (2,566,793, as found in Worldometers.info [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] accessed on 3 March 2021) worldwide due to COVID-19, with enormous consequences for the public health and the economy worldwide [

 <xref rid="B36-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. While the whole world is fighting against COVID19 and awaits an effective mass immunization, the scientific community is devoting immense efforts toward developing specific therapies for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, since inflammatory cytokine storms together with immune system impairment are commonly observed in patients with severe COVID-19, several research studies have highlighted the advantages of dual therapies with antiviral and anti-inflammatory benefits [

 <xref rid="B42-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and herbal medicine are two of the most considered anti-COVID-19 approaches [

 <xref rid="B47-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In fact, several plants such as mulberry, tea, and Dragon’s Blood tree are known as remedies to treat respiratory ailments and for their anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic properties, which are useful aspects in the fight against COVID-19 [
