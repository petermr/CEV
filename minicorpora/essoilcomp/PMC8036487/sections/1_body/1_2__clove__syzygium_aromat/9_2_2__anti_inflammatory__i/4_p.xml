<p>Clove is mentioned to improve the blood supply to both the brain and the heart and is used as a tonic for the cardiovascular system [
 <xref rid="B82-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Moreover, clove oil was shown to inhibit the platelet aggregation induced by the platelet-activating factor, arachidonic acid, and collagen, with a higher activity observed in the first two systems than the latter [
 <xref rid="B74-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. In vivo experiments carried out on rabbits showed that clove oil at 50â€“100 mg/kg doses afforded total protection against the platelet-activating factor and good (70%) protection against arachidonic acid-induced shock due to pulmonary platelet thrombosis [
