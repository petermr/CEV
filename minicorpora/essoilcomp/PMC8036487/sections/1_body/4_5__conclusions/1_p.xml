<p>The therapeutic use of cloves in traditional medicine to treat respiratory ailments and its experimentally proven activity against different types of viruses, as well its anti-inflammatory, immunostimulatory, and antithrombotic properties, all concur to compose a picture of the potential importance of cloves and their phytochemical constituents in the fight against the COVID-19 disease. Aside from the above-mentioned features, clove essential oil has shown remarkable antibacterial effects against the infections of immunosuppressed hospitalized patients [

In conclusion, cloves, a precious spice largely used in countries where the impact of the novel coronavirus is lower than the Western world, are endowed with medicinal properties considered relevant in the prevention and therapy of COVID-19. Future clinical data on the activity of cloves and their constituents on COVID-19 patients and more molecular insights on the specific clove phytochemical interactions with SARS-CoV-2 protein targets are clearly desirable in order to realize the effective therapeutic protocols and design new drugs based on clove phytochemicals with optimized characteristics.
