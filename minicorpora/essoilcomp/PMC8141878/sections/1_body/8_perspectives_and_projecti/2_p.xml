<p id="p0275">Based on the available literature and gaps present with respect to ethnopharmacology, pharmacology, and phytochemistry of 
 <italic>T.Â vulgaris</italic> L., a few perspectives and future projections could be drawn out. Though a tremendous amount of ethnobotanical literature is present, it lacks specifications in terms of plant material, plant parts, and extracts used in ancient times. With these foundational evidences, concrete modern-day pharmacological approaches could be used, thereby supporting the vital claims by the previous generation that in turn could be used in drug discovery. Pharmacological findings need to be supported by the mechanisms. The action of plant extracts and individual compounds need to be defined at the molecular level to find more druggable targets, which can further be used to design a specific drug. Moreover, these studies have used multicomponent assays with varying concentrations, which complicate the determination of specific dose. Thus, qualitative and quantitative assays using individual compounds in a dose-dependent manner and a combination approach could reduce the burden of multifactorial results. Isolated compounds from the plant extracts could be further modified according the requirement based on cytotoxic evaluations done in primary screening. Such compounds could be analysed 
 <italic>in silico</italic> for effective binding and inhibitory effect on specific component or any part of the identified target. Further, the bioavailability of the compounds could be dealt to modify the compound to match the physiological conditions of the target organ. Usage of 
 <italic>in silico</italic> methods like molecular modelling and docking can save a lot of animals, which are used in laboratories.
