 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. is considered as a culinary herb and has been extensively used since time immemorial in Europe and Mediterranean. In all the records of ethnomedicinal properties, there is no mention of toxic effects. Moreover, it has been described as the most used herb by the physician Dioscorides in the 2nd century [
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In support of this, present-day studies report no cytotoxic activities of either the extracts or oil. A 28-day oral dose toxicity assessment of thyme oil in rats was conducted in single (2,000 mg/kg) and repeated dose (100, 250, and 500 mg/kg/day) methods, where no signs of toxicity were detected. Even with the administration of 500 mg/kg/day, the body weight was found to be altered, yet with no toxicity observed even on 28th day [

(2014) assessed the activity of thyme essential oil and found no histopathological changes in the rat liver and kidney, except a few metabolic changes including increase in urea nitrogen, creatinine and uric acid levels. Besides this, alterations in glycolysis, β-oxidative pathways, Kreb's cycle were also observed. In total, this study revealed that injection of repeated doses of thyme oil results in a few intermediary metabolic disturbances with no cytotoxic activities [

 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. plant extracts and oil possess no cytotoxic activity though there are reported cases of mild metabolic changes.
