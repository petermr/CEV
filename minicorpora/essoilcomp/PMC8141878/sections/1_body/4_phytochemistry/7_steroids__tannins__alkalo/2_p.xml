<p id="p0115">A study that used HPTLC to assess the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>T.Â vulgaris</italic> L. documented the presence of 9 alkaloids, 14 saponins, 12 steroids, and 8 tannins. The study revealed a good resolution with 10 bands of essential oils, along with bands corresponding to tannins (9.2%) and saponins (23.1%), where a remarkable antimicrobial activity is possessed by saponins [

As most of the chemical components belong to essential oils and phenolic compounds, metabolites like steroids, tannins, alkaloids, and saponins have not been evaluated in detail. Therefore, it now becomes essential to focus on these compounds to reveal their biological significance.
