<p id="p0210">Thyme oil in the form of vapour and liquid was found to be effective against the influenza virus. However, partial activity was observed in vapour phase, whereas the liquid phase at 3.1 μl/ml concentration completely inhibited the viral growth, which was better than that of control used (canola oil). In addition, the researchers also evaluated the effects on the principle external proteins of the virus, namely the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), where significant inhibition of HA was observed. In addition, the TC50 value, which is 50% reduction of the culture, was found to be 14.34 μl/ml (p &lt; 0.05) [
