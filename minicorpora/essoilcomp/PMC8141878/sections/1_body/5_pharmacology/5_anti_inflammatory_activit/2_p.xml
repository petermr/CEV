<p id="p0170">Though nitric oxide (NO) radicals act as intracellular messengers under normal conditions, their elevated numbers can bring up the cytotoxicity and inflammation issues. A study has evaluated the anti-inflammatory potential of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. aqueous extract. Significant scavenging of NO radicals with 80.3% of the activity at 16 μg/ml concentration was observed in accordance with the values obtained using dexamethasone (p &lt; 0.05) in murine macrophage cell line J774A.1 [

In case of inflammation, immune cells generally express the genes encoding for 5-lipoxygenease (5-LOX) production, which in turn activates the synthesis of leukotrienes. Tsai et al. (2011) targeted the inhibition of 5-LOX, showing an inhibition at 0.005 μg/ml (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of thyme oil concentration. This was more effective than α-bisabolol (0.049 μg/ml). They also assessed the effect of essential oil on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TNF-α, interleukins IL-1β, and IL-8 secretions using THP-1 cells at 0.01 μg/ml [
