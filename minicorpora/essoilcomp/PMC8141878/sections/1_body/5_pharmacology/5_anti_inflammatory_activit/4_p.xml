However, a few notable parameters like cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), cholestasis, vascular lesions, c-reactive protein (CRP) in chronic hepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, drug-induced autoimmunity could be assessed, which can support the antioxidant potential. In addition, autoimmune models like rheumatoid arthritis could be focused to assess the effect of
