<p id="p0175">In an 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study, Abdelli et al. (2017) analysed thyme oil in a dose dependent manner (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) against mice with carrageenan-induced paw edema to determine the anti-inflammatory activity. Paw thickness was found reducing at a dose of 400 mg/kg. Results were in accordance with both the controls Tween 80 and diclofenac (p &lt; 0.001). The study also determined the toxic level of thyme oil (4500 mg/kg), where sedation was observed at 5000 mg/kg [

Similarly, in the carrageenan-induced pleurisy model thyme oil at 250, 500 and 750 mg/kg reduced inflammatory exudates as well as migrated leucocytes in ear edema. Individual assessments revealed that thymol (34.2%) and carvacrol (47.3%) are attributable for the anti-inflammatory activity (p &lt; 0.05). This study also reported the toxicity level of thyme oil as 4000 mg/kg, which stands in accordance with the findings of Abdelli et al. (2017) [
