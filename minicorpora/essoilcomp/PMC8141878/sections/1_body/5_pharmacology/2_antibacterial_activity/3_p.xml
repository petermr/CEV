<p id="p0130">Further, the essential oil from 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. was found to inhibit the growth of multi-drug resistant (MDR) variants of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. A significant inhibition was observed with a zone of 35–40 mm at 2.8–11.5 μg/ml for MDR variants, whereas cefotaxime showed MIC at 32 μg/ml concentration (p &lt; 0.05) [

 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. essential oil or thyme oil was also found to be effective against porcine respiratory bacteria. 
 <italic>Actinobacillu spleuropneumoniae, Streptococcus suis, Actinobacillus suis, Haemophilus parasuis, Pasteurella multocida,</italic> and 
 <italic>Bordetella bronchiseptica</italic> were tested with thyme oil and considerable MIC values were obtained, ranging from 0.039% to 0.078% at dilutions 0.01–1.25% v/v (p &lt; 0.05) [
