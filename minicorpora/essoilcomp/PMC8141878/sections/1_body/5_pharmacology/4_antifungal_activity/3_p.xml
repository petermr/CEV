<p id="p0160">Scalas et al. (2018) assessed the antifungal activity against 
 <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> where MIC and MFC were found to be in the range of 56–1.12 mg/ml, in accordance with the standards fluconazole (FLC), itraconazole (ITC), and voriconazole (VRC). But individual antifungal assay showed profound results with thymol (0.02–0.08 mg/ml) (p &lt; 0.05) [

 <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic>. Also, treatment with 10 μg/ml of thyme oil reduced production of aflatoxin by 97.0 and 56.4% through vapour and liquid phases, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). In addition to this, the study also reported the downregulation of a few genes related to fungal development including brlA, abaA, and wetA and genes related to aflatoxin biosynthesis -aflR, aflD, and aflK [
