<p id="p0155">Thyme essential oil was found to be effective against fungal species including 
 <italic>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</italic>, 
 <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>, 
 <italic>Phytophthora parasitica</italic>, 
 <italic>Pythium aphanidermatum</italic>, 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic>, 
 <italic>Alternaria brassicae</italic>, 
 <italic>Trichoderma aggressivum</italic> f.sp. 
 <italic>europaeum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Cladobotryum mycophilum</italic>. The sensitivity of these fungi were assessed with the radial growth inhibition assay, which revealed an inhibitory value ranging from 13.9 to 41.4 mm at 5% concentration and ED
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 9.3 to 18.0% for all the species tested (p &lt; 0.05) [
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Further, a group of 183 clinical isolates of 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and 76 isolates of 
 <italic>C. glabrata</italic> species were tested for sensitivity towards 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. extract. Both MIC and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) were found to be in the range of 0.04–22.9 mg/ml for all the isolates. In the time kill assay, thyme oil reduced the fungal growth in the initial hours (4–8). Interestingly, thyme oil inhibited the fungal growth supplemented with sorbitol, an osmoprotectant with a much lower MIC (0.08 mg/ml) (p &lt; 0.05) [
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In addition, an 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> assessment using thymol on 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> in a 
 <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> nematode model resulted in the complete inhibition of the fungus at 64 mg/l and 128 mg/ml, better than that of the standard antibiotics used (p &lt; 0.05). Thymol is also reported to enhance the expressions of pmk-1and sec-1 genes, thereby resulting in the enhancement of p38 MAPK signalling pathway, which exhibits signalling events to combat 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> [
