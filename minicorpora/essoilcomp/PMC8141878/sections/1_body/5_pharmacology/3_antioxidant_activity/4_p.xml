<p id="p0150">The antioxidant potential of the oil is proved to be higher than those of the aqueous and ethanolic extracts [
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. However, novel applications like silver and zinc nanoparticles could be used in place of pure extracts, as they possess lower amount of cytotoxicity. Usage of cell lines and animal models could provide a better insight to the studies, revealing the biochemical changes that could occur before and after the administration of the 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. fractions. It is noteworthy that the antioxidant enzymes have been focused rather than the conventional assays like DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP [
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. However, it is advisable that these enzymatic analyses could be carried out using human cell lines with correlation in terms of its toxicity based on dose-dependent studies. In addition, studies have proved that different 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. extracts could alone be able to reduce the oxidative stress levels using the conventional antioxidant assays. But there are no available controls to compare its efficacy [
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In addition, the treatment with aqueous 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. extract alone has proved its potential to prevent or reverse the drug-induced toxic biochemical changes to normal via its antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. As a key finding, studies have revealed that an array of bioactive compounds showing antioxidant activities are also present in leaves and other parts of the plant, other than the oil alone [
