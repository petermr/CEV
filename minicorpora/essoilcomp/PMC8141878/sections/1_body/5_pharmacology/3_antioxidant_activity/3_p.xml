<p id="p0145">In case of thyme oil, DPPH, Ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), Ferrous ion-chelating ability assay (FIC), and 2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) radical cation scavenging activities were reported with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values 12.69, 13.29, and 6.46 mg/ml, respectively (p &lt; 0.05) [

El-Guendouz et al. (2019) demonstrated the ability of the ethanolic extract obtained using the oil extraction by-product of

 <sub>50</sub> of 93 μg/ml, similar to that of BHT (89 μg/ml). But these values were found to be of lower activity compared with that of the pure aqueous and ethanol extracts [
