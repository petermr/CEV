<p id="p0195">It was noteworthy to find that thyme oil and extracts show a notable cytotoxic effect on tumour cells, but not on normal human cells. A study conducted by Deb et al. (2011) showed the effect of thymol on HL-60 acute promyelotic leukemia cells. Thymol showed no cytotoxic effect on human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) at 5 and 25μM concentrations. However, extensive cytotoxicity was observed at &gt;50 μM, after 24 h [

(2018) employed a different approach, where both the plant extract and synthesized silver nanoparticles from the plant extract were evaluated against T47D human breast cancer cells. T47D cells showed a high sensitivity towards nanoparticles (90%) when compared with that of the extract (75%). T47D cells treated with nanoparticles showed 18.40% early and 0.69% late apoptosis with a varying IC
 <sub>50</sub> concentrations (12.5–100 μg/ml) (p &lt; 0.05), whereas in case of plant extract, 15.67% early and 1.70% late apoptosis was observed [
