<p id="p0245">Aging, a condition characterized by a reduced bone density, can be treated by increasing calcium uptake in the body. Elbahnasawy et al. (2019) conducted a study depicting the effect of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. powder on rats with low calcium intake. The study resulted in a significant increase in the bone mass (2.93 g/kg), length 32.8 mm), and density (0.13 g/cm
 <sup>2</sup>), compared with that of the low calcium diet control (2.46 g/kg, 32.2 mm, and 0.09 g/cm
 <sup>2</sup>, respectively) (p &lt; 0.05). This study proved the potential of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L.in the treatment of osteoporosis and other bone related diseases [

 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. is also effective on dental caries and proved its efficacy over the formed ocresolpulpotomy, due to profound antibacterial properties. 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. ethanolic extract along with zinc oxide was used in patients with dental caries. Clinical and radiographic evaluations showed 94.4% and 88.2% improvement, respectively with no statistical significance compared to that of the standard drug formocresol 88.2% (p &gt; 0.05) [
