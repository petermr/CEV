<p id="p0240">Cholinergic affliction is found in Alzheimer's disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder involving the death of cholinergic neurons. Administration of thyme oil to

Enhancement of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor activity is also observed because of the upregulation of unc-17, unc-50, and cho-1 and genes at 40 and 60 parts per million (ppm). p-cymene, a monoterpene present in thyme extract, was attributed for the gene upregulation activity along with a corresponding downregulation of ace-1 and ace-2 at 20 and 100 ppm (p &lt; 0.05). Interestingly, thymol and γ-terpinene enhanced synaptic acetylcholine levels in combination (40 ppm) but failed to do the so when administered individually [
