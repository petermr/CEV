 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. shows aneuploidy where the number of chromosomes varies in different plants of the same species. Among these, 2n = 28, 30, 56 and 60 are said to be the most frequent numbers for other plants belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Thymus</italic>. Aneuploidy has played an important role during evolution and is responsible for varying numbers. This is true for 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. with 2n = 28, 58 [
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Thus, it becomes evident that the plant has a diverse genetic constitution. This may also contribute to its morphological variation. However, there are not available data on the restriction of these genetically diverse species to a specific region or country. Several sub-species are present that further add to the complexities of genetic research. In addition, several chemotypes or chemovars of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. exist. As the phytochemical profile of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. depicts the presence of extensive amount of essential oil components, chemotypes vary based on the composition of the same [

Recently, a study identified 6 different chemotypes namely linalool, borneol, geraniol, sabinene hydrate, thymol, and carvacrol [

 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. More research needs to be conducted in terms of chemotypes to identify the potent chemicals that can be used to target diseases at a molecular level. Based on the chemical profile and mode of employment of these chemotypes against specific diseases, significant results can be expected in phytotherapy.
