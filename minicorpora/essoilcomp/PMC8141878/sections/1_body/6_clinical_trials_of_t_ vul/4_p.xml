<p id="p0265">The use of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. in the treatment of respiratory ailments [
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], was supported by a clinical trial investigating a combination of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> and 
 <italic>Primula vulgaris</italic> (primrose, common thyme) dry powder extract on bronchitis patients. The combination (oral dose of 160 mg thyme and 60 mg primrose root extract for 11 days) reduced the cough symptoms on day 9 with an efficacy of 73.7% in comparison with that of the placebo (day 11; 57.8%) (p &lt; 0.0001). Reduction of bronchitis severity score was observed only after 4 days in case of thyme and primrose treatment group (-6.2) in comparison with the placebo (-4.1) (p &lt; 0.05). Extract was well tolerated in most of the patients (183) with only 1.7% adverse effects reported with 97.8 % patients rating this combination as preferable. The extract also reduced minor symptoms like disturbance in sleep, rising body temperature, chest pain, and difficulty in breathing [

Therefore, understanding the mode of action along with product formulation with lesser adverse effect and affordability are to be focused. Research also needs to be focused on revealing the chemical components of such herbal products made.
