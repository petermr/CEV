<p id="p0255">Despite many explorations in the aspects of pharmacological efficiency, very little data are available on the clinical trials of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L.-based products. Our literature survey could find only few studies evaluating the pharmacological potential of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L.-based products using humans as study models [
 <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. These clinical trials used different forms of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> extracts and have resulted in the amelioration of the patients'/volunteers' health conditions (
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Chemical characterization of these herbal products is yet to be done, which could decipher the specific action of phytochemicals involved in the pharmacological activity. Recently, a study by Caverzan et al. (2020) prepared a gel named ThymLec gel 2%, which was used as a phytocosmetic to improve facial health conditions [
 <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. A preparation from leaf and flower extract (1.0%–3.0%) + water, propanediol, glycerine +5.0%–13.4%) lecithin (additive) + benzyl alcohol, potassium sorbate, tocopherol (preservatives), application of this gel2 mg/cm
 <sup>2</sup> on female facial skin with 2% concentration (20 mg/g w/w) twice a day (morning and evening) resulted in the reduction of area (7.0%), depth, and length (10.2%) of the perioral wrinkles on day 60, whereas the benchmark produced a reduction of 5.4% and 7.5% of the same parameters, respectively. The length of the nasolabial lines was also decreased (8.9%). Similarly, area (8.9%), breadth (3.9%), and length (11.1%) of the crow's feet wrinkles were decreased with a corresponding reduction in the smile lines by 6.9%, 4.1%, and 10.1%, respectively. Face oval remodelling evaluation using ThymLec 2% resulted in the reduction of total face volume (4.9 fold) in comparison with benchmark on day 60. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> adiponectin synthesis was significantly increased in cultured 3T3-L1 embryonic fibroblasts treated with ThymLec 2% (122% at 0.0195% concentration) and (137% at 0.039% concentration). This was 87% higher than the benchmark used. A dose-dependent treatment of ThymLec 2% resulted in the expression of PPAR-γ mRNA levels, in comparison with that of the control groups. ThymLec topical application led to adipogenesis and lipid production, further augmenting cell volume and better remodelling of face oval features. ThymLec modulates the PPAR-γ signalling pathway, increasing adiponectin production and adipocyte lipid accumulation [79.
