<p id="p0030">Authors searched different databases using keywords to end up with a mammoth literature that included research articles, review articles, book chapters, and books. The literature was divided into different sections based on the title and abstract available along with the removal of non-relevant information and duplicates. Later, a second screening was carried out, where studies with unique methodology covering maximum research aspects were retained. Further, a few of the review articles with limited amount of information were removed. During the drafting of the review, a few research articles were removed to retain the articles with unique methodology and significant results. However, it was inevitable to retain a few of the articles despite their insignificant results and older methodology, due to lack of relevant and advanced information. From 2791 identified studies, a total of 118 studies were retained on completion of the different levels of screening. The outline was planned to meet up the PRISMA regulations (
