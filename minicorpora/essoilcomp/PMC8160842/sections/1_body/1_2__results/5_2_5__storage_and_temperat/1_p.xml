<p>The essential oil mixtures were stored at three different temperatures (15, 25, and 35 °C) for one, two, and three months, and all mixtures were introduced to FTIR analysis to determine functional group changes during the storage period. The functional groups present in the mixtures of essential oils were determined by comparing the vibration frequencies in the wave number.

 <sup>-1</sup>. The FTIR spectrum of BE showed strong broadband at 2922 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and was assigned to the Alkanes C-H stretch, a medium band intensity vibration at 1644 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> was assigned to NH
 <sub>2</sub>, the strong methylene/methyl band at 1464.95 and 1446.16 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The peaks of IR at 2931 and 2842 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> were due to Alkyl C-H asymmetric and symmetric stretching. The strong bands at 1631 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 1633 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> were indicative of aromatic compound C-H bending, at 1306–1361 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> represented phenol compound –O-H and C-H stretch bands, while the number wave at 1015–1270 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> showed the strong band of C-O. The position of the Alkenyl C=C stretching regularity varied slightly as a function of location around the double bond. Carbonyl compounds were often the strongest bands in the spectrum and were located between 1825 and 1575 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. For a double bond, the function group played an important role in the observation of the carbonyl group. This included a connection of an aromatic group to a C=C or C=O. The wave number at 985 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> indicated a strong or medium band for alkene compound C=C-H and at 920.1 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> represented group C-H. For other oils no change in stretching and bending vibrations for C-H, C-O, C=C and O-H bonds were observed with respect to temperature and storage time.
