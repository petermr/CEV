 <xref rid="molecules-26-03055-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) of black pepper (B), eucalyptus (E), rosemary (R), and tea tree (T) essential oils indicated that there are many major constituents in all the types of essential oils (pure and mixture): black pepper contained α-Pinene 12.66%, Sabinene 8.6%, β-Pinene 12.17%, 1R-α-Pinene 5.56%, D-Limonene 15.52%, Eucalyptol 3.21%, and Caryophyllene 24.56%, which were the most abundant compounds. The percentages of compounds in eucalyptus oil were P-Cymene 4.82%, 
 <sc>D</sc>-Limonene 5.72%, and Eucalyptol 82.25%; whereas the main compounds in rosemary oil were α-Pinene 15.87%, Camphene 3.89%, β-Pinene 8.5%, P-Cymene 2.73%, D-Limonene 3.37%, Eucalyptol 35.27%, (−)-Camphor 10.43%, and Caryophyllene 4.92%. The proportions of tea tree chemical composition were (+)-4-Carene 7.31%, P-Cymene 3.8%, Eucalyptol 4.98%, γ-Terpinene 17.74%, Terpinolene 2.78%, (−)-Terpinen-4-ol 43.94%, and α-Terpineol 3.61%. However, the most abundant compounds in six types of essential oil combinations (black pepper + eucalyptus (BE), black pepper + rosemary (BR), black pepper + tea tree (BT), eucalyptus + rosemary (ER), eucalyptus + tea tree (ET), and tea tree + rosemary (TR)) were α-Pinene 6.76, 14.60, 7.95, 8.28, 1.59, and 9.28% found in BE, BR, BT, ER, ET, and TR, respectively. Camphene 0.23, 2.32, 0.25, 1.97, and 2.00% for BE, BR, BT, ER, and TR, respectively, with 1R- α-Pinene 2.62, 2.60, 2.85% found in BE, BR, and BT, respectively. Furthermore, (+)-4-Carene 3.51, 3.55, and 3.96% were found in BT, ET, and TR, while Sabinene 4.22, 4.27, and 4.58% were found in BE, BR, and BT, respectively. β-Pinene 6.12, 10.43, 6.75, 4.35, and 4.6% in BE, BR, BT, ER, and TR, respectively; whereas, P-Cymene 3.07, 1.94, 2.45, 3.81, 4.45, and 3.34%, and also D-Limonene 10.58, 9.34, 8.80, 4.56, 3.60, and 3.34% were found in all combination types. In addition, Eucalyptol 44.58, 19.63, 4.16, 59.45, 46.31, and 20.56% originated in six mixtures, and γ-Terpinene 8.50, 9.5, and 9.38% in BT, ET, and TR. The proportions of (−)-Terpinen-4-ol were 20.85, 20.94, and 22.02% in BT, ET, and TR, and the percentages of Caryophyllene in all combinations were 11.50, 14.62, 13.10, 2.36 and 2.73% for BE, BR, BT, ER, and TR, respectively.
