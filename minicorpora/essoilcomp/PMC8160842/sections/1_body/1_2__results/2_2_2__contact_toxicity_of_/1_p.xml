<p>When essential oils were evaluated for their insecticidal activities using the contact bioassay method (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03055-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), all black pepper, eucalyptus, rosemary and tea tree essential oils showed the mortality against 
 <italic>M. persicae</italic>. The result indicated that black pepper oil exerted contact toxicity against GPA in a time and dose-dependent manner, and the dose 5% resulted in the highest mortality of aphids, followed by the dose 3% then 2% and 1%, compared with the untreated aphids at exposures of 1, 3, 6, 8 and 24 h. The highest mortality of 80% was observed for both black pepper and tea tree essential oil at 24 h exposure time; however, mortality at the concentrations of 1, 2 and 3 was low. Conversely, eucalyptus and rosemary were less effective on the target pest compared with black pepper and tea tree oils. The mortality with eucalyptus oil was 5, 8.33, 16.67, 33.33, and 53.33% at the concentration of 5% at 1, 3, 6, 8, and 24 h exposure times, and mortality from the rosemary oil at the dose 5% was 8.33, 8.33 (for 1 and 3 h), 23.33, 35, and 60%, respectively, at the same exposure time and R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.801 (Adjusted R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.795).
