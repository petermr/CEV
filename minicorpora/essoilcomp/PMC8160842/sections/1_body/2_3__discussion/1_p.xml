<p>Plant essential oils are potentially valuable for GPA control. They performed in many ways on several types of insects and can be applied to crops or stored products [

 <italic>M. persicae</italic>. The insecticidal activity against GPA was observed with 1, 2, 3, and 5%. These essential oils might be important applicants for natural GPA control agents. All essential oils applied by contact proved toxic to 
 <italic>M. persicae</italic>, although they differed in their efficacy. The two binary essential oil combinations resulted in higher mortality than the effect of a single essential oil. Synergistic combinations led to enhanced toxicity of the essential oil mixture and appeared to have multiple modes of action in pests compared with the use of a single essential oil, as shown in Tak et al.
