<p>The GC-MS analysis (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03055-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) showed that differences in chemical composition and its percentages were tested between essential oils in the pure and mixed oils. Black pepper GC-MS analysis showed that Caryophyllene was the most abundant major constituent followed by D-Limonene, α-Pinene, β-Pinene, and Sabinene. All these constituents affected various pests, and these results were consistent with [

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-03055" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The results indicated that Eucalyptol was one of the major chemical compositions in the eucalyptus essential oil, which made up (82.25%) of the total chemical composition of the oil. Eucalyptol has insecticidal activities against many insects, as shown in many previous studies [

 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-03055" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition, the main constituents in rosemary essential oil were Eucalyptol, α-Pinene, (−)-Camphor, and β-Pinene. These components exhibit pesticide action that is used in pest control, as presented in many past experiments [

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-03055" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Moreover, the result showed that tea tree essential oil contained the highest compounds, which are (–)-Terpinen-4-ol and γ-Terpinene. These two major constituents have insecticidal properties and affect insect enzymes such as AChE, GST, and CarE [

 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-03055" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, the proportions of the main compounds in all types of tested essential oils changed after binary mixing. Chemical compositions in the BE combination were Caryophyllene, D-Limonene, α-Pinene, β-Pinene, and Sabinene. The result of GC-MS indicated variations of chemical compound percentages between the two pure essential oils as compared to their mixtures. In the BE mixture, the main constitutions were reduced to nearly half, compared with black pepper and eucalyptus separately (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03055-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The BE combination also showed most of the compounds found in the mixture that were not found in the pure oils, and this might have enhanced the range of insecticidal activity between oil constituents. Whereas in the BR combination, the highest compound amounts were α-Pinene, β-Pinene, D-Limonene, Eucalyptol, and Caryophyllene; these amounts were decreased compared with their purity before mixing. In BT, the result indicated that (–)-Terpinen-4-ol and Caryophyllene were the highest constituents in the mixture, this finding was consistent with [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-03055" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], which indicated the high amounts of Terpinen-4-ol and Caryophyllene in tea tree 
 <italic>M. alternifolia</italic> oil. In our study tea tree oil and binary mixtures that included tea tree oil (BT, ET, and TR) showed maximum efficacy against GPA, and this can be attributed to Terpinen-4-ol as the major constituent in all the above four oils. Moreover, ER, ET, and TR had the same components: α-Pinene (8.28, 1.59, and 9.28%, respectively), Eucalyptol (59.45, 46.31, and 20.56%, respectively), γ-Terpinene (1.36, 9.50, and 9.38, respectively) and (−)-Camphor (5.10, 0, and 5.32%). All these compounds have properties against various types of insects, as shown in previous studies [
