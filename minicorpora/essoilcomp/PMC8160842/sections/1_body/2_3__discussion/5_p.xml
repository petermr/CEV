<p>The findings of our study indicated that the three tested temperatures had no effect on essential oil stability based on FTIR analysis, as no changes in functional groups could be seen in all periods of storage. Our results were consistent with Turek and Stintzing [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-03055" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], who demonstrated oil stability at various temperatures (5–38 °C), and that it showed no effect from temperature for three months when stored. All these peaks of function groups were not affected by the storage temperature tested on the essential oils or the time of storage, and all groups remained at the same wavenumber location. FTIR analysis was performed because is a fast and relatively cheap technique that might allow direct function group measurements of components in mixtures.
