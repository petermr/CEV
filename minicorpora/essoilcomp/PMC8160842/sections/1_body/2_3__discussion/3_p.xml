<p>The results of this study showed the insecticidal effects of black pepper, eucalyptus, rosemary, and tea tree essential oils and their binary combinations (BE, BR, BT, ER, ET, and TR) in various concentrations on the GPA. However, there were differences in the bio-insecticidal effects of 10 essential oils (four pure and six binary combination oils), despite them all having significant aphicidal activity on 
 <italic>M. persicae</italic> in various mortality percentages based on the concentrations of essential oils, especially with high test doses for 24 h exposure time. The efficacy of essential oils depends upon their chemical composition and the proportion of each constituent present in the mixture. The essential oil constituents vary from one type to another, depending on plant species [

 <xref rid="B31-molecules-26-03055" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and Liška et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-26-03055" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] reported that α-Pinene, D-Limonene, and Camphene, which were major constituents, demonstrated aphicidal properties against the wooly beech aphid 
 <italic>Phyllaphis fagi</italic> and the palm aphid 
 <italic>Cerataphis brasiliensis</italic>. Conversely, previous studies showed that limonene is able to attract aphids’ natural enemies, so essential oil containing a high amount of D-Limonene can act as an attractant for parasitoids and predators [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-26-03055" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], while the compounds Eugenol and 1,8-Cineole have been reported effective against many insects, including aphids [

 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-03055" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Other major constituents, such as Terpinene-4-ol, Terpinene, 4-Carene, and α-Phellandrene also have an insecticidal effect against several insects, and these compounds were found in the tested essential oils (black pepper, eucalyptus, rosemary, and tea tree) [

 <xref rid="B35-molecules-26-03055" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Some previous work related to the aphicidal effects of rosemary oil were consistent with our findings. Rosemary oil has insecticidal effects against several insects and is used in many commercial products as an insecticide [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-03055" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A study conducted by Digilio et al. [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-26-03055" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] found that rosemary is a repellent and contact toxin against 
 <italic>M. persicae</italic> and has a greater ability to penetrate through the cuticle of aphids than to be absorbed from the gut and intestines. These findings are similar to the results presented by Tomova et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-26-03055" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], indicating an increase in the mortality percentage of aphids when exposed to diverse essential oils; Görür et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-03055" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] confirmed the significant effects of the essential oil volatiles against three species of aphids, demonstrating a potential for aphid control. Black pepper and tea tree essential oil contact application resulted in 80% mortality in the GPA; there is a report of comparable findings with results of nearly 100% mortality caused by black pepper and tea tree essential oils against the rose-grain aphid [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-03055" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In addition, our findings indicated that the mortality rates caused by eucalyptus and rosemary oils were 94.44 and 95.56%, respectively (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03055-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03055-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). However, the combination of TR, ET, and BT essential oils can cause 98.33, 95.00, and 98.33% mortality, respectively, while contact application showed that the parallel effect of essential oils against cabbage aphids resulted in more than 85% mortality [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-03055" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Conversely, it was concluded that there was an impact on the aphid population on the plant when exposed to a low dose [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-03055" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Our findings on the insecticidal effects of the tested combined essential oils showed high mortality rates caused by TR, ET, and BT, and more than 96% mortality for BR, BT, and ET. In the series of concentrations applied, mortality was concentration-dependent. The reason for these results was the essential oils’ constituents and their volatiles. Our result was consistent with [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-26-03055" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], who showed high mortality rates in 
 <italic>M. persicae</italic> and 
 <italic>Acyrthosiphon pisum</italic> by using different doses of various essential oils (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03055-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03055-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Regarding the use of these oils, it can be concluded that black pepper and tea tree have stronger insecticidal potential than eucalyptus and rosemary.
