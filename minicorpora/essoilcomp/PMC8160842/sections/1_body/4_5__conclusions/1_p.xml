<p>In conclusion, the current study demonstrates the strong toxic effects against aphids using the essential oils of black pepper, eucalyptus, rosemary, and tea tree, and their binary combinations. They were found to have effective insecticidal properties in contact toxicity on GPA. The contact treatment of pure essential oil indicated that black pepper and tea tree essential oils were more effective than eucalyptus and rosemary essential oils on aphids at a high concentration after 24 h. Essential oils are natural plant products containing a complex mixture of compounds and thus have multiple insecticidal or aphicidal properties. The essential oil mixtures showed their insecticidal effects on aphids and the interaction between the binary oils led to synergistic, additive effects. There was a synergistic effect between black pepper and tea tree, eucalyptus and tea tree, and rosemary and tea tree essential oils, while the other combinations of black pepper and eucalyptus, black pepper and rosemary, and eucalyptus and rosemary showed additive interactions. According to the FTIR analysis, essential oil combinations were stable between 15–35 °C without affecting the properties of the oils. Therefore, we suggest that tested essential oil constituents in a pure state and in combinations should be screened as potential natural insecticides or be included in the chemical synthesis of a new type of pesticide, based on essential oils and their constituents.</p>
