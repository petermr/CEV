<p>The FTIR spectrum of the mixture of essential oils was performed on a Perkin Elmer Spectrum Version 10.4.2 model Frontier FTIR/NIR in the School of Engineering and Information Technology, Murdoch University. Functional groups were determined with the help of IR correlation charts. IR spectra were shown in the percentage of absorbance and the wave number region for FTIR analysis from 4000–400 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The FTIR software (version 2.3.1.5) and the OMNIC window with ATR cell were used for the analysis of the states of chemical bonding. The number of scans and their resolution were four with a resolution of 4 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, and the detector MIR TGS (Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) was used. Beamsplitter OptKBr, Apodization strong, spectrum type spectrum, beam type ratio, phase correction magnitude, scan speed 0.2, IGram type Double, scan direction Combine JStop 8.94, IR-Laser Wavenumber 15798.00, Description DATR 1 bounce Diamond/KRS5.
