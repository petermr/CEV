<p>This study was carried out to evaluate the insecticidal activities of essential oils against GPA 
 <italic>M. persicae</italic> by studying contact toxicity and the synergistic activities of black pepper, tea tree, blue eucalyptus and rosemary essential oils because some pesticides are losing their effectiveness as a result of pest resistance. In addition, it evaluates a synergistic interaction between binary mixtures of essential oils against 
 <italic>M. persicae</italic> in different methods of application. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis was done to check the stability of essential oil mixtures during storage at different temperatures.
