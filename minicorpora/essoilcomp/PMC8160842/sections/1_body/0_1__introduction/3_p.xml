<p>Black pepper 
 <italic>Piper nigrum</italic> L. extracts showed insecticidal activities because they contain isobutyl amides that are toxic to insects. As reported in previous studies, piper extracts are a unique and valuable source of biopesticide [

 <xref rid="B12-molecules-26-03055" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], suitable for controlling small insects and reducing the development of pest resistance when mixed as a synergist with other botanical pesticides such as pyrethrum. It has been shown that black pepper essential oil reduces the adult emergence of cowpea weevil 
 <italic>Callosobruchus maculatus</italic> by 100% after 30 days of treatment [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-03055" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Furthermore, rosemary 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> essential oil has been used conventionally as a medication in many countries because it is non-toxic to humans and environments [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-03055" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Moreover, it was reported that the effect of 1% rosemary oil on two-spotted mites 
 <italic>Tetranychus urticae</italic> for contact toxicity on tomato caused high mortality after using the tomato leaf disc test for 12 and 48 h [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-03055" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Rosemary essential oil was commercialized as a pesticide for its efficacy against several insect and mite pests; chemical compositions of rosemary oil have shown the LD
 <sub>50</sub> values of the oil ranged from 58.9–335.9 μg/larva when applied to cabbage loopers 
 <italic>Trichoplusia ni,</italic> and the LD

Moreover, eucalyptus essential oil possesses a wide range of pesticide properties including insecticidal, insect repellent, herbicidal, acaricidal, fungicidal, and anti-microbial, and is considered non-polluting and environmentally friendly with little or no toxicological effect [

 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-03055" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Eucalyptus essential oil has insecticidal properties in various forms such as contact, antifeeding, oviposition inhibition, repellence, and fumigant. Eucalyptus leaf extract is effective against aphids by the contact test method and antifeeding; it is effective against cotton leafhopper and cotton stainer by inhibiting oviposition. The fumigant of eucalyptus oil works against houseflies; and the oil and dry powder extract are used to protect potatoes against potato tuber moth [

 <italic>Melaleuca alternifolia</italic> essential oil has been used as insect control agents because it contains bioactive chemicals that are toxic to several insect species, and researchers [
