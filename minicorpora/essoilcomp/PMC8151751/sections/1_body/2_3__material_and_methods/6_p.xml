<p>The agar well diffusion method in Mueller-Hinton agar plates was used for antimicrobial testing of essential oils. Incubation of inoculated bacteria was conducted for 12 h at a temperature of 37 °C, in Nutrient broth. A Mueller-Hinton agar plate was cultured with standardized microbial culture broth. Essential oils in concentrations of 50 mg/mL were prepared in organosulfur solvent ((CH
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>SO). Four wells of 8 mm were bored in the inoculated media. Each well was filled with 50 μL of essential oils: positive control of amikacin (30 mcg) and nitrofurantoin (300 mcg) and negative control. The diffusion process lasted for about 30 min at a temperature of 22.5 °C and incubation time for 18–24 h at 37 °C. Following incubation, plates were examined to develop a clear zone around the well which corresponded to the antimicrobial activity. The zone of inhibition was detected and assessed (mm).
