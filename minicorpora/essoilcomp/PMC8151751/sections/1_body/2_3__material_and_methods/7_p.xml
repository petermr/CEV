<p>The broth microdilution method was used to establish the minimal inhibitory concentrations corresponding to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Twin successive dilutions of essential oils were conducted directly in a microtiter plate containing Mueller-Hinton broth. The bacterial inoculum was added to 5 × 105 CFU/mL in each well. An antibiotic amikacin was used for the control reference. Incubation of plates was performed at temperature of 37 °C for 24 h. Resazurin was added to each well of the microtiter plate and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The occurrence of pink color was associated with wells which displayed bacterial growth, while the blue color was associated with those without bacterial growth. The minimal inhibitory concentrations were considered as the lowest concentration of the essential oil that completely inhibits bacterial growth.</p>
