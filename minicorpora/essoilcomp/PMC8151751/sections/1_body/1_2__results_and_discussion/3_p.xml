<p>The two most popular essential oils on the market are tea tree and lavender oil [

 <xref rid="B34-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] investigated the adulteration of essential oils, which showed that six store brand essential oils, tea tree, lavender, sandalwood, rose, eucalyptus, and lemongrass, contained carbitol in concentrations from 23% to 35%, and four of the six oils contained diethyl phthalate in concentrations ranging from 0.33% to 16%. These toxicants are particularly concerning because they are known inhalation hazards, and the intended usage of these oils is for aromatherapy [
 <xref rid="B34-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Based on our results and the high concentration of carbitol (13.05%) in lavender essential oil, we can assume that our lavender essential oil was not natural, which was revealed by the high concentration of carbitol as the contaminant and should be pointed out as a possible threat. Alpha-pinene presents a polyphenolic terpene organic compound [

It has been reported that α-pinene is a strong antioxidant agent which inhibits prostaglandin E1 and NF-κB and thus contributes to its anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic effects. Terpene is a part of many medical, aromatic, and spice plants [

 <xref rid="B38-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. It has the highest boiling point of the four known terpnine isomers (α-terpinine, β-terpinene, and δ-terpinine). It is a major component of various essential oils and has strong antioxidant activity [

 <xref rid="B40-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. It has a lemon-like or lime-like odor that is most commonly used in the food, aroma, soap, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, tobacco, clothing and perfume industries.
