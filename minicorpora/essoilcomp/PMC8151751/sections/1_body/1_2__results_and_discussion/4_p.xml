<p>Many experiments have shown the positive influence of these bioactive compounds found in essential oils, which was the topic of our research. Hendel et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] in their research analyzed essential oils from the aerial parts of 15 samples of Algerian rosemary. The GC-MSD, as in our study, for the determination of phenolic compound was used. Thirty-eight components were characterized, with the highest share of α-pinene, camphene, and limonene as the main components; camphor, 1,8-cineole, and borneol as the principal oxygenated substances; caryophyllene, α-bisabolol, and humulene as the most represented sesquiterpenes. Furthermore, Hendel et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] evaluated essential oils for their antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and against ten fungal strains belonging to Aspergillus 
 <italic>Alternaria</italic>, 
 <italic>Candida</italic>, 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic>, 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic>, and 
 <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> species, where the results showed moderate antimicrobial activity. Our results showed that eucalyptus essential oil is richest in eucalyptol (1,8-cineole), (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00546-f001">Figure 1</xref>), while significant concentrations of α-pinene (12.60%), 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (3.24%), limonene (3.87%), and γ-terpinene (7.37%) were reordered, respectively (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00546-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Eucalyptus essential oil, as well as rosemary, poses numerous beneficial properties. For example, phenolic compounds, such as camphene, α-pinene, and 2-phenyl ethanol, have high insecticidal properties of eucalyptus essential oil, so they present a potential candidate for application in integrated pest management approaches [

 <xref rid="B33-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] confirmed the fumigant and repellent action of eucalyptus essential oil against 
 <italic>Hypothenemus hampei</italic>. The toxic effect of eucalyptus essential oil on the coffee berry borer is due to a synergistic effect involving 1,8-cineole, α-pinene, and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, according to investigations of Reyes et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Results of our study showed that the essential oil of lavender was rich in linalool (10.71%), linalool acetate (9.60%), and α-terpinyl acetate (10.93%) bioactive compounds, respectively. Additionally, we found a significant concentration of carbitol (13.05%) in investigated lavender essential oil, which is a particular indication of essential oil adulteration. Our assumptions have also been confirmed by another study [
 <xref rid="B34-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In addition to the bioactive compounds that we isolated from lavender essential oil in our research, Yadikar et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] reported results that indicate isolations of seven new bioactive compounds from lavender. The same authors reported that they isolated lavandunat, lavandufurandiol, lavandufluoren, lavandupyrones A and B, and lavandudiphenyls A and B, along with five known compounds, benzoic acid, methyl propanoate, rosmarinic acid, and isosalvianolic acid C, from the ethyl acetate extract of the remaining material, which was obtained from lavender essential oil. According to the research of Sen et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], in addition to the aforementioned essential oils, stated that the most produced peppermint essential oil in the Indian market also often has a high concentration of carbitol, which indicates adulteration. We also come to the same conclusion regarding the usage of lavender essential oil in our study. Donadu et al. [
 <xref rid="B46-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] investigated the in vitro activity of lavender essential oil against drug-resistant strains of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Bearing in mind that lavender essential oil has been used for its anti-inflammatory, antidepressant, antiseptic, antifungal, and antimicrobial properties, the positive result in this research was expected. Donadu et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] showed that lavender essential oil did not possess a cytotoxic effect when administered in very low concentration, while the same essential oil significantly reduced nitric oxide synthase activity on murine macrophages, which was also evaluated. Increased drug resistance and the absence of new antibiotics can promote the production of natural antimicrobial replacements, which is in agreement with numerous investigations of Puvača et al. [
 <xref rid="B47-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00546-f002">Figure 2</xref> presents the peaks of chromatography analysis of the essential oils of tea tree (a), rosemary (b), eucalyptus (c), and lavender (d) used in this research.
