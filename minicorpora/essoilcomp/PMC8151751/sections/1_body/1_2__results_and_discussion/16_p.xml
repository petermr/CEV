<p>Elaissi et al. [
 <xref rid="B62-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] investigated the antibacterial activity of several 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> species and their correlation with chemical composition. The main chemical compounds were determined to be 1,8-cineole, spathulenol, 
 <italic>Î±</italic>-pinene, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, and limonene. The most potent antibacterial activity was recorded against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, while the correlation between the levels of active compounds in essential oil and the antibacterial activities was noticed. Similar results, which are in accordance with our findings, were demonstrated in the study of Vaghasiya and Chanda [
 <xref rid="B63-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Authors investigated the antimicrobial and antifungal properties of eucalyptus essential oil and concluded that the most susceptible bacterium was 
 <italic>Citrobacter freundii</italic>, while the most resistant was 
 <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic>.
