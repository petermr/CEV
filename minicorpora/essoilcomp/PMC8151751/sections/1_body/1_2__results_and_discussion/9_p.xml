<p>The antimicrobial efficiency of essential oils was determined by measuring the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), as shown in 
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00546-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Among the tested essential oils in our study, tea tree was discovered to demonstrate strong antimicrobial activity. The recorded MIC of 
 <italic>S. Typhi</italic> was 6.2 mg/mL, 3.4 mg/mL of 
 <italic>C. koseri</italic>, 3.1 mg/mL of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, and 2.7 mg/mL of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922, compared to tea tree. Similarly, only 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 25923 showed antimicrobial activity towards rosemary (1.4 mg/mL), eucalyptus (2.9 mg/mL), and lavender (2.1 mg/mL).
