In addition to the main bioactive compounds, the results of our research showed that the essential oil of tea tree is rich in α-pinene (18.38%), limonene (7.55%), and γ-terpinene (14.01%), respectively. Obtained results showed that rosemary essential oil was rich in α-pinene (8.38%) and limonene (11.86%); eucalyptus was rich in α-pinene (12.60%),
