<p>Unfortunately, the antimicrobial properties of eucalyptus essential oil are very limited, but lavender essential oil and its effects in various fields have been investigated. Adaszyńska-Skwirzyńska and Szczerbińska [
 <xref rid="B64-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] investigated the antimicrobial activity of lavender essential oil and its influence on the production performance of broiler chickens. Researchers concluded that the addition of 0.4 mL/L to the drinking water of broiler chickens had significantly improved production results, with a proven significant effect on bacterial growth inhibition. Another study was performed to verify the antimicrobial activity of lavender essential oil as the component of a preservative system in oil in water body milk [

 <xref rid="B66-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] investigated the antimicrobial activity of sage, rosemary, eucalyptus, melissa, lavender, and thyme essential oils against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Based on their findings, it was concluded that the most active essential oils were eucalyptus and rosemary, with the MICs ranging from 0.097 to 0.390 mg/mL. The results of Shirugumbi Hanamanthagouda et al. [
