<p>The in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities of tea tree oil were investigated, and MICs for sixteen different microorganisms were determined by applying the broth dilution method. Tea tree oil showed the best overall antimicrobial effect [
 <xref rid="B59-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The antimicrobial activity of tea tree essential oil has been known for a long time. Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B52-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] investigated the dynamics and mechanism of its antimicrobial activities of tea tree essential oil in two bacterial strains. Poisoned food technique assessment showed that the MICs of tea tree essential oil for 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> were 1.08 and 2.17 mg/mL, respectively. Antimicrobial dynamic curves showed that with increasing concentrations of essential oil, the rate of cell killing and the duration of the growth lag phase increased correspondingly [

 <italic>E. coli</italic> and the Gram-positive bacterium 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> was investigated using various methods. It has been reported that the exposure of these organisms to minimum inhibitory concentrations of tea tree oil inhibit respiration and increase the permeability of bacterial cytoplasmic and yeast plasma membranes [
