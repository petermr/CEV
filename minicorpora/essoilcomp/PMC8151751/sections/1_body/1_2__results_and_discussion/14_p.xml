<p>The antimicrobial efficiency of essential oils was also determined by measuring the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC), which is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00546-f003">Figure 3</xref>. Results of the MBC show that tea tree demonstrated the strongest antimicrobial activity. The recorded MBC of 
 <italic>S. Typhi</italic> was 12.4 mg/mL, 6.8 mg/mL of 
 <italic>C. koseri</italic>, 6.2 mg/mL of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, and 5.4 mg/mL of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922, compared to tea tree. Exceptionally, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 25923 showed bactericidal activity towards rosemary of 2.8 mg/mL, eucalyptus of 5.8 mg/mL, and lavender of 4.1 mg/mL.
