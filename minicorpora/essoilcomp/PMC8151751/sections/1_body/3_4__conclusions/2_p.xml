<p>Our research showed tea tree essential oilâ€™s antimicrobial activity towards 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>S. Typhi</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. koseri</italic>, while the other essential oils exhibited their antimicrobial activity towards 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Although results showed some potential in the in vitro activity of investigated essential oils for pathogenic bacteria, these obtained results still may not be applied in vivo. Based on our in vitro findings, further research in in vivo conditions is necessary to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of investigated essential oils fully.
