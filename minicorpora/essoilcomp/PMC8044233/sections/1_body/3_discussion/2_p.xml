<p id="Par24">The essential oil was characterized by a higher percentage of terpene hydrocarbons, especially the monoterpenoids, which constituted 60 to 70% of the essential oil composition. The major terpene hydrocarbons found are α-pinene, myrcene, β-caryophyllene, 1-Pentadecene, and germacrene D. The percentages of these terpene hydrocarbons were higher in flower head than leave and root at both NO

 <sup>+</sup> ratios. The most abundant terpene found in the essential oil was germacrene D, which showed a remarkable rise from 1.5% in root to 51% in flower head and 0.95% in root to 47% in flower head at 90:10 and 70:30 NO
