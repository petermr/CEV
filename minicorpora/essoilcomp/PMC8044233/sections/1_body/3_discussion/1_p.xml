<p id="Par23">Based on open hydroponic cultivation system in the present experiment, decreasing perlite particle size, increased the retention time of nutrient solution in the culture media. Increasing nutrient accessibility for plant roots by increasing retention time improves nutrient uptake and plant growth. However, the pure perlite culture system (100% perlite, &lt; 0.5 mm) has a very low air-filled porosity (AFP) of 33% and water holding capacity (WHC) of 56% in comparison with other fine-perlite culture media (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). Accordingly, the lowest growth parameters were obtained in pure perlite medium (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), which can be attributed to the rapid withdrawal of nutrient solution from the culture medium and the inability of the medium to maintain the nutrient solution. Due to the high porosity of peat mass and nutrient solution retention capability, an increase of the plant morphological parameters is expected in the presence of peat moss in various cultural media (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The noticeable increase in chlorophyll content by reducing perlite particle size implies the significant effect of culture media on photosynthesizing pigments (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). It has been reported that the application of N fertilizers in the fine perlite culture media increased N content of the plants, thereby increasing their chlorophyll content, subsequently, and their ability to absorb sunlight and produce photosynthates, which resulted in their higher leaf area, and growth and yield
