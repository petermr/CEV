Nitrogen increases photosynthetic efficiency and plays an important role in increasing the amount of essential oil by increasing the number and area of leave and providing a suitable condition for receiving sunlight energy and also participating in the structure of chlorophyll and enzymes involved in photosynthetic carbon metabolism

 </sup>. Besides, essential oils are terpenoids compounds whose constituent units (isonoids) such as isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethyl ally pyrophosphate are strongly formed into adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), and due to the effect of N in the production of these compounds, the amount of essential oil increased
