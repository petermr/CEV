 </sup>. However, using artificial substrates in the hydroponic cultivation system reduces the cost of establishing advanced hydroponic cultivation systems and also enables the farmer to make a practical use of it by using commonly raw materials such as cocopeat, sand, and vermiculite as an initial plant growing media

 </sup>. Nevertheless, different inorganic products such as peat moss, perlite, mixed materials, etc. are fully or partially used instead of initial substrates due to their useful physical properties. The particle size of substrates is a critical factor in air and water-holding capacity, root distribution, and plant growth, which are different based on their origin and preparation conditions. A high volume of roots can concentrate at the top portion of the container includes low aeration and high water-holding capacity
