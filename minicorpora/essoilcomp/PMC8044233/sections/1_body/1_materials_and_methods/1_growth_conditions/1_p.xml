<p id="Par8">The experiment was performed in a commercial greenhouse at Urmia University, West Azerbaijan, Iran. The air temperature was 22/18 °C (day/night) and the humidity ranged from 70 to 80%. The maximum photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) fluctuated from 550 to 750 μmol m
 <sup>−2</sup> s
 <sup>−1</sup> inside the greenhouse. The 
 <italic>E. purpurea</italic> seeds were purchased from Iranian private joint-stock company, Pakan Bazr Esfahan (www. Pakanbazr.com). The seeds were sowed in plastic cups filled with a mixture of perlite and peat moss substrates as a medium to initiate germination. Irrigation was performed based on greenhouse conditions regularly. Seedlings (with four real leaves) were translocated to experimental plastic pots (2.5 L) containing a different ratios of perlite and peat moss as artificial substrates (100% perlite, 100% peat moss, 50% (v) perlite + 50% (v) peat moss, 70% (v) perlite + 30% (v) peat moss) with various perlite particle size containing less than 0.5 mm, 0.5–1 mm, 1–1.5 mm, 1.5–2 mm, and more than 2 mm. Chemical concentrations of nutrient solution are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The pH and electrical conductivity (EC) of the nutrient solution were maintained between 5.7 to 6.2 and 1.0 to 1.5 dS m
