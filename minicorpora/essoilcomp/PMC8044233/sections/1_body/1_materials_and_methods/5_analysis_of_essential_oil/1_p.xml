<p id="Par13">The essential oil analysis was performed using gas chromatography (GC) with 30 m × 0.25 mm capillary column coated with 0.25 µm film; carrier gas, helium (He) with a flow rate of 32 cm s
 <sup>−1</sup>; injector temperature of 260 °C and injection volume 0.2 µL. The programming was carried out from 90 °C for 2 min rising at 7 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> to 180 °C, at 15 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> to 220 °C. Identifications of different components were made by library search program on monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids mass spectral database and by comparing retention time with those of reference samples
