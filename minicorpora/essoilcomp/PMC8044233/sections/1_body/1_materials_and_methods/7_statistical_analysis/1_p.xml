<p id="Par15">The statistics was based on the factorial with completely randomize design with three replications. The factors contained different sizes of perlite, including very coarse perlite (more than 2 mm), coarse perlite (1.5–2 mm), medium perlite (1–1.5 mm), fine perlite (0.5–1 mm), and very fine perlite (less than 0.5 mm), two NO
