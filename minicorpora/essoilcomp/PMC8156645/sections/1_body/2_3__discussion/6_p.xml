<p>Chronic treatment in an animal study demonstrated increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor, cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein, and protein kinase B expression, which finally modulated the monoamine neurotransmitter. In our study, we analyzed the effects of 
 <italic>Litsea cubeba</italic> and garlic oil on brainwaves using regional analysis. Positive and negative moods were evaluated during 
 <italic>Litsea cubeba</italic>, garlic, and 
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> oil inhalations. More numbers of volunteers are needed to assure the result of this type of behavior. The experiment and analysis were carried out to investigate each essential oil. The final products of food still require evaluation regarding brain activity and other psychophysiological functions. Brain functions and the psychophysiological responses can be investigated in the future. The knowledge obtained from this study can add value to both products and raw materials on the market.
