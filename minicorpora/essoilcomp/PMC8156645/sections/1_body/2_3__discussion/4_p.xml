<p>Garlic oil inhalation showed different effects between lower and higher concentrations. The alpha wave power was increased at the 1:16,000 dilution, and the alpha and beta wave powers were decreased at the 1:14,000 and 1:12,000 dilutions. Garlic oil demonstrated the lowest threshold property compared with 
 <italic>Litsea cubeba</italic> and 
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> oils. The increase in alpha wave power can be observed in several essential oil, such as white champaka, eucalyptus, lavender, and Zizyphus jujuba oils [
