<p>Several Thai herbs have been used for centuries as ingredients in famous Thai foods. Lemongrass, garlic, and 
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> are among the herbs used in Thai curry paste. Essential oils are released during the food preparation steps. We used 
 <italic>Litsea cubeba</italic> oil instead of lemon grass oil due to its industry-scale readiness. The main 
 <italic>Litsea cubeba</italic> components are citral and limonene, which are the same as in lemongrass. Limonene is also found in bergamot, caraway, eucalyptus, juniper, lemon, orange, and spearmint. In this study, we found that 
 <italic>Litsea cubeba</italic> oil reduced alpha and beta wave powers.
