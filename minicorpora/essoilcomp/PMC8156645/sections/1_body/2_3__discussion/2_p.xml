<p>The lower dilution, the 1:1000 dilution, caused clear changes of the brainwave powers in the temporal region. The stronger dilutions altered the brainwaves in a diffuse manner. The inhalation of 
 <italic>Litsea cubeba</italic> oil showed more positive moods over negative ones. Orange oil also showed the same results and showed a relaxant effect with a positive mood [

The odorants bind with odorant receptors and then send signals to the primary olfactory cortex, anterior olfactory nucleus, olfactory tubercle, piriform cortex, amygdala, and rostral entorhinal cortex. The piriform cortex, a sensory-associative cortex, connects with several high-order centers of the cerebral cortex. This connectivity pattern links to brain networks regulating cognition, memory, emotion, and behavior [
