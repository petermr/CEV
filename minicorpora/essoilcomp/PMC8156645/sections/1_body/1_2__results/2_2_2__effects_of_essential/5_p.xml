<p>Theta wave, alpha wave, and beta wave powers were decreased with the 1:14,000 and 1:12,000 dilutions. The alpha wave and beta wave powers showed no difference at the 1:10,000 dilution. The fast alpha wave power was increased in the frontal region during 1:16,000 oil dilution inhalation (

The fast alpha wave power was also increased in the centro-temporal and parieto-occipital regions. The mid beta wave power was decreased in the parieto-occipital region. Slight changes of brainwave power were observed in the frontal and centro-temporal regions during 1:14,000 dilution inhalation (
