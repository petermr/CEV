 <italic>Litsea cubeba</italic> oil inhalation produced a reduction in brain wave powers at the 1:1,000, 1:400, 1:100, and undiluted dilutions. For lower concentrations—the 1:1,000 and 1:400 dilutions—theta, alpha, and beta wave powers were reduced compared with the control. The alpha and beta wave powers were decreased with the 1:100 and undiluted dilution (
