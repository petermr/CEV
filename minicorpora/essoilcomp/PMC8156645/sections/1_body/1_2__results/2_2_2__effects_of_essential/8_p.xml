<p>For mood evaluation, we chose three oilsâ€”
 <italic>Litsea cubeba</italic> oil, garlic oil, and 
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> oil. Happy, serenity, lethargic, and stress emotions were assessed for each dilution. The average values of each oil perception are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02939-f011">Figure 11</xref>. 
 <italic>Litsea cubeba</italic> oil and 
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> oil showed more scores of positive moods. Happy and serene feelings with the 
 <italic>Litsea cubeba</italic> and 
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> oils were higher than with garlic oil inhalation. However, garlic oil inhalation showed more lethargy and stress feelings than with 
 <italic>Litsea cubeba</italic> oil and 
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> oil inhalations.
