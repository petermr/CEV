<p>For the 1:100 and undiluted dilutions, the results showed a reduction in both alpha and beta wave powers among frontal, centro-temporal, parieto-occipital regions (

 <italic>Litsea cubeba</italic> oil inhalations suggested a sedative effect of this oil inhalation. Due to the low threshold of garlic oil, we chose 1:16,000, 1:14,000, 1:12,000, and 1:10,000 dilutions as the supra-threshold concentrations. The results showed that alpha wave power increased with the 1:16,000 dilution but the beta wave power decreased (
