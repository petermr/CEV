<p>Low and high beta wave powers were increased in the frontal region, and the fast beta wave power was also increased in the centro-temporal region. The low beta wave power was decreased in the centrotemporal region. The parieto-occipital region showed clear changes during the 1:14,000 dilution oil inhalation. The alpha and beta wave powers were decreased. The slow alpha wave component was decreased, and all beta wave components were decreased in the parieto-occipital region. Interestingly, stronger garlic oil dilutions showed different alterations. The alpha wave power, especially the slow alpha wave power, was decreased in the frontal region during the 1:12,000 oil inhalation.</p>
