<p>The electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded using a SynAmps RT 64-channel amplifier (Compumedics Limited, Victoria, Australia). The subjects wore an electrode cap, Quikcap, on their heads, and nineteen channels were loaded with Quikgel to reduce the impedance. FP1, FP2, F3, F1, FZ, F4, F8, T7, C3, CZ, C6, T8, P7, P3, PZ, P4, P8, O1, and O2 electrodes were recorded with a sampling rate of 1 kHz. M1 and M2 were the reference electrodes. Five kÎ© was accepted for the electrode impedance. The raw data during the eye-closed periods were then analyzed with a triplicate of a 10 s epoch size.</p>
