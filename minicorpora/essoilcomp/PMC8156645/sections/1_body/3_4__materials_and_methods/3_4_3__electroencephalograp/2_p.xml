<p>The raw data were processed, filtered, and artifact-reduced using Curry 7 software (Compumedics Limited, Victoria, Australia). Notch filter at 50 Hz was processed. High pass and low pass filters were set to 1 Hz and 30 Hz, respectively. Three 10 s epochs of the eyes closed period were chosen to be analyzed per testing condition. Eye blink artifacts were removed using electrooculographic electrode VEO as a probe. The time-domain data were then transformed into frequency-domain data using fast Fourier transform. Power spectral analysis was finally performed to clearly display the differences among frequencies. The total brain response was processed and displayed in a bar graph. For the regional analysis, electrodes were chosen and were divided into three categories consisting of the frontal region (FP1, FP2, F3, F1, FZ, F4, and F8), centro-temporal region (T7, C3, CZ, C6, and T8), and parieto-occipital region (P7, P3, PZ, P4, P8, O1, and O2).</p>
