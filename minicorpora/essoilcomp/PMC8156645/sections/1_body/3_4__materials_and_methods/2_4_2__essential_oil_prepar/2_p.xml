<p>The compounds were identified by their retention indices and their mass spectra. The components of the oil were identified by comparison of their mass spectra fragmentation and computer matching using the Wiley 7n libraries (Database/ChemStation data system). The experimental protocol was adapted from Sowndhararajan et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-02939" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The subjects were asked to sit quietly in a recliner to limit movement of their head. The essential oil application was modified from other studies. Three dilutions were prepared for each oil using seventy percent ethanol as a carrier. The subjects were asked to open and close their eyes for three-minute intervals during the absence and presence of essential oils. The blinking was allowed to naturally occur during eyes open period. Fifty microliters of each different dilution of oil were dropped onto a filter paper. The filter paper with or without the essential oil was then attached to the subjectâ€™s nose. An electroencephalogram was recorded during the non-task resting state.
