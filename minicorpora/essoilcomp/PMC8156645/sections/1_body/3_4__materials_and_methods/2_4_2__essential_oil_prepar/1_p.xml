 <italic>Litsea cubeba</italic>, garlic, and 
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> oils extracted by steam distillation were obtained from Thai China Flavours &amp; Fragrances Company Limited (Nonthaburi, Thailand). The oils were analyzed by a 6890/5973 GC–MS instrument (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) using two VF-WAXms columns (30 m × 250 µm, film thickness 0.25 μm). The oven temperature was held at 35 °C for 4 min and then was programmed to 200 °C at 10 °C/min for 5 min and then to 270 °C at 5 °C/min for 10 min; the injector and detector temperatures were set at 270 °C, and the ion source temperature was 150 °C; the helium carrier gas flow rate was 1 mL/min; the splitless injection was 75 mL/min for 0.5 min; the injection volume was 1 μL (Chromatograms provided in
