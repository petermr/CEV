<p>Fragrances or odorants have effects on human psychophysiology. The perception of fragrances is enabled by odorants and odorant receptors in the olfactory system. Aromatherapy is an alternative medicine using fragrances in treatments to heal a person’s ailments, purportedly, in terms of mind, body, and soul [

 <italic>Litsea cubeba</italic> aroma is similar to lemongrass with more citrus notes. Turmeric and garlic are widely used as an ingredient in traditional cooking due to their unique aromas. The unique aroma of turmeric is dependent on a combination of ar-turmerone and β-turmerone with α-curcumene, β-sesquiphellandrene, and other kinds of alcohols. The garlic aroma is from the sulfur-based substances—thiosulfinates and their degradation products [

 <italic>Litsea cubeba</italic>, garlic, and 
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> oils share components with several types of essential-oil-bearing plants. Limonene is found in 
 <italic>Litsea cubeba</italic>, lemongrass, bergamot, caraway, eucalyptus, lemon, etc. Phellandrene is found in 
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic>, rosemary, eucalyptus, etc. Essential oil affects the human nervous system depending on its composition and concentration [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-02939" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Inhalation of essential oil has been reported to alter the arousal state of the human brain ranging from stimulatory effects to sedative effects. Alterations of psychophysiological and brain functions in response to odors have been found in the medicinal and cosmetic industries. There is no evidence regarding 
 <italic>Litsea cubeba</italic>, garlic, and 
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> essential oil inhalations on human brain responses; therefore, in this study, we investigated the effects of essential oil inhalation on human brain responses and moods. We hypothesized the stimulating effect of garlic oil and sedative effect of 
 <italic>Litsea cubeba</italic> oil base on the increase in dopamine and serotonin levels and γ-aminobutyric acid receptor inhibition, respectively.
