<p>The antifungal activity of eugenol, its analogues, and derivatives was also confirmed in various studies. It was reported that while eugenol is almost inactive against 
 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic>, the isoeugenol shows a moderate inhibitory effect on the same fungi. Another study showed that both eugenol and its analogues exhibit effectiveness against a variety of fungus species, for instance 
 <italic>Penicilium</italic>, 
 <italic>Altermaria</italic>, and 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> spp. [

 <xref rid="B52-ijms-22-03671" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] performed an investigation on the effect of eugenol and its derivatives on fungus 
 <italic>Botrytris cinerea</italic>, which causes gray mold disease. This species is considered a serious worldwide problem as it causes high losses in fresh fruit crops [
 <xref rid="B53-ijms-22-03671" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In their study, the antifungal activity was evaluated using a resistant 
 <italic>Botrytris cinerea</italic> native isolate obtained from cherry fruit. The results indicated that the chemical modification of eugenol causes significant changes in the antifungal activity. In this case, modifications included changes in the existing functional groups and the addition of a nitrogen-containing group on the aromatic ring. It was established that an increase in antifungal activity and growth inhibition is connected with conjugation of the side-chain double bound with the aromatic system. Moreover, it was considered that growth inhibition caused by eugenol derivatives is probably a consequence of two different mechanismsâ€”accumulation of compounds in the fungal membrane due to lipophilic interactions and Michael-type reactions between eugenol derivatives and components of the fungal membrane or production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by enzymatic reduction of nitro compounds.
