<p>Eugenol derivatives show enhanced antifungal activity compared to the pure form of this compound. In their studies, Maximino et al. [
 <xref rid="B47-ijms-22-03671" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] investigated the fungicidal effects of eugenol and its derivatives on 
 <italic>Fusarium solani</italic> f. sp. 
 <italic>piperis</italic>. Results showed that 2-(4-allyl-2-methoxyphenoxy)-3-chloronaphthalene-1,4-dione was the most effective eugenol derivative on the fungus viability. This high activity is probably connected to the eugenol scaffold and its structure, which contains the naphthoquinone moiety. Naphthoquinones are considered useful compounds in the development of agrochemicals due to their characteristics, such as non-toxic nature, redox properties, and antimicrobial activity [

 <xref rid="B50-ijms-22-03671" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Moreover, the mentioned derivative exhibited superior antifungal activity to effects performed by tebuconazole to which the investigated fungus developed resistance [
