<p>Eugenol was also found to enhance the cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic activity of cisplatin, a cytostatic drug, in both in vivo and in vitro studies on triple-negative breast tumors [
 <xref rid="B28-ijms-22-03671" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The addition of eugenol is believed to enhance the inhibition of breast cancer stem cells by cisplatin by inhibiting the activity of aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH) and ALDH-positive tumor initiating cells and enhancing NF-ÎºB signaling pathway inhibition. These results suggest that combination therapy based on eugenol and cisplatin may be an effective therapy for triple-negative breast tumors.
