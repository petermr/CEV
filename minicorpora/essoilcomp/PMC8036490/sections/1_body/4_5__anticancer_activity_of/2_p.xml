<p>Evidence suggests that eugenol can affect cancer cells as an antioxidant, preventing mutation, and as a pro-oxidant, influencing signal pathways and killing cancer cells. The molecular mechanism is believed to include various stages: inhibiting NF-κB activation, downregulating prostaglandin synthesis, reducing cyclooxygenase-2 activity, inducing cell cycle arrest in the S phase, and causing apoptotic cell death by lowering inflammatory cytokine levels [

 <xref rid="B3-ijms-22-03671" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] suggest that eugenol may have chemotherapeutic properties against human lung cancer. An in vitro study conducted on human embryonic lung fibroblast MRC-5 and lung cancer adenocarcinoma cells A549 found that even a low dose of eugenol interfered with the migration and invasion of carcinogenic cells, inhibited lung cancer cell viability, and prevented metastasis by blocking the PI3K/Akt pathway (an intracellular signaling pathway involved in cell cycle regulation) and inhibiting MMP (matrix metalloproteinase) activity. The compound was also found to demonstrate cytotoxic effects against normal cells and lung cancer cells at higher doses (1000 μM).
