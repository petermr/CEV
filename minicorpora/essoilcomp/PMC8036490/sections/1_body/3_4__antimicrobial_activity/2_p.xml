<p>In 
 <italic>Enterobacter aerogenes</italic>, it has been proposed that the hydroxyl group on eugenol inhibits the action of protease, histidine carboxylase, and amylase by binding to them ([

 <xref rid="B18-ijms-22-03671" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]). Similarly, eugenol has been found to potentially inhibit the activity of membrane-bound ATPase in 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> [
