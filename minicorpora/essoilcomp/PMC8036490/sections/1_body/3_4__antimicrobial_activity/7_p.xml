<p>The study on eugenol showed that this compound has synergistic activity with various antibiotics, such as vancomycin, penicillin, ampicillin, and erythromycin, and the combination of these compounds allowed a reduction in MIC values of 5â€“1000 times compared to the MIC values of individual compounds used alone. Moreover, eugenol has been shown to potentiate the action of lysozyme and SDS, which are used to damage bacterial cell membranes. Mass administration of antibiotics is a serious global problem, as it promotes the spread of antibiotic-resistant strains of pathogens, so limiting their use to the natural compound as eugenol seems to be a potential solution [
