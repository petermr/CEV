<p>Olszewska et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-ijms-22-03671" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] examined the above-mentioned compounds, which are components of essential oils, in regard to their ability to inhibit the growth of the 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> biofilm. The study was performed on the basis of the platelet count, resazurin test, and Syto
 <sup>®</sup> 9/PI (-/propidium iodide) staining in combination with flow cytometry (FCM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Antibiofilm tests–resazurin assay and plate counts showed that eugenol at a concentration of 3 mM caused a significant decrease in the metabolic activity of bacterial cells, which are part of the biofilm (49%), and in culturability (84%), but compared to other compounds tested, eugenol showed the lowest ability to damage the microbial cell membrane.
