 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (CRKP). 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> is a very dangerous pathogen that poses a risk to humans and animals due to its resistance to antimicrobial agents and antibiotics. This bacterium exhibits many virulence factors, e.g., the ability to create biofilms or the presence of capsular polysaccharide and outer membrane proteins. Carbapenem-resistant CRKP strains are a particularly significant threat, so it is so important to find an effective agent to combat or weaken this pathogen. Eugenol seems to be a potential compound showing antibacterial activity against this microorganism, as it has demonstrated multidirectional activity. Minimal inhibitory concentration of eugenol was determined by the agar dilution method, and the MIC against the four tested CRKP isolates was 0.2 mg/mL for eugenol. Importantly, a certain relationship was noticedâ€”with the increase in eugenol concentration, the degree of cell damage and the number of damaged cells increased. The antimicrobial mechanism of eugenol was damage to the cell membrane: disruption of the cell membrane and swelling of the cells, cell membrane hyperpolarization and enhanced membrane permeability, and, finally, leakage of intracellular components of CRKP cells.
