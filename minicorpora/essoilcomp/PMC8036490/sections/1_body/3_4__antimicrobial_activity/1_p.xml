<p>Eugenol has demonstrated antibacterial properties against many species, such as 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and this potential has been attributed to the free OH group in its structure. Against Gram-negative bacteria, eugenol is believed to act by damaging the cytoplasmic membrane; being a hydrophobic molecule, it can easily penetrate the lipopolysaccharide cell membrane and enter the cytoplasm. Once present in the cell, it can cause alterations to the cell structure, resulting in the leakage of intracellular components.
