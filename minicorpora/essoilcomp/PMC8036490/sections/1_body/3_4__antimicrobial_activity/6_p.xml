<p>Sharifzadeh and Shokri [
 <xref rid="B22-ijms-22-03671" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] investigated the antifungal potential of eugenol using the broth microdilution test and the likely synergistic effect of eugenol with voriconazole in vitro against 
 <italic>Candida</italic> strains isolated from mares’ reproductive tract using the checkerboard microdilution method. Eugenol MIC values for eugenol were 400–800 µg/mL for 
 <italic>Candida tropicalis</italic> and 200–400 µg/mL for 
 <italic>Candida krusei</italic>. Synergistic effects of eugenol and voriconazole were observed for 
 <italic>Candida tropicalis</italic> (83.3%) and 
 <italic>Candida krusei</italic> (77.7%), and no antagonistic activity occurred. Consequently, eugenol is a potential antifungal agent designed to fight the genital 
 <italic>Candida</italic> yeast. Moreover, the combination therapy of eugenol and voriconazole may prove effective in antimicrobial resistance in mares with genital candidiasis.
