<p>The biofilm formed by bacteria on medical implants and biomaterials is also a common source of bacterial infection. Studies have found that a hydrophilic copolymer system based on eugenol effectively inhibited the growth of such bacteria. The general mechanism of action of eugenol on bacterial biofilm includes inhibition of biofilm formation and reduced viability of biofilm-forming cells. Other effects included dispersion of cells in the biofilm matrix, inactivation of biofilm bacterial cells, and inhibition of biofilm-associated gene expression (for example, the pgaA gene) [
