<p>Da Silva et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-ijms-22-03671" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] also report that eugenol derivatives demonstrated a higher antimicrobial potential than eugenol: the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against bacteria was found to be 500 µg/mL for the derivatives and 1000 µg/mL for eugenol. The derivatives were formed by the esterification of the hydroxyl group (-OH) with various carboxylic acid derivatives or by the addition of functional groups to the double bond of the allyl group.
