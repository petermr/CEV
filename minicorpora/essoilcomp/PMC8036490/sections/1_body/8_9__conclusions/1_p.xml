<p>Due to its wide range of biological activities, eugenol has many applications. It is commonly found in soaps or perfumes as a fragrance; however, it is also used in medicine and pharmacology, most commonly as a local antiseptic and analgesic, and as an anti-inflammatory agent in inhalation and aerosol therapy. More importantly, it has also demonstrated therapeutic potential in drugs, including those intended to fight cancer. Eugenol also has a synergistic effect with various antibiotics, for example, vancomycin, penicillin, and erythromycin. By potentiating their action, it reduces their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), which has the effect of reducing antibiotic resistance among pathogens. Unfortunately, high concentrations of eugenol can be pro-oxidative and harmful, but doses below 2.5 mg/kg body weight are regarded as safe by the FAO. Moreover, eugenol may cause allergies (for instance, allergic contact dermatitis) in some cases, especially in dental workers. Eugenol derivatives are also an important group of compounds and a popular research object. Eugenol derivatives appear to be promising ingredients in pesticides, including insecticides.</p>
