<p>In silico bioinformatics studies by Das Chagas Pereira de Andrade and Mendes [
 <xref rid="B31-ijms-22-03671" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] found that eugenol may inhibit both COX-2 and 5-LOX. It is therefore possible that eugenol may act as an anti-inflammatory agent, thus allowing it to replace some NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) in various diseases; it could also be used in the synthesis of new selective drugs to fight diseases associated with inflammatory processes, such as osteoarthritis or cancer.
