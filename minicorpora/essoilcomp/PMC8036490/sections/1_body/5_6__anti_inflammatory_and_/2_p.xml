<p>Evidence suggests that eugenol has the ability to inhibit the production of superoxide anions in neutrophils by inhibiting the Raf/MEK/ERK1/2/p47-phosphorylation pathway. It is also known to be an inhibitor of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β and IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), prostaglandin E
 <sub>2</sub> (PGE
 <sub>2</sub>), expression of inducible oxide nitrate synthase (iNOS) and expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), and leukotriene C4 and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) [

Its anti-inflammatory activity is associated with preventing neutrophil/macrophage chemotaxis and inhibiting the synthesis of inflammatory neurotransmitters, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes; in addition, eugenol dimers have shown chemopreventive properties by inhibiting cytokine expression in macrophages (
