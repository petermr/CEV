<p>Eugenol has low chemical stability and is sensitive to oxidation and various chemical interactions. When orally administered, it is rapidly absorbed by various organs and metabolized in the liver. Therefore, encapsulation of eugenol seems to be the best solution to prevent early absorption, improve its water solubility, and, thus, increase its activity (e.g., it has been reported that the amount of eugenol delivered increases at least sixfold in infected cells when delivered as solid lipid nanoparticles [
