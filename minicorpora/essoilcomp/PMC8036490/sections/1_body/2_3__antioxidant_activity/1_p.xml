 <xref rid="B13-ijms-22-03671" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Eugenol is known to scavenge free radicals, inhibit the generation of reactive oxygen species, prevent the production of reactive forms of nitrogen, increase cyto-antioxidant potential, and protect the function of microbial DNA and proteins. Eugenol can also help repair oxidative damage, eliminate damaged molecules, and prevent mutations that could develop into cancer [
