<p>Both clove oil and eugenol demonstrate strong antioxidant potential. Pérez-Rosés et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-ijms-22-03671" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] found both to have a strong DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging effect (half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) = 13.2 μg/mL for clove oil; 11.7 μg/mL for eugenol) and to inhibit reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in human neutrophils stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 7.5 μg/mL for clove oil; 1.6 μg/mL for eugenol) or H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 22.6 μg/mL for clove oil; 27.1 μg/mL for eugenol). They also inhibit the production of nitric oxide (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 39.8 μg/mL for clove oil; 19.0 μg/mL for eugenol) and demonstrate high myeloperoxidase (MPO) inhibition in human leukocytes (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 16.3 μg/mL for clove oil; 19.2 μg/mL for eugenol).
