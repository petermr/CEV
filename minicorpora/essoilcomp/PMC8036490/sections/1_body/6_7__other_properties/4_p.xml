<p>Due to eugenol’s multidirectional activity, including antibacterial and antifungal, it has applications in agriculture and the food industry. Its beneficial effect is associated with low concentrations of effective action, which is an important advantage. Additionally, eugenol is effective against many foodborne pathogens (for example, 
 <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus ochraceus</italic>), so its use prevents acute food poisoning. The anti-salmonella activity of eugenol includes a decrease in the permeability of the pathogen’s cell membrane, followed by ion leakage, loss of cellular content, and ultimately cell death [

 <italic>Salmonella</italic> through inhibition of its growth in soil. Eugenol is also able to inhibit the production of ochratoxin A by 
 <italic>Aspergillus ochraceus.</italic> Its antifungal properties are harnessed to protect fruits, such as strawberries, apples, and peaches, and their juices against the harmful effects of microorganisms (

 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. Studies suggest that the effects of eugenol on 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> are based on its ability to inhibit the production of staphylococcal enterotoxin A and B and toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 as well as the expression of alpha-hemolysin [
