<p>Limonoids are a secondary metabolite class of highly oxygenated modified triterpenes. This compound is biosynthesized by the acetateâ€“mevalonate pathway and is also known as a tetranorterpenoid because its biosynthesis occurs through oxidative processes of side-chain degradation, resulting in the loss of four carbon atoms and the formation of a furan ring [
