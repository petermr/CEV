<p>Da Silva et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-05401" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] report part of a biogenetic map for limonoids featuring all structural types found in Meliaceae. Route 1.1.2 shows the B,D-seco class, which is characteristic of Swietenioideae, as previously mentioned. This route is related to the most commonly found limonoid class in the genus 
 <italic>Cedrela</italic>. As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05401-t011" ref-type="table">Table 11</xref>, other classes were found; one can affirm that they are associated with the B,D-ring class as biosynthetic intermediaries.
