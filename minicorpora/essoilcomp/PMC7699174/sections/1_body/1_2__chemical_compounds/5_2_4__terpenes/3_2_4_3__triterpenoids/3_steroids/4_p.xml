<p>Limonoids are divided into ten classes, including fifteen types based on different seco- styles, carbon-chain styles, and ring types [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-05401" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This classification was presented by Fang et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-05401" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], who sought to identify the class and type of limonoids isolated from the 
 <italic>Cedrela</italic> species. 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05401-t010" ref-type="table">Table 10</xref> shows the analysis performed with 55 chemical structures of limonoids isolated from different 
 <italic>Cedrela</italic> species found in this review, showing the different seco-styles and carbon frameworks of these limonoid types.
