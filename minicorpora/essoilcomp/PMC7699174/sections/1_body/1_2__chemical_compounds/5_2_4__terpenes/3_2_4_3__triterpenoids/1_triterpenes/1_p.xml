<p>Triterpenes, one of the largest classes of natural plant products, are initially formed from squalene, following complex enzymatic reactions [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-25-05401" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, in addition to the need for specific enzymes for cyclization, it also depends on the conformation of squalene, yielding mainly oleanane, ursane, lupane, and dammarane carbon skeletons [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-25-05401" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Triterpenes have a range of biological effects and are used in the prevention and treatment of some diseases [
