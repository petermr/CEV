<p>Triterpenes were the most active compounds. Tirucallane triterpenes (
 <bold>127</bold>â€“
 <bold>129</bold>), isolated from methanol stem extract, stood out for their high activity that could be justified by the presence of the hydroxyl group at C-3 and the cyclization of the side chain to a dihydroxy-tetrahydrofuran. Leite et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-05401" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] reported that compound 
 <bold>127</bold> showed better activity than the positive control, demonstrating its potential to act as a substitute for gentian violet, which presents collateral effects; however, a toxicity assessment must be carried out. Moreover, 
 <italic>C. fissilis</italic> proved to be efficient in the production of compounds that can be used to control Chagas disease.
