<p>Regarding interference in photosynthesis, the authors evaluated the effects of compounds on different photosynthetic reactions. Based on the obtained results and compared to other group studies, Céspedes et al. [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-25-05401" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] assert that compound 
 <bold>164</bold> inhibits the proton chain (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 34.9 µM) and further suggests that it can inhibit all the electron transport chain of water to methyl viologen at the phosphorylation of photosynthesis of water to methyl viologen (inhibited totally at 60 µM; IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 29.5 µM). The authors associated electron transport inhibition to the oxygenated functions of compound 
 <bold>164</bold>, which significantly increased the inhibition potency that was similar to that of the Hill’s reaction inhibiting effect of some commercial herbicides.
