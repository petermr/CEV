<p>In the case of growth inhibition, no significant influence on 
 <italic>T. vulgare</italic> growth (100% inhibited at 500 μM) was observed and a lower inhibition effect on 
 <italic>L. multiflorum</italic> (300 μM), indicating that the mechanism of action of compound 
 <bold>164</bold> could be different for germination and respiration. The authors affirmed that, based on a pre-emergency assay, oxygenated functions of the molecule played an inhibition role in germination due to lipophilicity or the hydrophilicity of the oxygenated function of compound 
 <bold>164</bold> (at physiological pH), making it difficult for compound 
 <bold>164</bold> to reach the target site.
