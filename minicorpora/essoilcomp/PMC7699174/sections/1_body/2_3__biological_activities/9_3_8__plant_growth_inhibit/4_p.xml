<p>As for growth inhibition, a dose-dependent pattern was shown, which stimulated or inhibited germination for both seeds. In the case of monocot seeds, there were inhibitory effects of the photogedunin mixture on root and coleoptile development, whereas, in dicot seeds, the promotion of root and hypocotyl development was observed. Nonetheless, according to the authors, the root developed to a greater extent than coleoptile or hypocotyl development (the lowest median infective dose (ID
 <sub>50</sub>) values). Higher ID
 <sub>50</sub> values showed that dicot seed growth was more sensitive to photogedunin acetate mixture.
