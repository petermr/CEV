<p>With respect to dry weight and respiration, these decrease with increases in photogedunin mixture concentration; however, the 
 <italic>L. multiflorum</italic> respiration rate was one exception, as it was more sensitive to inhibition while 
 <italic>T. alexandrinum</italic> showed higher resistance. This suggests that the photogedunin mixture acted as an uncoupler to phosphorylation at low concentrations, but at higher concentrations it either inhibited energy transduction or the respiration redox enzymes. It was shown that the photogedunin epimeric mixture was more selective and potent towards monocots than dicots.
