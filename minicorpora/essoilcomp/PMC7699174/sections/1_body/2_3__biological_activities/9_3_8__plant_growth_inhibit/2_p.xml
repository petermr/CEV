<p>Céspedes et al. [
 <xref rid="B66-molecules-25-05401" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] accomplished bioactivity-guided isolation, in which heartwood parts of 
 <italic>C. dugesii</italic> were extracted with CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub> against two monocots seeds. The authors were able to verify the most active fraction (F3—
 <italic>L. multiflorum</italic> = IC
 <sub>50</sub> 24.0 μg/mL; 
 <italic>T. vulgare</italic> = IC
 <sub>50</sub> 23.0 μg/mL) and to arrive at the compound responsible for the activity, which was an epimeric mixture of compounds 
 <bold>177</bold> and 
 <bold>178</bold>.
