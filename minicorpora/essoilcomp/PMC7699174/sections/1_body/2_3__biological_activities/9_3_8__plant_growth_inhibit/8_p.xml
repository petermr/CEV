<p>In general, if compared to the Céspedes et al. [
 <xref rid="B66-molecules-25-05401" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] assays with 
 <bold>177</bold> and 
 <bold>178</bold>, 
 <bold>164</bold> showed a better inhibition profile. Concentration-dependent, 
 <bold>164</bold> inhibited respiration, germination, shoot and root elongation, and dry weight of the tested species, especially monocot species. It is worth pointing out that 
 <italic>L. multiflorum</italic> was shown to be the most susceptible to this compound, with GI
 <sub>50</sub> 120.6 μM, and causing 100% germination inhibition at 300 μM.
