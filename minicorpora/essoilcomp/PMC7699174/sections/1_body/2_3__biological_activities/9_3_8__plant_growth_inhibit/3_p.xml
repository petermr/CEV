<p>The epimeric mixture of compounds 
 <bold>177</bold> and 
 <bold>178</bold> and semi-synthetic acetylated derivatives were reported in Céspedes et al. [
 <xref rid="B75-molecules-25-05401" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] (compounds 
 <bold>177a</bold> and 
 <bold>178a</bold>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05401-f004">Figure 4</xref>), and were assessed for phytotoxic effects on monocot and dicot seed germination. Both compounds and mixtures showed similar inhibition profiles; however, monocot seeds (
 <italic>T. vulgare</italic> and 
 <italic>L. mutlifloreum</italic>) were most sensitive at 50 μM and 500 μM, respectively, for photogedunin epimeric acetates, presenting with an almost 100% inhibition. Comparing concentrations that inhibit 50% of seed germination (GI
 <sub>50</sub>), the low values for photogedunin acetate mixtures showed that they were better inhibitors. Moreover, this comparison allowed speculation that the low activity of the mixture of compounds 
 <bold>177</bold> and 
 <bold>178</bold> could be related to the hydrophilicity of the free C-23, where the hydroxyl group makes it difficult for photogedunin to reach the target.
