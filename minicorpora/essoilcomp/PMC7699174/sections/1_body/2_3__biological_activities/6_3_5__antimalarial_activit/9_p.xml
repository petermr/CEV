<p>Comparing compound 
 <bold>181</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: D6 = 39 ng/mL − W2 = 20 ng/mL) with compound 
 <bold>181a</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: D6 = &gt;10000 ng/mL − W2 = 840 ng/mL), compound 
 <bold>181b</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: D6 = 2580 ng/mL − W2 = 980 ng/mL), and compound 
 <bold>181c</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: D6 = 4210 ng/mL − W2 = 2440 ng/mL) a decrease in activity was noted when unsaturation was reduced (
 <bold>181a</bold>), epoxidation to the 1,2-β-epoxy derivative (
 <bold>181b</bold>), or unsaturation and ketone reductions to 1,2 dihydro-β-gedunol (
 <bold>181c</bold>). In all these cases, activity against both clones was reduced, mainly D6.
