<p>Extracts of all parts tested of 
 <italic>C. fissilis</italic> were inactive for both clones (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 20 µg/mL), whereas 
 <italic>C. odorata</italic> wood and 
 <italic>C. salvadorensis</italic> leaf extracts were two of the most active against clones D6 and W2 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &lt; 20 µg/mL). However, compared to the other extracts tested, 
 <italic>C. odorata</italic> showed higher activity. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for these
