<p>Among the semi-synthetic derivatives, only compounds 
 <bold>181j</bold> and 
 <bold>181l</bold> showed antiplasmodial activity, although it was lower than the activity of compound 
 <bold>181</bold>. The in vivo bioassay was accomplished with compound 
 <bold>181j</bold>, due to lower molecular weight, and was relatively active. This compound showed better activity than compound 
 <bold>181</bold> when given alone and in binary treatment, with a clearance of 67.5% ± 1.3% (50 mg·kg
 <sup>−1</sup>·day
 <sup>−1</sup>) and 80.7% ± 5.1% (50 mg·kg
 <sup>−1</sup>·day
 <sup>−1</sup> of compound 
 <bold>181j</bold> and 25 mg·kg
 <sup>−1</sup>·day
 <sup>−1</sup> of dillapiol), respectively. When compared to a conventional drug used in antimalarial therapy (quinine = 60 ± 10%—10 mg·kg
 <sup>−1</sup>·day
 <sup>−1</sup>), these compounds showed promising results, which could contribute to the development of effective phytomedicines based on traditionally used antimalarial plants.
