<p>Oral administration of compound 
 <bold>181</bold> and dillapiol in CD-1 mice infected with 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic> showed better parasite clearance (79.0% ± 5.3%), in which the increase was dose-dependent with compound 
 <bold>181</bold> doses up to 50 mg·kg
 <sup>−1</sup>·day
 <sup>−1</sup>, with dillapiol held constant at 25 mg·kg
 <sup>−1</sup>·day
 <sup>−1</sup>. In addition, the mean blood concentration of compound 
 <bold>181</bold> increased to 13.1 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, which could be related to cytochrome P450 inhibition in the small intestine, although the dillapiol penetrant properties may play a role. Regarding the toxicity of the binary treatment, preliminary studies show that there were no significant differences in total body or organ weight, gross anatomy, or three liver enzyme levels relative to the control group; nevertheless, chronic toxicity studies need to be carried out.
