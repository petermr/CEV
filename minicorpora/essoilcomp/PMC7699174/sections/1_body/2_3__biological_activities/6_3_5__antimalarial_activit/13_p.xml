<p>Considering the low in vivo activity present in the MacKinnon et al. [
 <xref rid="B70-molecules-25-05401" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] study, Omar et al. [
 <xref rid="B71-molecules-25-05401" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] mentioned possible reasons, for instance: “poor solubility and uptake of the drug due to its lipophilicity”; “first-pass metabolism of gedunin by cytochrome P450 enzymes of the small intestine, which reduce plasma levels of drugs; and hydrolysis of gedunin to the inactive and unstable metabolite, 7-deacetylgedunin” [
 <xref rid="B71-molecules-25-05401" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] (p. 135). Thus, Omar et al. [
 <xref rid="B71-molecules-25-05401" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] carried out compound co-precipitation with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) for oral administration; compounds were tested alone and in binary treatment, where the compound was administered with dillapiol, a cytochrome P450 inhibitor. Another approach was that the semi-synthetic derivatives (compounds

 <bold>181k</bold>, and 
 <bold>181l</bold>,
