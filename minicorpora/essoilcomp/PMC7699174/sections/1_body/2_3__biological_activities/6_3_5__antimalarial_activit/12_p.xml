<p>Finally, the majority of the compounds showed activity against chloroquine-resistant clones, with compound 
 <bold>181</bold> having a lower IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of than chloroquine. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of these compounds was evaluated using KB cells, as described previously by Likhitwitayawuid et al. [
 <xref rid="B93-molecules-25-05401" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>], and an in vivo assay of compound 
 <bold>181</bold>. For the cytotoxicity assay, compounds 
 <bold>181</bold> (2300 ng/mL), 
 <bold>181g</bold> (9400 ng/mL), and 
 <bold>181h</bold> (10,900 ng/mL) presented some cytotoxicity; however, less than drugs usually used to treat malaria, chloroquine (17,400 ng/mL), quinine (&gt;20,000 ng/mL), mefloquine (3500 ng/mL), and artemisinin (&gt;20,000 ng/mL), suggesting a possible new antimalarial. For the in vivo assay, where compound 
 <bold>181</bold> was administered orally or subcutaneously to mice infected with 
 <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic>, during a four-day test, there was no inhibition of parasitemia. Nonetheless, according to the authors, the biological potential of compounds requires further study because of the focus on traditional remedies in Africa.
