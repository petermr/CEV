<p>The action mechanism of limonoids is not clear; however, it could be related to physiological effects, with the oxygenated function at C-23 being necessary for the activity of compounds 
 <bold>177</bold>, 
 <bold>178</bold>, 
 <bold>177a</bold>, 
 <bold>178a</bold>, and 
 <bold>181</bold>; the authors suggest, based on Champagne et al. [
 <xref rid="B99-molecules-25-05401" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>] and Isman et al. [
 <xref rid="B100-molecules-25-05401" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>], that there could be a combination between antifeedant action and/or post-digestive toxicity, as found for other limonoids. Moreover, although the compounds tested showed activity compared to the positive control, except 
 <bold>164</bold>, suggesting additional production, none of them demonstrated the outstanding activity of azadirachtin [
