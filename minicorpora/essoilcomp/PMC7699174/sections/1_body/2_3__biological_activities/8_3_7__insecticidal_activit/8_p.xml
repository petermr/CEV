 <xref rid="B98-molecules-25-05401" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Only one neonate first instar larvae was placed in contact with the diet, for seven days, with different concentrations and compounds, inclusively with a positive control (toosendanin). After seven days, surviving larvae were transferred to separate vials containing a fresh stock diet for 21 days, and weight gains, mortality, and other lifecycle measurements were evaluated.
