 <italic>A. sexdensrubropilosa</italic> ants and was also tested by Ambrozin et al. [
 <xref rid="B67-molecules-25-05401" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] using the same previously mentioned methodology. The limonoids tested and the control showed the same survival medium time; however, compound 
 <bold>184</bold> presented a significant difference to the control according to the log-rank test (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). All these limonoids are of the gedunin type, and the authors affirmed that this type does not seem to be highly active against these ants. The authors further suggest that the toxicity of 
 <italic>C. fissilis</italic> extract could be associated with the synergism between limonoids and other compounds in the extracts.
