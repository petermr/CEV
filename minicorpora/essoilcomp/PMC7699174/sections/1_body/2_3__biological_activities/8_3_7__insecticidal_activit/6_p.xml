<p>Compound 
 <bold>164</bold> inhibited growth at the larval stage; on day 20, this compound clearly showed a reduction in larval growth, moderate larval mortalities (&lt;37%), and delays in time to pupation were observed in 5 ppm cedrelanolide-treated males, 50 ppm treated females when compared to the humilinolides from 
 <italic>Swietenia humilis</italic>. Regarding survival to the adult stage, as compared to the pupal stage, compound 
 <bold>164</bold> presented no further reductions. The authors affirmed that, similar to other limonoids, the reduction in insect growth from compound 
 <bold>164</bold> and other limonoids evaluated can be associated with a combination of antifeedant action and post-digestive toxicity.
