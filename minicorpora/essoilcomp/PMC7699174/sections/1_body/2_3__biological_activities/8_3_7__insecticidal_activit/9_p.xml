<p>At the larval stage, all tested compounds at 52 ppm, except cedrelanolide, inhibited growth. At lower concentrations, only compounds 
 <bold>177a</bold> and 
 <bold>178a</bold> showed higher insecticidal activity, with 83.3% larval mortality at 10 ppm. After 21 days, it was observed that compound 
 <bold>181</bold> showed better results than the positive control, toosendanin, at 5 ppm.
