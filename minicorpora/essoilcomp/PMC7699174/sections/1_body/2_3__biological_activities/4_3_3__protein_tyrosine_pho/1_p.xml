<p>The potential of compounds

 <italic>C. odorata</italic> twigs and leaves [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-25-05401" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] for the inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) was evaluated through a bioassay according to Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="B89-molecules-25-05401" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. These compounds (
 <bold>136</bold> IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 13.09 µg/mL; 
 <bold>137</bold> IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 3.93 µg/mL) presented significant PTP1B inhibition potential. PTP1B is an important therapeutic target of some metabolic disorders such as diabetes and obesity, and assays performed by Elchebly et al. [
 <xref rid="B90-molecules-25-05401" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] with PTP1B-deficient mice showed enhanced insulin sensitivity and resistance to diet-induced obesity.
