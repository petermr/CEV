<p>Although some compounds (
 <bold>6</bold>, 
 <bold>120</bold>, and 
 <bold>121</bold>) were isolated from the most active extract, the oxidant potential was not tested for these compounds. Nevertheless, the authors carried out an investigation on the presence of phytochemicals in the solvent extracts of 
 <italic>C. odorata</italic> stems as a reasoned justification for active extracts. Therefore, flavonoids, steroids, and triterpenes were detected, compounds with good antioxidant effects that could be due to the hydroxyl groups present in the compounds found and which were present in ample amounts in the extract.
