<p>Solvent extracts of 
 <italic>C. odorata</italic> stems were tested for free radical scavenging activity in a model reaction with stable 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) by Rashed [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-05401" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], according to a standard protocol by Saha et al. [
 <xref rid="B85-molecules-25-05401" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. The dichloromethane extract presented better activity than other solvent extracts tested (85.45% DPPH free radical scavenging effect).
