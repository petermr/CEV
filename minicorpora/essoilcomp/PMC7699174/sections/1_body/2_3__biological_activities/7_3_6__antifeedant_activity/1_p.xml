 <bold>207</bold> were isolated from 
 <italic>C. odorata</italic> stem bark, and their antifeedant activity briefly tested against the third-instar larvae of 
 <italic>Spodoptera littoralis</italic> (Boisd.) by Kipassa et al. [
 <xref rid="B65-molecules-25-05401" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] with Wada and Munakata’s [
 <xref rid="B94-molecules-25-05401" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>] test methodology. Only limonoid 
 <bold>203</bold>, mexicanolide type, was active at the 500 ppm concentration. The authors point out that at a 1000 ppm concentration, the obacunol type (
 <bold>170</bold>–
 <bold>175</bold>) showed weak activity while other mexicanolide (
 <bold>199</bold> and 
 <bold>203–207</bold>) types showed moderate activities.
