<p>Still considering the anti-cancer activity, in 2018, Wan et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-05401" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] investigated, through a number of bioassays, the action mechanism of the anti-cancer effect of compound 
 <bold>127</bold>, being known that this compound demonstrates oxidant potential, being able to interrupt the cell cycle of cancer cell lines MCF-7, NCI-H460, and A375-C5 [
 <xref rid="B87-molecules-25-05401" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Nonetheless, it is not known if compound 
 <bold>127</bold>, as well as other limonoids, could cause autophagy and other cellular responses in carcinoma cells.
