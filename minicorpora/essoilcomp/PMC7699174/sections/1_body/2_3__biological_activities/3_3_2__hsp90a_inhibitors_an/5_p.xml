<p>Based on the possibility of compounds 
 <bold>211</bold>, 
 <bold>213</bold>, and 
 <bold>215</bold> interacting with Hsp90, inhibiting its activity, the cytotoxic activity of these compounds was assessed against epithelial carcinoma cell lines (human HeLa) and breast carcinoma cell lines (MCF-7) by Microculture of Tetrazolium (MTT) proliferation assay. Results showed that for the two cell lines tested, compound 
 <bold>211</bold> inhibited cell proliferation (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 10.1 ± 0.2 µM in HeLa and 51.3 ± 0.3 µM in MCF-7 cells), in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas compounds 
 <bold>213</bold> and 
 <bold>215</bold> showed no significant results (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 100 µM for two compounds in both cell lines).
