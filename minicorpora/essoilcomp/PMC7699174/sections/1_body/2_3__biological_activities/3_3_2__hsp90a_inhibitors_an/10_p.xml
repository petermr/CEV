<p>The effect of compound 
 <bold>127</bold> in vivo was also tested against MKN45 cell xenograft tumors and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumor models. This compound was able to inhibit tumor growth, where BALB/C nude mice did not present toxic syndromes, diminished activity, or death, and there were no dramatic changes in body weight with either tumor model. Moreover, and very importantly, the Ki67 expression was inhibited, which indicated that the tumor proliferation was inhibited.
