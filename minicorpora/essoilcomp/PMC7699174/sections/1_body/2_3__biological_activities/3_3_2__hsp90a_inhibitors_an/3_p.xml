<p>Comparing the thermodynamic (

 <sub>D</sub>) and kinetic constant (dissociation—
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>d</sub> and association—
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>a</sub>) values for these three compounds, the authors suggest that they could interact with the protein from a different approach. Thus was suggested because compound 
 <bold>213</bold> presented a low 
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>d</sub> value, whereas compounds 
 <bold>211</bold> and 
 <bold>215</bold> presented better 
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>a</sub> values and was confirmed when the limited proteolysis-mass spectrometry-based approach was performed, making it possible to lift and confirm the hypothesis that compounds 
 <bold>211</bold> and 
 <bold>215</bold> prevented the proteolytic digestion of Hsp90a at Lys564 and Lys614, which are two residues located in the protein C-terminal; C-terminal being the point of interaction of these compounds with Hsp90.
