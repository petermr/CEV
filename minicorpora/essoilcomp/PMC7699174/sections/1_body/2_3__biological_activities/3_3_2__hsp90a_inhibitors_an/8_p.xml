<p>Furthermore, it was noted that compound 
 <bold>127</bold> induced the accumulation of excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can give rise to other molecular responses such as autophagy. This was observed as compound 
 <bold>127</bold> increased autophagy marker levels early and provoked the conversion of Light Chain 3 (LC3) -I to LC3-II, which directly indicates autophagy. Adding these results to those observed in flow cytometry, the authors suggested that compound 
 <bold>127</bold> induced autophagy.
