<p>Compound 
 <bold>127</bold>, isolated from 
 <italic>C. odorata</italic>, inhibited cell growth in a time-dependent and concentration-dependent manner by induced cell death, which could have been due to apoptosis or autophagy. Flow cytometry results presented little or no apoptosis in the tested concentrations (8 µM, 16 µM, and 32 µM), showing that this is not the reason for the inhibition of cell proliferation.
