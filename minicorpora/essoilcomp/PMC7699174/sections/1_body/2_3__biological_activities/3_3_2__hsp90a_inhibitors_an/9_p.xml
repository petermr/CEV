<p>With the purpose of evaluating the anti-cancer capacity of compound 
 <bold>127</bold>, Wan et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-05401" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] verified through western blot assay based on Lu et al. [
 <xref rid="B88-molecules-25-05401" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] the regulatory roles of compound 
 <bold>127</bold> in ROS/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways and effects of these on the autophagy, migration, and invasion. N-acetyl-
 <sc>l</sc>-cysteine (NAC) was used as a ROS remover was able to suppress ROS production, and the role of compound 
 <bold>127</bold> in MEK/ERK signaling. On the other hand, U0126 used as a MEK/ERK inhibitor did not inhibit ROS production, although a decrease in MEK/ERK activity was observed. Thus, it was possible to identify that compound 
 <bold>127</bold> activated the MEK/ERK signaling, playing a crucial role.
