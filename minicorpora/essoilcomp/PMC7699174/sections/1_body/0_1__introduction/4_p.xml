<p>According to some authors, the affiliation of 
 <italic>Toona</italic> to Swietenioideae is rather problematic, precisely because in terms of secondary metabolites, mexicanolide type limonoids, characteristic to Swietenioideae, are not present in 
 <italic>Toona</italic> [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-05401" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-05401" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-05401" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Thus, it could not be included in this subfamily with 
 <italic>Cedrela</italic> genus, while another affirmation is that morphological aspects justify the junction of these genera by Harms [
