<p>Knowledge of the chemical compounds and, mainly, limonoids present in 
 <italic>Cedrela</italic> is important to differentiate 
 <italic>Cedrela</italic> and 
 <italic>Toona</italic> (Endl.) M. Roem. species, considering that both genera are part of a chemotaxonomic discussion, based on the inclusion of these genera in the Cedreleae tribe within Cedreloideae by Harms [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-05401" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and in the Cedreleae tribe under Swietenioidae subfamily by Pennignton and Styles [
