<p>Meliaceae trees are known as an excellent hardwood, prized for their wood quality, besides having considerable economic value, for example, cedar (
 <italic>Cedrela</italic>) and mahogany (
 <italic>Swietenia</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Khaya</italic> spp.) [

 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-05401" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. As a result, plants of this genus have experienced overexploitation, leading to three species being added to the Official National List of Flora Species Endangered by Decree No. 443 of the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment on 17 December 2014 [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-05401" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In this decree, 
 <italic>Cedrela fissilis</italic> Vell. and 
 <italic>Cedrela odorata</italic> L. were considered vulnerable species (VU), and 
 <italic>C. angustifolia</italic> DC. an endangered species (EN). Furthermore, these species were also added to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of threatened species. Therefore, several recent studies, mainly in biotechnology, have focused on sustainable production and the use of 
 <italic>Cedrela</italic> in forest cultivation. Moreover, there are recommendations for the broadening of national and international legislation to protect 
 <italic>Cedrela</italic> species [
