<p>Limonoids are a group of modified triterpenes, also known as tetranortriterpenoids. This class of compounds has highly oxygenated structures, derived from a precursor with a 4,4,8-trimethyl-17-furanylsteroid skeleton that is biosynthesized by the acetate-mevalonate pathway [

It is worth mentioning that limonoids can also be found in Rutaceae, Cneoraceae, Ptaeroxylaceae, and Simaroubaceae families; however, they are especially abundant and structurally diversified in the Meliaceae family [
