<p>This article presents 215 chemical compounds, including chemical structures, found in quali or quantitative phytochemical studies on 
 <italic>Cedrela</italic> species from early 1960 to 2020. It was possible to observe that of 18 species, the most commonly studied species was 
 <italic>C. odorata</italic> L.; however, other species such as 
 <italic>C. fissilis</italic> Vell., 
 <italic>C. salvadorensis</italic> Standl., 
 <italic>C. dugesii</italic> S. Watson, 
 <italic>C. montana</italic> Moritz ex Turcz., 
 <italic>C. angustifolia</italic> DC. and 
 <italic>C. oaxacensis</italic> C.DC. and Rose were also studied. It can also be noted that there are few studies about it; thus, these species and species that still remain unresearched should be considered in further phytochemical and pharmacological studies, which may be a promising direction in the search for new compounds with pharmacological properties.
