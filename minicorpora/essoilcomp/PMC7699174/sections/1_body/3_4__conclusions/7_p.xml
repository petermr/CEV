<p>In the case of activities related to human health, promising results were achieved in the antitripanocidal activity of compound 
 <bold>127</bold> and in the antimalarial activity of compound 
 <bold>181</bold>. Although these results are interesting, more studies must be conducted in order to describe the real efficacy, besides continuing the pharmacological studies. These can be interpreted because of the concentration of these compounds in the botanical parts or in the species, therefore phytochemical studies that use validated analytical methods, or in vitro culturing, aimed at obtaining these secondary metabolites in a sustainable way are required.
