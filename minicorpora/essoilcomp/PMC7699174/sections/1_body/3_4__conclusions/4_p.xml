<p>As limonoids are a characteristic class of the Meliaceae family, these compounds found in 
 <italic>Cedrela</italic> species were classified based on Fang et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-05401" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="molecules-25-05401-sch003">Scheme 3</xref> shows the classes and types of limonoids found in the genus 
 <italic>Cedrela</italic>. As depicted, B,D-seco was the main class found, with 25 limonoids, most of them mexicanolide type (22). Other limonoid types were also found but in much smaller quantities, such as gedunine (9), obacul (7), neotecleanin (5), evodulone (1), delevoyin (1), havenensin (4), and andirobin (3). One degraded limonoid was also found; nonetheless, Fang et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-05401" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] did not relate this limonoid type to any class. These authors suggest that this type could be the origin of degradation of intact limonoids since it possesses a furan ring and the C and D ring portions of the original limonoids.
