<p>When Damask rose flower buds began to open in May 2019, flowers (petals and sepals) were randomly collected from different bushes (100 bushes at each crop site) at 6 a.m. The samples were transferred to the laboratory and kept for an hour at 4Â°C. A complete bush was also collected from each field, identified at the herbarium of the School of Natural Resources and Earth Sciences in Kashan University, coded and stored.</p>
