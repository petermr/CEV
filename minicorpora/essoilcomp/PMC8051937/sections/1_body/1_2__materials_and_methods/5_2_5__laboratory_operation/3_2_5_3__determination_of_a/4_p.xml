<p>The agar dilution assay was used to determine the MICs for the fungal strains based on the protocol introduced by of [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The suitable amounts of EO at different concentrations (2000, 1000, 500, 250, 125, 62.5, 31.25 and 15.63 μg/mL) were added to SDA containing 50% (v/v) Tween 20. Nystatin powder was used as the positive control, and the negative control was the plate with SDA containing 50% (v/v) Tween 20 without any EO. The culture media were spot inoculated with 4 ml of spores (10
 <sup>4</sup> spores /mL). The inoculated plates were incubated at 30°C for 72 h, the test was performed in triplicate for each essential oil, and the minimal concentration of the essential oil that inhibited the growth of the fungi was reported as the MIC.
