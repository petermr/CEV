 <italic>MIC</italic>. To determine the MICs for the bacterial and yeast strains, sterile 96-well microtiter plates and the broth microdilution method were used according to the CLSI protocol [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Various dilutions of the EO were prepared first. A certain volume of the EO was weighed, dissolved in the culture medium and DMSO at a suitable ratio to prepare the initial stock at a concentration of 2000 μg/mL. This stock was used to prepare the 1000, 500, 250, 125, 62.5, 31.25, and 15.63 μg/mL dilutions. Each well in the microplate was filled with 200 μL of a solution containing 95 μL of brain heart infusion (BHI) broth for bacteria or with 95 μL of SD broth for yeast, and 5 μL of the microbial suspension with the turbidity adjusted to that of a 0.5 McFarland standard and 100 μL of one of the EO dilutions were added. The wells intended as negative controls were filled with the culture medium instead of the essential oil and for the wells intended as positive controls antibiotic powders (gentamicin and rifampin) were used instead of the EO for the bacterial strains and nystatin powder for the yeast. Plates inoculated with bacterial and fungal plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h and at 30°C for 48 h, respectively. MIC was determined taking into account the turbidity and the change in the color in each well of the microplate. The test was performed in triplicate for each EO sample and the mean was reported as the minimum concentration of the EO that inhibited the growth of bacteria or yeast.
