 <italic>Agar well-diffusion method</italic>. The protocol of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] was employed in using this method. Plates containing Mueller-Hinton agar and SDA were first prepared to culture the bacterial and fungal strains, respectively. The EO was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and the concentration was raised to 300 μg/mL. The turbidity of each microbial suspension (100 μL) was adjusted to that of a 0.5 McFarland standard and the suspensions were cultured on the culture media under identical conditions. A number of wells with 6 mm diameter and 4 mm thickness were made in the culture plates and 10 μL EO (at concentration 300μg/mL) was added to each well. The plates were kept at 4°C for 2 h. The plates inoculated with the bacterial strains were then incubated at 37°C for 24 h and those incubated with the

 <italic>albicans</italic> ATCC 10231 were incubated at 30°C for 72 and 48 hours, respectively. Gentamicin (10 μg/disc) and rifampin (5μg/disc) were used as positive controls for the bacterial strains and nystatin (100,000 units/mL) as the positive control for the fungal strains under the same conditions as those for the EO tests. IZD was measured using a ruler (that measures in millimeters) to generate the antibiogram. The test was performed in triplicate for each EO to assess reproducibility and become certain of the reliability of the results. The IZDs were reported as mean ± SD.
