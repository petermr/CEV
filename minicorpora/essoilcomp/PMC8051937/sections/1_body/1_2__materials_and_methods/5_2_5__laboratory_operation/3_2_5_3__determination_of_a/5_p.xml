 <italic>MBC</italic>. The broth microdilution method based on CLSI protocol (2012) was used as described above to determine MBC. Following 24 h of incubation, the nutrient agar medium was inoculated with 5 μL of each well that exhibited no trace of bacterial growth (light well) and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. MBC refers to the minimal concentration of the EO that kills 99.9% of the inoculated bacteria.
