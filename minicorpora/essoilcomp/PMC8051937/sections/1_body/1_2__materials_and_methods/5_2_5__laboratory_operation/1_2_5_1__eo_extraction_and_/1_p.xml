<p>To extract the EO, fresh flowers (350 g) were collected from each harvesting point at each crop site, weighed and put into a two-liter flask. The EO was extracted by distilled water using a Clevenger-type apparatus for 5 h. The extract was dehydrated using sodium sulfate, separated, and kept in the dark in a dark-colored bottle at 4°C until later use. The EO yield for each harvesting point was expressed based on weight/weight percent (% w/w) at each site. The EO yield for each site was reported as the mean± SD of three replications (harvesting points).</p>
