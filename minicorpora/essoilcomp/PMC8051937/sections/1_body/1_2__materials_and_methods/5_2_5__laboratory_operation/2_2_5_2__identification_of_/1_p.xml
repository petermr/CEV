<p>A GC-MS instrument was employed to determine the chemical composition of the EO samples. The instrument consisted of a 6890 gas chromatograph (GC) coupled to an Agilent 5973 N mass spectrometer (MS) with a capillary column of HP-5 MS and 5% methyl phenyl of the stagnant phase (30 m length, 0.25 mm internal diameter, the thickness of stagnant layer 0.25 Î¼m) and the ionization energy of 70 eV.</p>
