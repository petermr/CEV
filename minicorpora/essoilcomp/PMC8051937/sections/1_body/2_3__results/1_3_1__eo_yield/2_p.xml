 <xref rid="pone.0249363.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> shows the results related to correlations between soil characteristics and EO yield. There were direct correlations between EO yield and soil EC and percentages of its sand, gypsum and lime contents and inverse correlations between EO yield and soil silt and clay percentages. The highest values of EC (~4.817 ds/m), sand percentage (~82.000%) and gypsum content (~0.703%) belonged to EO
 <sub>N</sub> and the highest values of clay percentage (~11.667%) and silt percentage (~18.67%) were those of EO
 <sub>Y</sub> (
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Therefore, lighter soil texture, higher EC (salinity), and higher gypsum and lime contents probably increased EO yield. The plants growing in soils with higher clay percentage must spend more energy for root growth and water and nutrient absorption and hence plant growth and yield decrease. [
