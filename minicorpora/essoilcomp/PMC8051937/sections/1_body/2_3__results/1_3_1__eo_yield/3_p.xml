<p>Assessment of irrigation water characteristics showed higher concentrations of all cations and anions, water-soluble salts and consequently higher EC, sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and soluble sodium percentage (SSP) at the Noushabad site, which could be among the reasons for its higher EO yield. However, [

 <italic>Melissa officinalis</italic> L., respectively. These conflicting results regarding the effect of salinity on EO yield of various species in previous research might be due to genotype differences (sensitivity to salinity and halophilism), growing conditions and cultivation techniques [

High magnesium concentrations in irrigation water may cause production of secondary metabolites to start thereby increasing EO yield [
