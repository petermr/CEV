<p>Another considerable activity of the Damask rose EOs was the antibacterial activity of EO
 <sub>S</sub> against the Gram-positive 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MIC = 31.25 μg/mL and MBC = 62.5 μg/mL). It was as effective against this bacterial species as rifampin (MIC = 31.25 μg/mL). This finding is not consistent with those of the research by [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] in Bulgaria (MIC = 60 μg/mL) and [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] in China (MIC = 250 μg/mL) for Musk rose EO. [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] confirmed the inhibitory and lethal effects of linalool, phenylethyl alcohol, citronellol, geraniol, farnesol, and methyl eugenol derived from Musk rose EO against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. Farnesol showed the lowest MIC and MBC values (MIC = 31.25 μg/mL and MBC = 62.5 μg/mL). The contents of these compounds were much lower in EO
 <sub>S</sub> than in EO
 <sub>N</sub> and EO
 <sub>Y</sub>. Therefore, antibacterial activity of EO
 <sub>S</sub> against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> might be due to higher amounts of alkanes that compensated for lower quantities of the above-mentioned compounds whereas EO
 <sub>N</sub> and EO
 <sub>Y</sub> had low quantities of alkanes and hence lower antibacterial activity.
