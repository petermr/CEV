<p>Antifungal and antibacterial activities of Damask rose EO against different strains were assessed using the agar well-diffusion method (
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0249363.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Inhibition zones (IZs) were only observed for Gram-positive 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus brasiliensis</italic>. ANOVA results showed that crop site had a significant effect on IZD of Damask rose EO against 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus brasiliensis</italic> (P≤ 0.01) (
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.t009" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>). [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>] assessed the effect of crop site on IZs of 
 <italic>Tagetes minuta</italic> L. EO against different microbial strains using the agar well-diffusion method. The largest IZD of rose EO against 
 <italic>Aspergillus brasiliensis</italic> (~14.67 mm) belonged to the Sefidshahr site, that exhibited relatively potent antifungal activity (~30 mm) compared to nystatin. These results are consistent with those of the study by [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>] who determined antifungal activity of Damask rose EO extracted in Isfahan against 
 <italic>Aspergillus brasiliensis</italic>. Variations in antimicrobial activities of EOs of a species grown in different regions may result from differences in the dominant compounds found in the Eos and the presence of different chemicals in the EOs [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Dominance of alkanes (especially nonadecane and heneicosane) in EO
 <sub>S</sub> can be one of the reasons for antifungal activity. Not only dominant and main compounds in EOs but also the synergistic effects of those compounds with lower percentages may contribute to their antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Therefore, the low contents of trans-rose oxide and sesquiterpenes (e.g., germacrene D, caryophyllene, α-guaiene, α-humulene and δ-guaiene) in EO
 <sub>S</sub>, which were higher compared to the other two sites, can probably be among the other factors influencing this antifungal activity. The effects of abundance of sesquiterpenes against different microbial strains were recorded by [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] who showed that antifungal activity of Eos obtained from Phlomis species. It is noteworthy that the value of MBC and MIC obtained for this fungus was 1000 μg/mL, which is much higher than that of nystatin (31.2 μg/mL) (
