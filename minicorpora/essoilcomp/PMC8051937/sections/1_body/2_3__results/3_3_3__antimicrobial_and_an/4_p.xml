<p>The studied EOs only exhibited identical MIC value (MIC = 125 μg/mL) against the Gram-negative species

 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] attributed the inhibitory and lethal effects against 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>coli</italic> to the presence of linalool, phenyl alcohol, β-citronellol, geraniol, eugenol, an methyl eugenol, with β-citronellol and geraniol showing the strongest antibacterial activity against this this bacterial species (MBC = 125 μg/mL and MIC = 62.5 μg/mL). Therefore, all the above compounds derived from the studied EOs, except for phenylethyl alcohol, were present at all three sites in different quantities and could be responsible for the antibacterial activity of the EOs.
