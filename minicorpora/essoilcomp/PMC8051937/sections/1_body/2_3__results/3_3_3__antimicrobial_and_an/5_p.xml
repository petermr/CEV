<p>EO
 <sub>S</sub> at low amounts exhibited antibacterial activity against the other studied strains including those of the Gram-positive 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> and 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and the Gram-negative 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>Salmonella paratyphi</italic>-A serotype, showing the remarkable effects of its content of alkanes in this activity. MIC values of EO
 <sub>S</sub> were lower than EO

 <sub>N</sub> was less potent than EO
 <sub>S</sub> and EO
 <sub>Y</sub>. The MIC and MBC values of EO
