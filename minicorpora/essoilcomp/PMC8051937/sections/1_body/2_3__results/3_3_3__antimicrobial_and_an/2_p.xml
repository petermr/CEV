<p>The IZDs of EO
 <sub>S</sub> and EO
 <sub>Y</sub> for the Gram-positive species 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> was ~11.67 mm, which was relatively good compared to those of rifampin (~21 mm) and gentamicin (~32 mm). The findings also indicated that the MIC and MBC values of EO
 <sub>S</sub> and EO
 <sub>Y</sub> for 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> were &lt;15.63 μg/mL, which were considerably higher than those of rifampin (0.975 μg/mL) and gentamicin (0.975 μg/mL). The EO
 <sub>S</sub> and EO
 <sub>Y</sub> also exhibited potent antibacterial activity against the Gram-negative species 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (MIC = 31.25 μg/mL) compared to rifampin (31.25 μg/mL) and relatively good activity compared to gentamicin (7.81 μg/mL). However, EO
 <sub>N</sub> exhibited much weaker antibacterial activity (MIC = 62.5 μg/mL). [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] showed that Damask rose EO had no antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. These findings are consistent with the results of the present research. Similar antibacterial activities of EO
 <sub>S</sub> and EO
 <sub>Y</sub> seem to be due to their similar chemical profiles, especially with respect to sesquiterpene hydrocarbons. Caryophyllene was observed in EO
 <sub>S</sub> and EO
 <sub>Y</sub>, but was not found in EO
 <sub>N</sub>. Moreover, given the same antibacterial properties of the two Eos, we can infer that the various relative contents of the compounds in their Eos were the reason for their identical antibacterial activities. Dominance of citronellol, geraniol, neral, and eugenol the unique presence of linalool and farnesol isomers in EO
 <sub>Y</sub>, can be the most effective factors responsible for its antimicrobial activity. Antimicrobial activities of these compounds against various microbial strains were confirmed in different studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Conversely, dominance of alkanes (e.g., nonadecane and heneicosane, 1-nonadecene, and eicosane) and higher quantities of sesquiterpenes in Eos can be effective factors responsible for the antimicrobial activity of this EO. Many studies have confirmed the strong antimicrobial effects of alkanes and sesquiterpenes [

 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Diversity in chemical composition of EOs lead to different main activities in relation to possible antimicrobial activities of plant EOs including disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane that disrupt the driving force of protons, electron flow, active transport, and also coagulation of cell contents [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Although Musk rose EO from all the studied sites did not create effective inhibition zones against the bacterial and yeast strains, their various concentrations were effective in inhibiting and killing them. Their MBC and MIC values against some strains were considerable compared to those of the studied antibiotics. EO
 <sub>Y</sub> exhibited the strongest inhibitory and lethal activity against 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (MIC and MBC &lt;15.63 μg/mL), very considerable and significant compared to those for nystatin (125 μg / mL). It was six times more effective than nystatin. These findings are not consistent with the findings of [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] in Bulgaria. Although the MIC and MBC values for EO
 <sub>S</sub> (62.5 μg/mL) and EO
 <sub>N</sub> (250 μg/mL) against 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>albicans</italic> were higher than those of EO
 <sub>Y</sub>, they were found to be more potent than nystatin. The high potency of EO
 <sub>Y</sub> against 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>albicans</italic> is probably due to the presence of citronellol, geraniol, neral, eugenol, linalool, and farnesol isomers compared to EO
 <sub>S</sub> and EO
 <sub>N</sub>. Citronellol [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>], geraniol [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>] and farnesol [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>] were found to be effective against 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species. Lower potency of EO
 <sub>N</sub> compared to EO
 <sub>Y</sub> against 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>albicans</italic> can be due to lower quantities or the absence of these compounds. However, the low amounts of these compounds in EO
 <sub>S</sub> were probably compensated for by the high quantities of alkanes and sesquiterpenes in this EO, which enabled EO
 <sub>S</sub> to inhibit and kill 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>albicans</italic> at a lower MIC value compared to EO
 <sub>N</sub>.
