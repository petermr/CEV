<p>Phenylethyl alcohol is responsible for aroma of flowers in the Rosaceae family. It is one of the major constituents of Damask rose EO [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. It is highly soluble in water and completely vaporizes in the distillation process. Low contents of this compound are found in rose EO [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. There were significant differences between the studied sites in the content of this material. The highest content (1.50%) was recorded at the Noushabad site. No trace of this compound was found at the Sefidshahr site. [

 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] in southern Iran did not find this compound in Damask rose EO either. The highest content of this compound (0.86%) was found in northern Iran and Bulgaria (27.75%). These results are not consistent with those of the present research [

 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Correlations of soil characteristics with this compound were studied. The results indicated increased synthesis of this compound with decreases in soil pH and nitrogen, organic carbon, lime, potassium, phosphorus contents and also with increases in soil potassium and phosphorous contents. These results are similar to those concerning correlations between citronellol content and soil characteristics. Synthesis of the compounds responsible for the aroma of
