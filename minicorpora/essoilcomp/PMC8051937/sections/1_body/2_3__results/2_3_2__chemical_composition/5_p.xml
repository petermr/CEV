<p>Nonadecane and heneicosane alkanes were among the most abundant compounds in Damask rose EO at all three studied sites. ANOVA results showed the significant effect of crop site on nonadecane and heneicosane quantities (Pâ‰¤ 0.01) (

 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] in China also recorded these two compounds as the major constituents of Damask rose EO. Correlations of these two compounds with soil characteristics were assessed. The results showed that there were strong and indirect correlations between the contents of these two compounds and soil phosphorous and potassium contents and strong positive correlations between their contents and soil nitrogen, lime and organic carbon contents. Soil acidity had a significant direct correlation with the quantity of nonadecane at the 5% significance level (
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). High organic carbon content of the soil leads to desirable water retention that enhances root growth, and the gradual release of nitrogen increases its uptake. Nitrogen increases the growing period, plant dry materials, and photosynthesis, prepares the carbon skeleton and substrate necessary for biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and hence increases the materials that form them [

Comparison of the correlations between nonadecane and citronellol and soil characteristics showed that the same factors increasing citronellol synthesis reduced nonadecane synthesis. Moreover, soil characteristics, except for acidity, inversely affected the amounts of heneicosane and citronellol. Therefore, crop sites with suitable soil and water characteristics for the synthesis of these alkanes lack the appropriate conditions for the synthesis of the important compounds citronellol and geraniol. In fact, plants that are grown in soils with higher lime, nitrogen and organic carbon contents and lower phosphorus and potassium contents and are irrigated with water containing lower bicarbonate levels produce EO having poorer EO aroma quality and lower amounts of alkanes.
