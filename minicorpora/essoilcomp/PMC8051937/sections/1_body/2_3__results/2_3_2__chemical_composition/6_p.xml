<p>Eugenol and neral are important compounds in Damask rose EO. ANOVA results showed that crop site had a significant effect on the quantities of these two compounds (P≤ 0.01) (
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), and their highest amounts (1.32–2.40%) were recorded at the Yazdel site. Previous studies did not report presence of eugenol in the chemical composition of Damask rose EO in northern Iran, but [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] found a very low amount of eugenol (0.18%) in Damask rose EO extracted in that region. These results are not consistent with those of the present research, and neral was not found in the EO

 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] in southern Iran did not find this compound in the chemical composition of Damask rose EO either. The highest content of this compound (9.6%) has been recorded in India) [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Correlations between soil characteristics and the quantities of eugenol and neral were studied. The results indicated that there was a strong and positive correlation between soil phosphorus and silt percentage and the contents of these two compounds and a negative correlation between soil lime content and sand percentage and the amounts of eugenol and neral. It seems that, except for EC, the same factors affect the synthesis of these two compounds and geraniol. The trend of changes in the amounts of eugenol and neral was similar to that of geraniol. It was mainly the Sefidshahr site that did not possess the required conditions for the synthesis of these compounds.
