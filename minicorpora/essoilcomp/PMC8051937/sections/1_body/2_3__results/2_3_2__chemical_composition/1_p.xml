<p>The chemical analysis of the EOs identified 52 compounds that constituted 99.58â€“97.99% of them at the three crop sites (
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>). The lowest number of compounds (27) was that of the EO
 <sub>S</sub>, which was significantly different from that recorded for EO
 <sub>Y</sub> and EO
 <sub>N</sub> (39 compounds). [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] also reported different numbers of compounds derived from Damask rose EO in various regions in Iran. Differences in the types and numbers of compounds might result from genetic variations or from environmental factors including soil chemical composition [

 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Soil chemical composition affects not only the amounts of EOs but also the distribution of the chemotypes and the percentages of the compounds found in EOs because chemical elements enter into the composition of the enzymes that are involved in plant biochemical processes [

 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Nonterpenoids (others) and oxygenated monoterpenes were the major constituents of the EOs at all the studied sites. These results are consistent with those of the study by [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The highest percentages of nonterpenoids (39.27%) and oxygenated monoterpenes (68.15%) were obtained from EO
 <sub>S</sub> and EO
 <sub>Y</sub>, respectively.
