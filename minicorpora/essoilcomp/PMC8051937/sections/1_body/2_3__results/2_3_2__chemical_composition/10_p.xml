<p>Rose oxide is also one of the effective compounds in the flavor of Damask rose EO. Even low amounts of this compound have a substantial effect on aroma and flavor of this EO. Trans-rose oxide quantities varied at the studied sites. Its highest amount (1.30%) was recorded at the Sefidshahr site, but no trace of it was found at the Yazdel site. [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] reported only low contents of rose oxide (0.1%) from northern Iran. These results were not consistent with those of the present research. There were direct correlations between rose oxide content and soil lime and organic contents and sand percentage and inverse correlations between its quantity and soil phosphorous content and silt percentage. It seems that it is necessary to increase the factors reducing the contents of the other compounds responsible for the aroma of Damask rose EO in order to increase the quantity of rose oxide in it. This will considerably influence the low quality of Damask rose EO.
