<p>The citronellol-geraniol (C/G) ratio has been used in many studies to assess the aroma quality of Damask rose EO [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], which is dependent on the climatic and geographical origins of the plant [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. The best aroma is produced when the C/G ratio is between 1.25 and 1.30 [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. The C/G ratio varied at the studied sites (CG&lt;17.65 in Noushabad, CG&lt;15.85 in Sefidshahr and CG&lt;4.24 in Yazdel). These values indicate the high-quality aroma of EO
