<p>Linalool and farnesol have important therapeutic effects, especially antimicrobial activity. Low contents of linalool and farnesol isomers in EO
 <sub>Y</sub> are among the other advantages of this EO that are consistent with the findings of [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. There was a strong direct correlation between silt percentage and phosphorus content and the contents of linalool and farnesol isomers (cis-farnesol, trans-farnesol and trans,trans-farnesol). Strong indirect correlations were also found between the contents of these materials and soil EC, lime content and sand percentage. These results completely match the correlations between geraniol and soil characteristics (
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Therefore, heavy-textured saline soils with high lime and phosphorous contents will substantially help synthesis of this type of compounds in Damask rose EO. [
