<p>Citronellol and geraniol are the most important constituents of Damask rose EO and the main components responsible for its aroma quality [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. The results showed the significant effect of crop site on citronellol percentage at the 1% significance level (
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] also showed that crop site had no significant effect (p&lt; 0.05) on carvacrol content in the species 
 <italic>Satureja rechingeri</italic> Jamzad and 
 <italic>Satureja khuzestanica</italic> Jamzad. These results are not consistent with those of the present study. The highest percentages of citronellol and geraniol belonged to the Yazdel site (~29.05% and ~6.85%). The differences in the percentages of these compounds at the sites are consistent with the results of the study by [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] in Iran but not with those in the studies by [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] in the western Himalayas (citronellol = 42.0% and geraniol = 21.4%) and [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] in Turkey (citronellol = 35.23% and geraniol = 22.19). Results related to correlation of soil characteristics with citronellol content showed that there were direct correlations between the amount of citronellol and soil potassium and phosphorus contents and inverse correlations between the quantity of citronellol and soil acidity and soil lime, nitrogen and organic carbon contents. Potassium plays a role in almost all plant metabolic processes the most important of which are its effects on growth, enzyme activation, and prevention of energy loss [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Potassium seems to be involved in the chemical structure and activation of the enzymes affecting biochemical pathways related to synthesis of active plant ingredients [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Phosphorus is one of the macro nutrients and significantly contributes to plant growth and EO biosynthesis. It is involved in photosynthesis, respiration and pyruvate production (a necessary compound for EO biosynthesis), and is present in the structures of the three coenzymes adenosine triphosphate (ATP), coenzyme A and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) that take part in biosynthesis of terpenoids [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Soil phosphorus available to plants may be converted to calcium phosphate (unavailable to plants) under the influence of calcium carbonate in calcareous and alkaline soils of arid and semi-arid regions [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Therefore, reducing soil lime content can substantially help phosphorous absorption by plants. The Yazdel site had the lowest lime content. There was a direct correlation between geraniol content and soil phosphorous and silt percentage and inverse correlations between geraniol content and soil EC and soil lime and sand percentage (
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Therefore, in addition to the effects of higher phosphorus and lower lime contents on the synthesis of citronellol and geraniol, lower salinity and clay texture could be among the factors that increased geraniol synthesis compared to the other sites. Also [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] showed that increased contents of the dominant compounds such as 1,8-cineole and camphor in the EO of 
 <italic>Achillea millefolium</italic> L. subsp. 
 <italic>millefolium</italic> were correlated with lower soil EC and higher clay percentage. Production of plant secondary metabolites is substantially influenced by environmental conditions, especially biotic and abiotic stresses. Among them, salinity greatly influences plant EO composition and their biosynthesis [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Production of monoterpenes is catalyzed by terpene synthesis, which is guided by stress-related programs. [

 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] determined the effects of higher salinity on the synthesis of the major compounds in the EO, especially monoterpenes, in 
 <italic>Mentha canadensis</italic> L., 
 <italic>Melissa officinalis</italic> L., and 
 <italic>Mentha spicata</italic>, respectively. Their results contradict the findings of the present study. Higher concentrations of bicarbonate in the irrigation water at the Yazdel site and hence the greater inhibitory effect on primary metabolic activities [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>], which leads to synthesis of secondary metabolites, could be another possible factor increasing the contents of citronellol and geraniol.
