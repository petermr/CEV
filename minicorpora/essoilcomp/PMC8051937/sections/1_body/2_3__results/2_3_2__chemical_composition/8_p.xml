<p>Methyl eugenol (ME) is another important compound in Damask rose EO that the crop site significantly influenced (Pâ‰¤ 0.01) (
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). It is a natural carcinogenic phenylpropanoid compound [
 <xref rid="pone.0249363.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Its concentration is carefully scrutinized when selecting the best option in planting Damask rose. The highest and lowest ME concentrations were found at the Noushabad (2.68%) and Yazdel (0.85%) sites. Results of correlations between soil characteristics and ME contents suggested that there were strong positive correlations between ME content and soil EC and sand and gypsum contents and strong inverse correlations between its content and soil pH and silt and clay percentages. [

 <italic>Melissa officinalis</italic> L. These results are consistent with those of the present research. Higher EC values pose major constraints to growth, development, productivity, and crop quality in many regions of the world through disrupting plant physiological functions, but they may stimulate production and accumulation of secondary metabolites in plants [
