<p>The present study showed that yield, chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>damascena</italic> EO were influenced by different soil and irrigation water characteristics at the crop sites. The correlations between EO yield and soil EC and gypsum and lime contents and components of soil texture revealed that 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>damascena</italic> should be planted in light-textured soil profile with high EC and gypsum and lime contents and be irrigated with high-salinity cation- and anion-rich water to produce the highest yield, that Noushabad site had the most suitable conditions for production of highest yield EO (~0.0266%). However, EO
 <sub>Y</sub> with the highest concentrations of geraniol (~29.05%), citronellol (~6.85%), eugenol (~2.40%), neral (~1.32%), and linalool (~1.25%), and having the lowest quantities of alkanes, produced the best quality rose EO with respect to aroma and flavor. High levels of phosphorus and potassium and low EC and low soil lime and nitrogen contents and sand percentage and irrigation with water containing low quantities of magnesium cations were among the most effective factors increasing the amounts of compounds responsible for the quality of the EO. The differences in the chemical composition of the EOs led to various antimicrobial activities against the different microbial strains. In general, the EO
 <sub>S</sub> showed the strongest antimicrobial activity against the microbial strains due to its high contents of alkanes and sesquiterpenes, especially against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MIC = 31.25 μg/mL and MBC = 62.5 μg/mL) and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (MIC = 31.25 μg/mL). Dominance of the compounds producing high-quality flavor and aroma in the EO
 <sub>Y</sub> also led to the strongest inhibitory and lethal effects against 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (MIC and MBC &lt;15.63 μg/mL). In all, EOY is a suitable option for aroma and flavor quality, the EON for yield, and EOS for inhibiting and killing some microbial strains a potentially promising strategy.
