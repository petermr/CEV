 <italic>Mentha</italic> L., belonging to the Labiatae family, is widely distributed and cultivated throughout the world. Because of their high economic value, 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> species have become one of the most important essential oil crops in the world [
 <xref rid="B9-plants-10-00930" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In peppermint, the biosynthesis of monoterpenes though the MEP pathway in plastids involves several characterized enzymes, including geranyl diphosphate synthase large subunit (GPPS-l), geranyl diphosphate synthase small subunit (GPPS-s), limonene synthase (LS), (−)-limonene-3-hydroxylase (L3OH), (−)-trans-Isopiperitenol dehydrogenase (iPD), (−)-isopiperitenone reductase (iPR), (+)-cis-isopulegone isomerase (iPI), (+)-pulegone reductase (PR), menthofuran synthase (MFS), and menthol dehydrogenase (MR). The relevant biosynthetic pathway is well understood, and all of the enzymes involved have been properly characterized [
 <xref rid="B10-plants-10-00930" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Nevertheless, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms has revealed how the effects of the environment on monoterpenes biosynthesis are still unknown. Few transcription factors (TFs) have been reported to regulate monoterpenes biosynthesis. For instance, MsMYB negatively regulates monoterpenes production by binding to the 
 <italic>cis</italic>-element of 
 <italic>MSGPPS.LSU</italic> and suppressing its expression [
 <xref rid="B11-plants-10-00930" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The overexpression of 
 <italic>MsYABBY5</italic> was shown to lead to the increased production of terpenes [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-10-00930" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], but their mechanisms of signaling conduction, and the mechanism of the response of their signaling to environmental factors, were elusive.
