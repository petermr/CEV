<p>Light is one of the most important regulators of plant growth and development. It also has a significant impact on the differential accumulation of isoprenoid-derived metabolites [

 <xref rid="B5-plants-10-00930" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], much less is known about how light regulates secondary metabolite biosynthesis, and about the regulatory mechanisms of monoterpenes biosynthesis. It has been reported that light intensity can alter terpenoids production via the activation of photosensitive enzymes involved in the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway [

 <xref rid="B7-plants-10-00930" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It has also been reported that the key transcription factor in the light signaling pathway, AaHY5, positively regulates the expression of genes involved in the artemisinin biosynthetic pathway [
