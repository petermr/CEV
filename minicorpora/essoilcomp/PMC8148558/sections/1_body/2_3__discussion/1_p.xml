<p>Glandular trichomes, referred to as true cell factories, are able to secrete and store large quantities of specialized metabolites. The monoterpenes of mint essential oil are produced by, and stored in, the peltate glandular trichomes [

 <xref rid="B14-plants-10-00930" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The distribution of peppermint gland initiation reflects the basipetal pattern of leaf maturation: relatively immature regions at the leaf’s base continue to produce oil glands long after gland production has stopped at the leaf’s apex [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-10-00930" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. To accurately determine the densities of mint glandular trichomes under low light conditions, five different areas at the same stage of development, from the basal zone to the top zone of an abaxial leaf, were analyzed. Our results show remarkably reduced densities of peltate glandular trichomes in all five selected leaf zones under low light conditions, which correlates with reduced chemical compound production. The present results suggest that reduced light intensity effects not only peltate glandular trichome density, but also the production and accumulation of essential oil, in

 <italic>Varronia curassavica</italic> Jacq., higher irradiance results in an increased essential oil yield and a higher frequency of glandular trichomes [
 <xref rid="B18-plants-10-00930" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The conclusion is that light density regulates not only the density of mint’s glandular trichomes but also the synthesis of essential oil. However, the molecular mechanisms by which light regulates monoterpenes biosynthesis, as well as the reprogramming of the pathway, are still not fully understood. To study the process in more detail, the mRNA expression patterns under changing light conditions were assessed via transcriptome analysis.
