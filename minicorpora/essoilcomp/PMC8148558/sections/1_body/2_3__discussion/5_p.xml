<p>In conclusion, the results of this study prove the effects of light on the density of peltate glandular trichomes and essential oil production in cornmint. The low light condition reduced the PGT densities in all five different zones, from the bottom to the top of the mint leaves, by half a percent. We observed dramatically decreased total essential oil and menthol levels, and increased proportions of pulegone (from 0.95 to 8.70%) and piperitone (from 1.23 to 28.31%). Downregulated expression levels of menthol synthesis pathway genes McGpps-L, McGpps-s, McLs, McL3OH, MciPD, MciPR, and McPR and the monoterpenes biosynthesis genes, as well as the sesquiterpenoids biosynthesis pathway genes, were observed following darkness treatment, and may explain the reduced levels of essential oil produced via the regulatory mechanisms at the transcription level. The identified DEGs in the light signal transduction pathway, and the light-mediated regulation of transcription factors, could be used as effective strategies to achieve increased essential oil yields in future metabolic engineering studies.</p>
