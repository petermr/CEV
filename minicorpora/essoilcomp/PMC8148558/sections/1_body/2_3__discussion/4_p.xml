<p>We have established strategies to increase the levels of essential oil in peppermint via the overexpression of unique structural genes in the menthol synthesis pathway, or the overexpression of additional genes that encode enzymes involved in the precursor supply pathway for monoterpene biosynthesis [
 <xref rid="B26-plants-10-00930" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Transgenic lines were generated, but few of them improved essential oil yields. The overexpression of transcription factors that target and positively control multiple monoterpene biosynthesis, or the suppression of the expression of negatively controlled TFs, could also each represent metabolic engineering strategies for improving essential oil yields. Previously, researchers have elucidated the regulatory roles of several genes encoding the WRKY [

 <xref rid="B35-plants-10-00930" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The overexpression of SmERF128 increased the expression levels of copalyl diphosphate synthase 1 (SmCPS1), kaurene synthase-like 1 (SmKSL1) and cytochrome P450 monooxygenase [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-10-00930" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The functional study of TFs showed that the regulated monoterpene genes in mint were inadequate. The TFs MsYABBY5 and MsMYB were reported to negatively regulate the production of monoterpenes in spearmint [

 <xref rid="B12-plants-10-00930" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In our transcriptome data, Unigene0018692 was homologous to MsMYB, and was found to be dramatically differently expressed under dark conditions. Interestingly, given that it was regulated by light, the expression pattern of this gene was similar to that of the negatively regulated genes, which were downregulated by dark and upregulated by light (mean RPKM value of 24.78 in control vs. 0.76 under darkness and 5.69 after illumination). These results suggest that other TFs must be more essential in regulating monoterpene gene expression through light signal transduction pathways. Our present work provides a list of candidate genes for further metabolic engineering research and will be helpful in exploring the molecular mechanism of the transcriptional responses of MEP pathway genes to light signals. However, the present RNA-seq results could not determine whether splice variants could vary between the absence and presence light. Full-length transcriptome analyses and more verification research should be carried out in the future.
