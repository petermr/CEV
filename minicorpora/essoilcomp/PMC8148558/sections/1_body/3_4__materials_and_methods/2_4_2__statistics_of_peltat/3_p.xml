<p>GC analyses were carried out using a Trace 1300 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and an electronic pressure control (EPC) injector. GC setting were as follow: inlet 250 °C, the carrier gas was N2 (U) with a split flow 50.0 mL/min and the split ratio was 33:1. Analyses were performed using the following temperature program: oven temperature isotherm at 60 °C for 1 min, from 60 °C to 220 °C at the rate of 3 °C min
