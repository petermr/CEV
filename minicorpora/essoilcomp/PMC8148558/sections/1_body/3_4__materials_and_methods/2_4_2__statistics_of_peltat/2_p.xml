<p>Sampling of volatiles from 0.5 g dry weight leaves were collected by headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME), followed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) determination. The polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) 65 µm fiber (65 µm Carboxen™-PDMS StableFlex, Supelco) was then exposed to the headspace of the sample for 3 min at 60 °C to adsorption. Then volatiles absorbed were desorbed in the injection port of GC at 250 °C for 3 min. Each sample was spiked with 300 ng bornanone internal standard. The analysis was performed in triplicate.</p>
