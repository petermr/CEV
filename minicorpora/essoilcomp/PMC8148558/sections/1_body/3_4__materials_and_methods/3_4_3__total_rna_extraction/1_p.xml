<p>Total RNA from nine samples including three repetition samples of control, 24 h darkness treated and 24 h exposure to light leave materials were isolated using RNA iso Plus reagent Kit (Takara Bio, Dalian, China). First strand cDNA was synthesized using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The cDNA library was constructed and transcriptome sequencing was performed by ORI-GENE Company (Beijing, China). The transcriptome libraries were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeqâ„¢ 4000 (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) at the Gene De novo Institute (Guangzhou, China).</p>
