<p>For transcriptome analysis, mint (

 <sup>−2</sup>·s
 <sup>−1</sup>, with the 14 h photoperiod and temperature maintained at 25 °C/22 °C. For darkness treatment, black paper bags was used to cover the whole plants for 24h, then move the bags and exposure the plants to light 24 h. Leaves at the same developing stage were collection at 24h darkness treatment time point and at 24 h illumination time point. Control materials were collected at the same time point as darkness treatment. Three plants were selected as biological replicates. Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C before RNA extraction.
