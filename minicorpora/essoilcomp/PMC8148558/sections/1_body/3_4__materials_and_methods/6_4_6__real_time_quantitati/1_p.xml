<p>qRT-PCR was performed to verify the expression of selected genes. First-strand cDNA was synthesized with oligo (dT)18 and M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega). qRT-PCR analysis was carried out using the SYBR Universal qPCR Kit (Vazyme) on a qTOWER2.2 Real Time PCR Systems (Analytik, Jena, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and subjected to qPCR as described in Qi, et al. [
