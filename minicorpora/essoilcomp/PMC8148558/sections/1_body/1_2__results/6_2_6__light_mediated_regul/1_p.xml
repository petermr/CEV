<p>Transcription factors play important roles in the response to light, and they regulate multiple genes. Using the PlantTFDB database, 1601 TFs belonging to 57 families were identified. After analyzing the differential expression profiles, totals of 380 and 298 DEGs divided into 44 TF families were differentially expressed. The bHLH, ERF, MYB, and MYB-related, C2H2, bZIP, WRKY, NAC, HD-ZIP, and GRAS families were the top 10 most prevalent TF families. Among them, 235 TFs were upregulated and 145 TFs were downregulated following the 24 h darkness treatment. After removing the covers for 24 h, 166 TFs were upregulated and 132 TFs were downregulated. There were 67 TFs showing similar expression patterns to the terpenoids synthesis pathway genes. The expression levels of these genes were downregulated by darkness and upregulated after returning to light. The MYB family was the largest group, followed by the bHLH family. The opposite expression pattern (upregulated in darkness and downregulated in light) was displayed in 137 TFs. Among them, the ERF family was the largest group (
