<p>Several transcription factors belonging to the bHLH, ERF, MYB, and WRKY families have been determined to control terpenoid biosynthesis. We identified the homologs of the TFs whose functions are known, and which regulate terpenoid biosynthesis, by BLAST searching our transcriptomic data, and identified two MYC1, one MYC2, one WIN1, one ERF1, one WRKY40 and one R2R3-MYB genes. Apart from ERF1, which was significantly upregulated by the darkness treatment, all the genes were downregulated. Interestingly, not all the downregulated genes were upregulated after 24 h light exposure. The transcription levels of the four TFs belonging to the bHLH family and one WIN1 gene were not changed after returning to light for 24 h. The transcription levels of one WIN1, one WRKY40 and one R2R3-MYB were differentially expressed: the WRKY40 was upregulated back to its previous level before the darkness treatment, while the WIN1 and R2R3 MYB remained lower than their initial levels (
