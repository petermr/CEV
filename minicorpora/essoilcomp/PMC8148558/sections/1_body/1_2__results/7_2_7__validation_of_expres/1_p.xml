<p>To verify the reliability of the RNA-Seq data, the expression profiles of eight genes were analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). These genes are listed in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-10-00930">Supplemental Table S3</xref>. The expression patterns of the selected genes, in terms of the RPKM results, were consistent between the qRT-PCR and RNA-seq (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00930-f010">Figure 10</xref>). The following validation results for qRT-PCR indicate that the RNA-Seq data are quite reliable.
