<p>The organic compounds volatilized from mint leaves were collected via headspace sorption and analyzed via GC-MS. Fifteen volatile compounds were identified, accounting for 99.87% and 97.13% of the total volatile exudates in mint leaves under control and low light conditions, respectively. The changes in total volatile compounds and monoterpene compositions were investigated. The relative contents of volatile compounds were dramatically reduced compared to the internal standard substance, which was bornanone. The level of the main oxygenated monoterpene, menthol (constituting 32.02% of total volatile compounds), decreased to 12.85% following low light treatment. The proportion of pulegone increased from 0.95 to 8.70%, and that of piperitone increased from 1.23 to 28.31% (

The low light condition caused the accumulation of pulegone and piperitone, which are intermediate compounds in mint leaves, but had no reductive effect on the proportions of total monoterpene hydrocarbons or oxygenated monoterpenes (
