<p>We assessed the peltate glandular trichome densities on five separate zones, from the basal to the top regions, of the abaxial leaf surface of 
 <italic>Mentha canadensis</italic> under different light conditions. The results showed that the peltate glandular trichome (PGTs) densities were reduced by half a percent in all five zones under the low light condition (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00930-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). Basal zone 1 had a maximum of 27.75 ± 0.95 glands number per mm
 <sup>2</sup>, which decreased to 16.63 ± 2.67 glands per mm
 <sup>2</sup> under the low light condition (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00930-f001">Figure 1</xref>A,B). The top zone (zone 5) had a minimum PGT density of 11.5 ± 2.23 glands per mm
 <sup>2</sup>, which was significantly reduced to 4.87 ± 0.83 per mm
 <sup>2</sup> under the low light condition (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00930-f001">Figure 1</xref>A,B). An abundance of wrinkled PGTs were observed under low light conditions using scanning electron microscopy, indicating low essential oil accumulation in the subcuticular cavities of peltate glandular trichomes (
