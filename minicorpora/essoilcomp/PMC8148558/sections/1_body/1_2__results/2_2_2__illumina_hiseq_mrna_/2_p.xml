<p>The transcriptome sequencing was performed via an Illumina HiSeqTM 4000, which generated 72 million high-quality clean reads. Finally, a total of 95,579 all-unigenes with an N50 of 1260 bp were de novo assembled from the combined unigenes of three samples. The average length of the unigenes was 754bp (
