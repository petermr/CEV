<p>The expression profiles of all the DEGs adhered to two response patterns (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00930-f005">Figure 5</xref>A,B). Seven significant expression clusters were observed in all the DEGs under darkness treatment followed by recovery light. The DEGs in cluster 5 were upregulated under darkness and downregulated after recovery (4736 genes), and those in cluster 2 were downregulated under darkness and upregulated under light exposure (3399 genes) (
