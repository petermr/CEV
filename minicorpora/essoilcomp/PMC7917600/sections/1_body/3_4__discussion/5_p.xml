<p>Synergism of lethality was observed using the co-toxicity method, identifying oils that were synergistic with natural pyrethrins at the low dose application level (2 µg/insect) but not synergistic at the high dose level (10 µg/insect), oils that were synergistic at only the high dose level, those synergistic at both doses, and some that were not synergistic at either dose. This variety of responses was also true for antagonism. These findings demonstrate that synergist concentration must be an important consideration in the development of novel insecticidal mixtures. Unexpectedly, some oils and PBO were synergistic only at the low dose, but not at the high dose, which may result from sequestration of pyrethrins at the cuticular boundary. Moreover, it is possible that at the high dose, excess oil/ PBO did not fully penetrate the insect cuticle. Of these oils, nutmeg E.I. produced the largest co-toxicity factor (

While this study identified a number of novel synergistic plant essential oils, some apparent differences from other studies were noted. For example, Tak et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-insects-12-00154" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] showed that 10 µg/female doses of cedarwood, dill, and fennel oils applied in combination with permethrin did not produce statistically significant mortality greater than permethrin alone, whereas cedarwoods, dillweed and dillseed, and fennel oils synergized natural pyrethrins at the specific doses studied here. The greater potential of plant essential oils to increase the toxicity of natural pyrethrins vs. permethrin may result from greater susceptibility of natural pyrethrins to metabolic degradation than permethrin. If this is the case, inhibition of metabolic processes by plant essential oils may more significantly increase the toxicity of natural pyrethrins than permethrin. Norris et al. put forth a similar justification after finding type I pyrethroids were more strongly synergized by plant essential oils than type II pyrethroids [
