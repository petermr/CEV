<p>In order to characterize the synergistic potential of plant essential oils, we first screened them alone to better understand their toxicological contributions in our mixtures. A wide range of toxicities were observed, with balsam (Peru) producing the most significant knockdown at 1 h at the 10 µg/insect concentration. Seo et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-insects-12-00154" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] demonstrated that balsam (Peru) is predominantly composed of benzyl benzoate and benzyl cinnamate. These constituents may be useful leads for future insect control formulations, either as natural insecticides or agents that improve the knockdown effects of currently available insecticide formulations. In addition, a significant amount of recovery was observed in mosquitoes treated with this oil (73.3% knockdown at 1 h and 26.7% mortality at 24 h), indicating that metabolic processes probably detoxified the constituents within balsam (Peru) oil. Therefore, additional synergists such as PBO or S,S,S-tributylphosphorotrithioate (DEF) should increase the 24 h toxicity of this oil [

 <xref rid="B6-insects-12-00154" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] demonstrated that guaiacwood oil was predominantly composed of guaiol along with the minor constituent sesquiterpenoids, bulnesol, and bulnesene. Canadian balsam fir is predominantly composed of α-pinene, β-pinene, and phellandrene, any of which may be responsible for its toxicity [
