<p>Formulation additives can significantly augment the speed-of-action of select insecticides; therefore, understanding their contribution to speed-of-action is an important consideration, whether additive or synergistic [

These findings warrant future exploration as there may be agents within these oils that significantly potentiate the effects of natural pyrethrins directly on the insect nervous system or facilitate the penetration of natural pyrethrins across the cuticle. Screening the individual constituents from these oils directly on the nervous system in combination with pyrethroids will identify constituents acting via this mechanism. Moreover, if these oils increase insecticide penetration, it would be valuable to better understand the physicochemical factors underlying these activities. Increased penetration may be facilitated via improved passive diffusion across the cuticle (as in the case of calcofluor [
