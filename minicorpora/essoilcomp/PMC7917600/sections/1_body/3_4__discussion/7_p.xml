<p>Insecticide synergists improve the efficacy of various synthetic and natural insecticides, potentially allowing them to overcome insecticide resistance in the field [
 <xref rid="B31-insects-12-00154" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Future work should be done to assess how these affect insecticide resistance to various insecticidal classes. Previous studies have shown that specific plant essential oils increase the toxicity of permethrin and deltamethrin on both pyrethroid-resistant and pyrethroid-susceptible strains of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> [

 <xref rid="B14-insects-12-00154" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. As many of the essential oils screened in this exploration were not screened against insecticide-resistant strains, it is imperative to elucidate their potential as resistance-breaking insecticide additives. Moreover, Kumar et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-insects-12-00154" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] demonstrated that mosquito strains selected with deltamethrin over 40 generations were 60% less resistant when selected against combinations of PBO and deltamethrin (compared to deltamethrin alone). This suggests synergists may not only play a role after the development of insecticide resistance, but may serve to slow its development, also.
