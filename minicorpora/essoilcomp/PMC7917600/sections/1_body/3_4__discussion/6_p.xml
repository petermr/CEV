<p>To further evaluate the co-toxicity factor method, we selected a number of plant essential oils that produced co-toxicity factors greater than 20 (and those that produced co-toxicity factors between −20 and 20) to assess whether this method translated well to the established LD
 <sub>50</sub> ratio method of identifying synergism. If the co-toxicity factor method was meaningful and scientifically sound, it should translate well to another metric commonly utilized to measure synergism in the literature [

 <xref rid="B30-insects-12-00154" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In these studies, oils that produced co-toxicity factors greater than 20 also produced significant synergism ratios, such as Amyris, cedarwood (Virginian), and cedarwood (Texas). Moreover, the two oils that did not produce additive co-toxicity factors (i.e., between −20 and 20), citronella and fir needle oil, did not produce statistically significant synergism ratios. Correlation between traditional synergism ratios and co-toxicity factors at the 2 µg/insect level was quite strong (Pearson Correlation r = 0.94) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00154-f001">Figure 1</xref>). For example, Amyris produced the largest synergism ratio and the largest co-toxicity factor. Direct correlation was less pronounced when comparing the synergism ratios obtained using 2 µg/insect + NP with the co-toxicity factors obtained using 10 µg/insect of oil (Pearson Correlation r = 0.64). It is possible that the slope values of combined mixtures may directly affect the degree of co-toxicity factors observed at low or high potency screening concentrations, in addition to any number of toxicokinetic/dynamic factors. Differences in the ability of plant essential oils to inhibit metabolic processes or aid/hinder penetration of natural pyrethrins may also differ at each respective dose applied (2 or 10 µg). More work needs to be performed to comprehensively evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of this method, but our study supports the throughput and merit of co-toxicity metric analysis.
