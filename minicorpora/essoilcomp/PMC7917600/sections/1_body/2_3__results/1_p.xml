<p>Overall, plant essential oils exhibited a spectrum of activity when applied both alone and in combination with natural pyrethrins. Unique differences were observed in knockdown at 1 h and mortality at 24 h for each essential oil. At 2 (

 <xref rid="insects-12-00154-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), more plant essential oils caused significant knockdown and mortality compared to the ethanol control. Piperonyl butoxide (PBO), Amyris, balsam (Peru), cypress, and guaiacwood all produced significant 1 h knockdown, and among these, balsam (Peru) (73.3 ± 12%) produced the highest levels of 1 h knockdown at this screening concentration. Piperonyl butoxide (PBO), Amyris, Canadian balsam fir, citronella, and guaiacwood all produced statistically significant mortality compared to the ethanol control at 24 h when applied at 10 µg/insect; however, only PBO, Canadian balsam fir, and guaiacwood produced mortality that was greater than 50% (
