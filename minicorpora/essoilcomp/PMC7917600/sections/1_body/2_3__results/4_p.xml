<p>At the 10 µg/insect screening concentration, a number of oils synergized the 1 h knockdown and 24 h mortality produced by natural pyrethrins (
 <xref rid="insects-12-00154-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Cade, cardamom, cedarwood (Virginian), cypress, dillweed, fir needle, and guaiacwood oils synergized the knockdown of natural pyrethrins at 1 h, with fir needle oil being the most successful. Other oils either additively increased or antagonized 1 h knockdown. PBO strongly antagonized 1 h knockdown by natural pyrethrins at the 10 µg/insect concentration with a co-toxicity factor of −115, which was the most negative co-toxicity factor observed in this study. Among the oils, Amyris, balsam (Copaiba), balsam (Peru), Canadian balsam fir, cedarwood (Texas), and galbanum antagonized natural pyrethrins 1 h knockdown, whereas cedarleaf, dillseed, fennel, ginger root, nutmeg E.I., and parsley all additively increased 1 h knockdown of natural pyrethrins (
 <xref rid="insects-12-00154-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Many oils synergized natural pyrethrins mortality at 24 h at the 10 µg/insect concentration, whereas PBO did not. PBO instead produced high mortality when applied alone and the improvement of the combined mixture was minimal. Among the synergistic oils, Amyris, balsam (Copaiba), cardamom, cedarleaf, cedarwood (Texas), cedarwood (Virginian), dillseed, dillweed, fennel, ginger root, nutmeg E.I., and parsley, it was found that cardamom was the most active with a co-toxicity factor of 200. The remaining oils, with the exception of Canadian balsam fir and galbanum, increased the 24 h mortality of natural pyrethrins by an additive extent. Both Canadian balsam fir and galbanum antagonized the toxicity of natural pyrethrins at this concentration. Overall, the results in
