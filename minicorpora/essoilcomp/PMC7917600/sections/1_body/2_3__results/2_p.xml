<p>In order to screen for synergistic interactions between natural pyrethrins and plant essential oils, they were applied with a calculated LD
 <sub>25</sub> of natural pyrethrins. The theoretical LD
 <sub>25</sub> and LD
 <sub>50</sub> for natural pyrethrins were calculated to be 0.55 ng/mg insect and 1.53 ng/mg insect, respectively. As the weight for each mosquito cohort varied, we applied a discrete dose (1.6 ng/insect) assuming mosquitoes in each cohort weighed 2.85 mg/mosquito (average of five cohorts of mosquitoes). The theoretical LD
 <sub>25</sub> produced 14 ± 1.9% mortality at 24 h when averaged across all replicates. The range of average mortality for all cohorts (groups of three or more replicates associated with selected plant essential oils within each group) was 6.6–22% mortality. As mortality produced by the theoretical dose was lower than expected (i.e., below 25%), we calculated the co-toxicity factors using the actual percentage mortality produced by natural pyrethrins within each cohort to avoid cohort biases.
