<p>To assess the utility and accuracy of the co-toxicity factor metric, we screened a number of plant essential oils and PBO (applied at a sublethal dose of 2 Âµg/insect) with variable concentrations of natural pyrethrins. The LD
 <sub>50</sub> values for natural pyrethrins in these experiments were then compared to the original LD
 <sub>50</sub> of natural pyrethrins to obtain a synergism ratio (
 <xref rid="insects-12-00154-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Of the oils screened in these follow-up studies, Amyris oil + natural pyrethrins produced the lowest LD
 <sub>50</sub> value (0.21 ng/mg mosquito) and the highest synergism ratio (7.3). Cedarwood (Texas) also produced significant synergism, but the synergism ratio for this formulation was 4, very similar to that produced by PBO (5.1). The other cedarwood oil, Virginian, also produced significant synergism with a synergism ratio of 3.6. Interestingly, both fir needle oil and citronella oil produced low levels of toxicity synergism, but these were not significant as indicated by 
 <italic>t</italic>-test; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.59 for fir needle oil and 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.74 for citronella. Slope values for natural pyrethrins were relatively unchanged by combined application with these plant essential oils.
