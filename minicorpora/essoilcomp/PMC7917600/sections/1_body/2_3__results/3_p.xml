<p>Of the various oils, some produced synergism when applied with natural pyrethrins at 2 µg/insect, both of knockdown and mortality (
 <xref rid="insects-12-00154-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Cedarwood (Virginian), dillseed, fir needle oil, fennel, and parsley all produced knockdown co-toxicity factors greater than 20. In this assessment, fir needle oil performed the best with a knockdown co-toxicity factor of 77.6. This response was largely driven by the lack of knockdown produced by fir needle oil and the relatively high increase in knockdown for the mixture (53.3 ± 18.6%). Many other oils increased the knockdown effects of natural pyrethrins, but these were essentially additive, producing co-toxicity factors between −20 and 20 (

PBO antagonized knockdown with only 10 ± 3.7% knockdown observed in combinations of PBO and natural pyrethrins, whereas 47% knockdown was observed for natural pyrethrins alone. Of the oils, balsam (Copaiba), cade, Canadian balsam fir, dillweed, and ginger root all antagonized the quick immobilizing character of natural pyrethrins at 1 h, with co-toxicity factors less than −20. Of these, Canadian balsam fir was the most antagonistic (co-toxicity factor = −63.6). At the screening concentration of 2 µg/insect, numerous oils/agents synergized mortality. PBO, the commercial synergist standard used in this study, provided a high degree of synergism with a co-toxicity factor of 71 (

Amyris, balsam (Copaiba), cedarwood (Texas), cedarwood (Virginian), dillseed, fennel, fir needle oil, and nutmeg E.I. all produced synergism with co-toxicity factors greater than 20. Of these, nutmeg E.I. produced the largest co-toxicity factor (300). The other oils produced additive increases in mortality at 24 h, with the exception of cade, cardamom, cypress, dillweed, galbanum, and ginger root, which produced antagonistic co-toxicity factors (
