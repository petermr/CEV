<p>The goal of this study was to assess the ability of various plant essential oils to improve the toxicity of natural pyrethrins against 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> of the insecticide-susceptible Orlando strain. For this, we acquired 20 plant essential oils and screened them alone and in combination with natural pyrethrins at discrete doses to characterize their potential to improve knockdown and lethality. To identify and quantify synergism produced by various plant essential oils, we utilized a co-toxicity factor method proposed by Mansour et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-insects-12-00154" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. After calculating the co-toxicity factor for various doses of plant essential oils applied in combination with natural pyrethrins, we calculated traditional synergism ratios for selected oils to evaluate the co-toxicity factor method as a diagnostic tool for the identification of novel synergists.
