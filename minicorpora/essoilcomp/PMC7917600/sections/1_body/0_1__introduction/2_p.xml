<p>Some components in essential oil-based insecticide formulations are considered “generally recognized as safe” (GRAS) by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) [
 <xref rid="B4-insects-12-00154" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These components are listed in the 25b Exempt category under FIFRA code due to their usage throughout human history, and because they are found in many household food items and fragrances [

 <xref rid="B5-insects-12-00154" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Reclassification of certain components has relaxed the regulatory requirements for registration of plant essential oil-based insecticides and repellents, and allowed for the rapid diversification of novel products. Coupled with the recent consumer-driven push for more natural and “green” control strategies, more of these products are now available for purchase than ever before [

 <xref rid="B5-insects-12-00154" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. While not as potent as synthetic insecticides, their potential to kill and repel arthropods is appreciable [

 <xref rid="B8-insects-12-00154" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Moreover, many oils have been shown to produce potent synergism with various synthetic insecticides, further demonstrating their utility. Gross et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-insects-12-00154" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] demonstrated that various plant essential oils could enhance the toxicity of permethrin against adult female 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>. Norris et al. [
 <xref rid="B6-insects-12-00154" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] showed that the most successful plant oils in the Gross et al. 2015 study could synergize diverse type I and type II pyrethroids, further indicating their activity as synergists. It is important to continually identify novel synergists and toxic additives that could be combined with synthetic insecticides in future insecticidal formulations.
