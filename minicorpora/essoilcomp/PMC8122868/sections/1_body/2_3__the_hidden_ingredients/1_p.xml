<p>Olfactory experiences of floral scents are mirrored by the chemical diversity of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by plants around the world. EOS in food as fragrances or antioxidants, part of the fragrant composition in perfumes or agrochemicals, are complicated mixtures of many VOCs. The significant majority of them are terpene hydrocarbons and terpenoides (their monofunctional derivatives). Moreover, it can be found in numerous aromatic and aliphatic esters, aromatic aldehydes, phenols, ketones, ethers and heterocycles. There are too many examples of the great wealth of ingredients in essential oils to list them here. In some cases, the content of aromatic substances in essential oils is so high that it is profitable to separate them, either by distillation or fractionated freezing. These isolates are widely applied in food, pharmaceutical and chemistry industry. Some representative examples of isolates are depicted in
