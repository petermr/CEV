<p>2-Phenylethanol 
 <bold>39</bold> can be isolated in pure form via fractional distillation of rose essential oil or through various synthetic routes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02473-f006">Figure 6</xref>). It has a pleasant rose-like floral odour. Natural alcohol as an isolate is used in food industry as a flavouring agent, but for perfumery application it is synthesized or produced by microbial fermentation from L-phenylalanine [

 <bold>40</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02473-f006">Figure 6</xref>). Moreover, this compound can be found in other EOS like geranium, palmarosa, 
 <italic>Cymbopogon martini</italic> (Roxb.) W.Watson or 
 <italic>Monarda fistulosa</italic> L. var. 
 <italic>menthifolia.</italic> In the last case, the content of this compound in EOS is over 95% [
 <xref rid="B84-molecules-26-02473" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. The demand for this compound is relatively high and is estimated over 1000 tons per year. It is widely applied both in the perfumery industry and in domestic and household products [
 <xref rid="B85-molecules-26-02473" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Due to the high demand for geraniol, it is also obtained by semi-synthetic methods from other natural isolates, such as α-pinene, β-pinene, linalool or citral. It is impossible to list all isolates that are obtained from plant material. Finally, cedrol 
 <bold>41</bold>, α-santanol 
 <bold>42</bold> and β-santanol 
 <bold>43</bold> can be mentioned (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02473-f006">Figure 6</xref>). Cedrol is obtained from Texas cedarwood oil and is a precursor for other fragrant substances for the cosmetic industry, like cedryl acetate [

The situation is somewhat different with sandalwood oil and santalols—its main components. Due to the overexploitation of sandalwood, its resources are diminishing, especially in India and Indonesia. Sandalwood oil can be obtained from trees that are at least 30 years old. In order to meet the growing demand for sandalwood oil, sandalwood plantations have been established, for example in Australia. The current price of the oil is nearly USD 100,000 per ton. Sandalwood EOS is widely applied in perfumery as a fixative [
