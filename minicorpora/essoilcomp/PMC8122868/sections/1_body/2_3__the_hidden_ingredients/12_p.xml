<p>Linalool 
 <bold>27</bold> is an unsaturated aliphatic alcohol belonging to the terpenes group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02473-f005">Figure 5</xref>). It exists in two enantiomeric forms. 
 <italic>S</italic>-Linalool has a pleasant floral scent. In turn, the fragrance of 
 <italic>R</italic>-linalool is dominated by wood and lavender accents. It can be obtained as an isolate from essential oils of 
 <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic> L. and 
 <italic>L. latifolia</italic> Medik. In recent years there has been a growing interest in the application of essential oils to traditionally-used preservatives. Just recently Hussein et al. [
 <xref rid="B70-molecules-26-02473" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] investigated the effect of linalool and piperine on the quality of chicken meat stored in refrigerated conditions. Both compounds retarded the growth of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and ensured the stabilization of meat colour parameters. Linalyl acetate 
 <bold>28</bold> is a colourless liquid with a floral, fruity scent (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02473-f005">Figure 5</xref>). It can be obtained from lavender oil (
 <italic>L. angustifolia</italic>), whose main ingredients are linalool (37.11%) and linalyl acetate (34.96%) [
 <xref rid="B71-molecules-26-02473" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Together with linalool these compounds are substances applied for flavouring Earl Grey teas [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-26-02473" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Both compounds can be also isolated from bergamot essential oil. Bergamot oil is used in the production of candies. The most famous are traditional Turkish 
 <italic>Akide</italic> hard candies considered to be Turkeyâ€™s culinary heritage and amber-coloured French 
 <italic>Bergamotes de Nancy</italic>. The last candies are produced from sugar and glucose syrup with bergamote oil. However, the largest amounts of linalyl acetate are consumed by the perfume industry, where it is used for many fragrance compositions, such as lavender, ylang-ylang and fancy. Linalyl acetate is more volatile than linalool and is used for the creation of a fresh top-note to a fragrance.
