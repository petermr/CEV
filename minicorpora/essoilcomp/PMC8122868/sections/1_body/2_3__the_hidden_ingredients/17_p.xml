To quote an opinion on benzyl acetate from Hermitageoils (Europe’s Specialist Supplier of Naturals): “This incredibly beautiful material is the result of a fractional distillation of ylang ylang flowers and it shows perfect harmony with jasmine,” [

When looking for the possibility of purchasing this compound for perfumery or food purposes, one can find offers where sellers claim that this compound is a natural isolate from peach fruit. It seems, however, that it is currently a niche production and the price of such a product is correspondingly high. In the 1980s, it was over USD 10,000 per kilogram. Due to the significant demand for this compound, reaching several hundred tons per year, its entire industrial production is based on biotechnological methods based on ricinoleic acid, which allowed to reduce the price of this lactone to USD 300 per kilogram [
