<p>The two enantiomeric varieties of carvone are an elegant example of the structural influence on the olfactory properties of a compound. 
 <italic>R</italic>-Carvone 
 <bold>22</bold> has a mint scent while its mirror image, 
 <italic>S</italic>-carvone 
 <bold>23</bold>, smells like caraway (

Both spices have been known since ancient times as references to them are already found, for example, in the Bible in the Book of Isaiah. 
 <italic>R</italic>-Carvone is used in chewing gum industry (e.g., Wrigley spearmint) to enhance the impact and extend the duration of the fruit flavour [

 <italic>S</italic>-carvone is responsible for aroma in German 
 <italic>KÃ¼mmel</italic> liquor or Scandinavian 
 <italic>akvavit</italic>. Spearmint containing 
 <italic>R</italic>-carvone is an ingredient of many mixed drinks and mint flavoured liquors, e.g., in Spain in
