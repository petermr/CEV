<p>Citronellal 
 <bold>25</bold> is a main constituent of Citronella essential oil from Java or Ceylon (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02473-f005">Figure 5</xref>). The oils are produced via steam distillation of fresh or dry herb (
 <italic>Cymbopogon nardus</italic> (L.) Rendle or 
 <italic>C. winterianus</italic> Jowitt ex Bor). Both oils differ in terms of smell. Java oil has a strong lemon scent, while Ceylon oil has a citronellal one. Due to their very strong aroma, both oils are used in low doses in products such as alcoholic beverages, breakfast cereals, jelly, soft drinks and various candies [

 <bold>26</bold> is colourless liquid with a pleasant, rose-like scent. It can be obtained from geranium or citronella (
 <italic>C. nardus</italic>) essential oils by fractional distillation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02473-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Rhodinol is approved as a flavouring ingredient and is used for the composition of floral and rose notes.
