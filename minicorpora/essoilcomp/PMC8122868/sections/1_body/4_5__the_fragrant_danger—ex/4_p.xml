<p>Another way to use aromatic plants biomass in agriculture is mulching fields, both with living mulch and processed biomass derived from fragrant plants. The latter means planting aromatic plants as stubble or cover crops after a cash crop and leaving whole biomass in the soil, planting with another plant or for the winter season. The fragrant residues primarily inhibit the weed occurrence. This practice is, for now, used in agriculture of tropical climates due to the common occurrence of aromatic species in natural conditions. Dhima et al. [
 <xref rid="B143-molecules-26-02473" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>] study an anti-weed effect of mulch from seven annual aromatic plants and determined that the number of barnyard grass plants emerging from anise, lacy phacelia and common balm green manure plots was lower by 47%, 49% and 50%, respectively (compared with green manure-free plots). Moreover, in oregano and lacy phacelia-green manure-herbicide-untreated plots, maize silage yield was 33–34% greater than that in the green manure-free herbicide-untreated plots. In the research of landscape mulches aromatic plants (mainly trees and shrubs) play a pivotal role. However, a few features of them are monitored to meet the needs of urban architecture (i.e., retain or changing their colour, rate of decomposition). Among the studied species, Duryea et al. [
 <xref rid="B144-molecules-26-02473" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>] defined the longest-lasting colour (i.e., not changing during a year) as ‘reddish brown’ offered by pine bark mulch. Other mulches (from 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic>, 
 <italic>Melaleuca</italic>, Pine needles) transformed their colour more or less in shades of grey during the year. Mulch from Cypress transforming its colour every three months (starts from pink, then reddish yellow, pink, light brown, and again pink after one year).
