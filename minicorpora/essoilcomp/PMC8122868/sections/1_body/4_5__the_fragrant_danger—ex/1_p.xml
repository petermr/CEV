<p>Plants have had 400 million years to develop highly complex chemical defences against specific predators, and extracts from plants have been used by humans for at least 2000 years to deter or kill plant pests. It so happens that substances that are toxic to plant pests usually also have a specific smell. Extracts [

 <xref rid="B131-molecules-26-02473" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>], decoctions and macerates are used for this purpose, but essential oils, as the most concentrated form of allelochemicals isolated from plants, are a promising alternative to chemical substances used in agriculture or for food processing. In 2009, the EU Commission issued Directive 2009/128/EC [

However, besides the very long and expensive legal procedure, the main problem of commercialization of such substances of natural origin is the need to standardize the procedure that gives a unified productâ€™s content, which is not always easy taking into account the need to diversify the supply of raw material, its genetic variability [
