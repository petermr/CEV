<p>From living aboveground plant parts two main processes could occur: volatilization and leaching processes [
 <xref rid="B100-molecules-26-02473" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. The first one is a source of volatiles (essential oils), mainly terpenes, which are released from specialised morphological structures, and the second one occurs when raindrops reach the leaf and wash away a larger amount of substances soluble in water, like organic acids, phenols, glycosides, alkaloids or flavonoids. Additionally, underground parts of plants release exudates, which very easily penetrate into the soil solution thanks to its hydrophilic character (through osmosis) or persist near the roots as a hydrophobic molecules [
