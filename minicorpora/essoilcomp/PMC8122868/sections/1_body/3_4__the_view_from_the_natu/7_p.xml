<p>Summarizing, many factors influence floral scent emission. In addition to the environmental features, like temperature [

 <xref rid="B126-molecules-26-02473" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>], there are a few biotic factors affecting this process, like plant pollination strategies [

 <xref rid="B128-molecules-26-02473" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>], density of plants or the presence of other plant species [
 <xref rid="B129-molecules-26-02473" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. Moreover, the ecology of plants indicated that they secreted fragrant substances not only to attract pollinators, but also for defence against pests (florivore, herbivore and microbial agents). Therefore, the fragrant molecules play a dual role in plant ecology.
