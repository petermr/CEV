<p>Sometimes to obtain a fragrant substance there is the necessity to decay the plant (trees from genus 
 <italic>Aquilaria</italic> (agarwood) and 
 <italic>Gyrinops</italic>, Thymelaeaceae family) through mold (like Ascomycetous mold, 
 <italic>Phaeoacremonium parasitica</italic> (Ajello, Georg and C.J.K. Wang) W. Gams, P.W. Crous and M.J. Wingf.) [

 <italic>Aquilaria</italic> trees are endangered and protected, and agarwood scent cannot be synthesized, although chemical substitutes already exist, but do not come even close in mimicking the natural product [
