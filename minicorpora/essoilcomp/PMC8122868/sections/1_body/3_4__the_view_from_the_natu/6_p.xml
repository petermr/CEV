<p>Among the common role of scent, namely positively affects pollinators and seed fitness [
 <xref rid="B119-molecules-26-02473" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>], there are reverse trend in Nature, too. Sometimes fragrant scent (e.g., 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol 
 <bold>48</bold>) attracts not only pollinators, but also florivores (like in orchid 
 <italic>Dichaea pendula</italic> (Aubl.) Cogn.) [
 <xref rid="B120-molecules-26-02473" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02473-f007">Figure 7</xref>). Compound 
 <bold>48</bold> is also responsible for “clove” odour of some beers like 
 <italic>Weisbier</italic> and 
 <italic>Wit</italic> [
 <xref rid="B121-molecules-26-02473" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. The study of Theis and Adler [
 <xref rid="B122-molecules-26-02473" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>] confirms that florivory as well as pollination has shaped the evolution of floral scent, and indicate the pronounced role of compound 1,4-dimethoxybenzene 
 <bold>49</bold> in this mechanism (
