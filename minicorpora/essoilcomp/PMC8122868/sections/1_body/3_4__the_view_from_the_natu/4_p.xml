<p>The highest quantity of fragrant substances is located in the following parts of plants: leaves and seeds (or fruits), and in flowers, as well. As mentioned above, the morphology of these organs is created in precisely the way as to contain secretory cells and spaces, that store secreted substances. Secreting cells produce large amounts of special metabolism products, thus they characterize features associated with intense metabolism: Dense cytoplasm, well-developed endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, large cell nuclei with a high content of DNA, occurring often as a polyploid type. Secretory units can accumulate bubbles with fragrant substances internally (finally mainly in vacuoles) or externally. The second way is most frequently used by plants. It occurs when secretory cells are located in some areas of epiderma and secreting fragrant substances through the cell wall. This process is realized by terpenoid glandular trichomes located on the skin surface [

Interesting is that not only has genetics influenced the chemical composition of aroma compounds in plants but, in basil leaves (
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic>), it may change after various colours of artificial mulch have been applied during cultivation. Loughrin and Kasperbauer [
 <xref rid="B111-molecules-26-02473" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>] found that the change of the ratios of red, blue and far-red light reflected to growing plants can influence both leaf morphology and chemistry. These leaves developing over red surfaces had greater area, moisture percentage, and fresh weight than those developing over black surfaces. Interestingly, basil plants grown over yellow and green surfaces produced significantly higher concentrations of aroma compounds than those grown over white and blue covers.
