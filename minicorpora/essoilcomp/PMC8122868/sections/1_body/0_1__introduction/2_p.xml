<p>In 1985, a German writer, Patrick Süskind, wrote a novel entitled “
 <italic>Perfume: The Story of a Murderer</italic>”. The plot of the action focused on an orphan with an unusually developed sense of smell who later became a perfumer capable of the creation of perfume compositions beyond human imagination. In a very short time, this story turned out to be an international bestseller with over 20 million sold copies around the world. In addition to this, 20 years later a film adaptation was premiered. What was the source of success both of the novel and the film adaptation as well? It seems that the reason for this success may be the fact that, from the very beginning, man has been surrounded by smells that provided pleasure and also warned against dangers, such as spoiled food. The aromas surrounding us are extremely diverse so we accumulate countless odour experiences throughout our lives.
