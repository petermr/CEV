<p>Everyone is familiar with the overpowering vanilla scent in ice cream, but it can be found in matured whisky as well. In the first case the vanillin

 <bold>2</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02473-f002">Figure 2</xref>) additives are responsible for this; in the second one, the vanillin is formed due to the decomposition of the lignin structure in oak barrels staves [

 <bold>5</bold> (e.g., (
