<p>In the case of the aforementioned thermal treatment, some volatile compounds are lost and the flavour of the resulting product may be different from the starting components. By now, due to the fragrant food additives, we are able to restore these aromas to a certain extent. The addition of some synthetic or natural aromas to food products increases their tastiness and sensory attractiveness. These substances are not always friendly to our health. It happens that during the heat treatment of processed foods a Maillard reaction occurs, resulting in melanoidine molecules (the pigment responsible for the colour of bread crust or roasted meat) and by-products, e.g., furfuryl aldehyde

Nowadays, due to a greater socio-consumer awareness regarding food preservatives, consumers prefer to choose products that are enriched with natural fragrances or processed without the addition of artificial preservatives, e.g., osmotic dehydration [
