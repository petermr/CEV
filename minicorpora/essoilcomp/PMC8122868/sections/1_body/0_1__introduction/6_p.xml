<p>Another important matter related to the fragrances for human beings is food, i.e., their smell and taste of food. These features can be totally changed by microorganisms or surrounding conditions, e.g., as a result of improper storage (warm and aerobic conditions, as well as moisture) [

The developing microbiota enrich food with their metabolites, whose smells and flavours are quite different from the characteristics of the starting material. The species responsible for the formation of unpleasant smells and flavours are, e.g.,
