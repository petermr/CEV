<p>It should be remembered that a substance, to be included in the fragrance group, must be volatile (ability to evaporate at room temperature) and have the ability to interact with olfactory receptors. There are two ways we smell: the orthonasal (directly through the nose) and the retronasal (when the smell gets to the nose from the mouth) routes [

Chemicals with a mass of less than 300 Daltons bind to proteins on the olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) at the surface of the olfactory epithelium. Then, the irritation of ORNs produces a gallery of sensory items in the brain that is a representation of the chemical features coming from the external world. Some efforts achieved in gathering all odorants and their retention times received in gas chromatography-olfactometry [

In other words, odours, unlike the other sensory inputs, go straight to the limbic system and cerebrum, without processing by the thalamus. That means our bodies respond emotionally and physiologically to scent before we think about it [

As a total, 1000 different proteins together encoded by 3% of human genes are located in the olfactory receptors, and these are more responsible for the taste of food than the tastebuds in the mouth, for which Buck and Axel were awarded the Nobel Prize in 2004 [

Thanks to these body and brain abilities, nowadays, there are even new methods in medicine for treating people through the sense of smell, called aromatherapy. It is an alternative method of healing and strengthening the body, using the olfactory channel to stimulate the brain in a different way than medications or physical therapies can [
