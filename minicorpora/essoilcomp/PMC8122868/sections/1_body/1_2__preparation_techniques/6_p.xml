<p>The disadvantages of the abovementioned method are the prolonged time of extraction, hydrolytic decomposition of extracted compounds (e.g., esters) and solvent residues in the final material. Lucchesi and co-workers [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-02473" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] developed a new technique named 
 <italic>solvent-free microwave extraction</italic> (SFME), in which the fresh plant material was irradiated in a microwave oven without any solvent. Dry seeds were moistened prior to use. The volatiles were collected in a Clevenger apparatus. The authors reported significant time and energy reduction in comparison with the classical hydro-distillation procedures. Microwave-assisted chemical reactions settled permanently in the chemistry laboratory, but there is a constant need for new techniques in the laboratory and in industry as well. Such an example is the application of ultrasound in laboratory practice in organic and analytical chemistry [

 <italic>Eau de perfumes</italic> (10–20% of essential oils), 
 <italic>eau de cologne</italic> (3–5% of perfume in alcohol/water) and 
 <italic>eau de toilette</italic> (less than 2% of perfume) [
