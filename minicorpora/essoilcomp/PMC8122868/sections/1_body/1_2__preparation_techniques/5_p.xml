<p>The ingredients of EOS are sensitive to temperature and the direct distillation may cause their decomposition and it canâ€™t be applied. The solution is the 
 <italic>steam distillation</italic>. In the classic version plant material is placed in an alembic over boiling water on the perforated tray. The passing steam removes volatile substances. The distillate is collected in a receiver and, due to the insolubility of EOS in water, the upper (or lower layer) of EOS can be easily separated. The collected material can be subjected to fractional distillation and rectification under reduced pressure. In 
 <italic>hydrodistillation</italic> method plant materials and water are heated together in the alembic and vaporised essential oils and steam are condensed like in the previous method. This process can be supported with microwave heating of the plant material/water mixture for more effective isolation of aromatic substances [
