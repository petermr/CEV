<p>Another equally old technique is 
 <italic>enfleurage</italic>. It is an extraction of volatile substances from plants with cold animal fat like lard or tallow. After leaving for a few days, plant material is removed and replaced with the fresh one. This procedure is repeated several times. Finally, the fat saturated with essential oils is mixed with alcohol in which aromatic substances are dissolved and the fat is separated off. After evaporation of the alcohol solution an absolute is obtained. This technique was applied to flowers very sensitive to temperature, like jasmine, tuberose or orange. It was used in ancient Egypt and in France. The variation of this procedure is an application of hot fat (60–70 °C). Due to the high costs cold and hot 
 <italic>enfleurage</italic> was abandoned and replaced with more effective solvent extraction with ethyl alcohol, low-boiling hydrocarbons, aliphatic esters or florasol (1,1,1,2-terafluoroethane). This procedure is applied for the preparation of jasmine absolute. The disadvantage of this extraction can be the residues of extractive solvents in the final product. This can be avoided by using extraction with a supercritical fluid (SFE) with a solvent like butane, propane, ethylene or carbon dioxide. On the industrial scale it is used for extraction of caffeine from coffee and tea and hop essential oils [
