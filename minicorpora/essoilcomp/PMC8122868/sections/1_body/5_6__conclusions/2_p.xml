<p>This very short review gives a small glimpse into the application of fragrant substances of plant origin across a variety of industries. At present, a total of 2000â€“3000 flavouring chemicals, both natural and synthetic, are used commercially, and various fragrant substances are used as pest management control agents. The search and analysis of natural fragrant substances are especially challenging due to a future of sustaining agriculture practices and production of healthy food, as well as biocenotic homeostasis. Some of them have very promising medicinal features in treating depression, pain, and microbiologically-based diseases. On the other hand, the rapid progress in modern analytical techniques gives birth to the hope that many new aromatic molecules will be isolated and characterised in the future. Moreover, we have to remember that a large number of organic chemists from academic and industrial laboratories constantly modify known structures and synthesise new molecules with interesting fragrant properties, which do not exist in nature, so we can expect new olfactory experiences.</p>
