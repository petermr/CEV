 <italic>Piper</italic> species belong to one of the largest genera of basal angiosperm [
 <xref rid="R97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>] and are widespread in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. They have a long history of use in traditional medicine and many studies have aimed to prove their efficacy. For instance, EOs from 
 <italic>P. auritum</italic> showed promising results in the inhibition of promastigote proliferation in different species of the 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> genus [
 <xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], and EOs from 
 <italic>P. hispidum</italic> showed high antileishmanial activity [
 <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Also, 
 <italic>P. cubeba</italic> EOs have anti-trypomastigote and anti-amastigote activity in 
 <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> [
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Various compounds from different species have been studied to assess these activities: dihydrochalcones from 
 <italic>P. longicaudatum,</italic> where asebogenin (2′,6′,4-trihydroxy-4′-methoxydihydrochalcone) showed inhibitory effects against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA) [
 <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]; prenylated hydroquinone from 
 <italic>P. crassinervium</italic> with trypanocidal activity [
 <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]; and eupomatenoid-5 isolated from leaves of 
 <italic>P. regnellii</italic> which induces apoptosis in 
 <italic>Leishmania amazonensis</italic> [
 <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].
