<p>Many of the biological proprieties of 
 <italic>P. aduncum</italic> EO have been studied, for instance its antibacterial and antifungal activity [
 <xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], which showed good results against the problematic agents of nosocomial infections such as 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. lentus</italic> [
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Similarly, there are promising results in the prevention of infection in immunocompetent or immunocompromised patients for its activity against 
 <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> [
 <xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. There are also antioxidant [
 <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], anti-inflammatory [
 <xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] and antiplatelet [
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] activities, among others.
