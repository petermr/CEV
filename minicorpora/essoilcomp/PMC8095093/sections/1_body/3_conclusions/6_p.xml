<p>Dillapiole seems to be the most valuable compound among those forming this EO and for the same reason should be extensively studied. Even though essential oils may be a source of allergy in humans, dillapiole has not been added to the list of 26 fragrance ingredients listed as allergens in Annex III of the European Unionâ€™s Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety Opinion on Fragrance allergens in cosmetic products (SCCS/1459/11). Interestingly, a study performed by Aciole 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (2013) [
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], on dillapiole identified genetic toxicity on somatic cells of 
 <italic>Drosophila melanogaster.</italic> Hsuuw and Chan (2015) [
 <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] investigated the effects of dillapiole on mouse oocyte maturation, showing a potential teratogenic effect. The authors suggest that the effect of dillapiole on human oocytes should also be investigated in order to assess the safety of its application as a drug or biocide. These findings indicate that dillapiole should be studied further to determine its possible toxicity in humans. For instance, it would be useful to evaluate its effects in synergy with other compounds to find the most useful match, as it has been shown that the oils are more effective when used in their totality than just in main component form. Other compounds are also of interest based on the data shown in the tables, as in some cases they are even the main compound instead of dillapiole, for example myristicin or 1,8-cineole. Therefore, a more specific study of these isolated components is required to have a wider understanding of the entire EO.
