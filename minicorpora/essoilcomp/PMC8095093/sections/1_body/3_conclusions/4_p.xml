<p>Concerning the mode of action, EOs are generally able to affect insects and mites through neurotoxic effects involving the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and an effect on the octopamine synapses and GABA receptors. In particular, due to the presence of methylene dioxy rings, dillapiole may inhibit insect P450 cytochrome activity. This mechanism affects the phase I metabolism of xenobiotics, which is responsible for inactivating the insecticides. EOs also exert repellent activity, blocking the odour receptor neurons (ORNs) of the insects [
