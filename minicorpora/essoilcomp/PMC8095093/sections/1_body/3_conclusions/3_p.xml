<p>EOs are a promising natural alternative as insecticides, acaricides and antiparasitic products, but researchers and industry must address several challenges in order to obtain new commercial products. EOs are recognised as ecofriendly, biodegradable and cost effective raw materials [
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and generally present very low mammalian toxicity and short environmental persistence [
 <xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Unfortunately, precisely due to their short persistence, EOs exert a short duration of action and require several applications or additional efforts on formulation strategies. The most common formulation strategy is to add chemical fixatives or stabilizers to the EO, in order to prolong effects. Fixatives make it possible to slow evaporation of EOs due to their lower volatility in comparison with EOs compounds. Promising results with natural (vanillin) and synthetic fixatives (Glucam P-20, Fixolide) have been reported by Songkro 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (2012) [
