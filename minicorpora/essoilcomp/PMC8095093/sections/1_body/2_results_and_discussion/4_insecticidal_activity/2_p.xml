<p>Concerning use of the EO, or its main compound in these experiments that isolated it from the rest of the components, a variety of methods were used: topical, with direct application to the insect using a specialized instrument regarding the type or stage of the insect; contact, allowing the insect to move through a surface where the EO was placed, or through the substance diluted in water; fumigation, mostly obtained by evaporation of the solution containing diluted EO; immersion, where the organism was directly submerged in the solution; and spraying. For the fumigation and contact experiments, residual effects were also often determined. Finally, activity was expressed in multiple forms, for instance adulticide, larvicide and ovicide effects, or repellency to oviposition. Almost all results expressed the lethal concentration (LC) of the EO that affected at least 50% of the insects tested. This concentration was also expressed as lethal dose (LD), lethal time (LT) or effective dose (ED). ED was related to the efficiency of repelling mosquitos from the human body. These measurements depended on how the researcher wished to express EO lethality. Considering for example the larvicidal effect in 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> and where dillapiole was the main compound of the EO applied through contact or fumigation, we find that the LC
 <sub>50</sub> ranged between 57 and 200Î¼g/mL.
