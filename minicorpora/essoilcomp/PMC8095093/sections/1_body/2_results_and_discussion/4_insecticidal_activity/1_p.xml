 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, we show the results obtained in experiments on the insecticidal properties of the EO. We indicate the scientific names and how the insect is commonly classified. When specified, the concentration of dillapiole ranged between the 8.43% to the 85.4% if the EO was used in its totality. Only four experiments did not show the presence of dillapiole: one of them used dried fruits to extract the EO, differing from most of the other experiments that mainly used leaves. Many papers focused on activity against
