<p>In 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, we report antiparasitic activities, specifying the scientific name of each organism. Articles have been published concerning the toxicity of the EO against various species, such as 
 <italic>Haemonchus contortus</italic> and 
 <italic>Hysterothylacium</italic> sp., whereas most of the experiments aimed to determine activity against the genus 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic>, the protozoa responsible for leishmaniasis, followed by 
 <italic>Trypanosoma</italic>, which causes Chagas disease. Lastly, a number of studies were related to 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, suggesting that it may be more likely to overcome malaria using essential oils against its vector (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), rather than approaches against the protozoa that causes the disease.
