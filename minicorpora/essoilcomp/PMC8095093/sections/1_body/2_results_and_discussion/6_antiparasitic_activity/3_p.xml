<p>When specified, the concentration of dillapiole was always higher than 75%. In this case, the EO was mostly applied through incubation in which it was added to the infected cell cultivation and placed in the best conditions (usually 37°C) for protozoan growth, for at least 24h. Efficiency was mostly expressed as activity against promastigotes. For instance, in the case of 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic>, to inhibit the growth of at least 50% (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of promastigotes, about 15μg/mL of the EO with dillapiole are needed as the main component.
