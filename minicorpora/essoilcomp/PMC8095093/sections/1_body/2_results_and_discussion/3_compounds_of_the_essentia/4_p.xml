<p>Dillapiole was almost always the main component characterising the oil, followed by myristicin. However, the articles highlight variable abundance mainly due to the different growth conditions and geographical origins, which inevitably affect the qualitative and quantitative profile of the phytocomplex. Dillapiole was the most cited component and the one that had the most promising proprieties, but importantly dillapiole showed better activities as a component of the entire EO than as an isolated compound. Due to this variability, dillapiole amounts ranged from 9.20% [
 <xref rid="R94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>] to 94.84% [
 <xref rid="R87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>], even though several studies reported that dillapiole represents more than the 70% of total essential oil composition, as reported in
