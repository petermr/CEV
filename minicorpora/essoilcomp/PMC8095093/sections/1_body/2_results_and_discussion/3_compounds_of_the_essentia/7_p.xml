<p>Like other phenylpropanoids, dillapiole is a result of the shikimic acid pathway [
 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and several authors found biological activities of the isolated molecule or EOs rich in dillapiole. It can be found in a variety of plants, and various studies have aimed to define its uses or functions. These include its gastroprotective function when extracted from 
 <italic>Peperomia pellucida</italic> [
 <xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>], and its toxicity against the fungus 
 <italic>Leucoagaricus gongylophorus</italic> in the control of fungus-feeding ants (Tribe Attini), an agricultural pest in the Neotropics [
 <xref rid="R83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. It is a phenylpropanoid constituted by a benzodioxole with a methyl group in the aromatic ring and an alkyl group in the side chain. The structure of this organic compound is strictly related to its function and activities [
 <xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], and when we take a wider view on its synergistic function with some other compounds (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), we observe that this same structure helps to amplify the effects of these chemical substances. This supports its potential when mixed, and not isolated. Finally, other articles cite the activity of semisynthetic derivatives of dillapiole against certain species of the genus 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> [
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and show its cytotoxic effects against a variety of tumour cells [
 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].
