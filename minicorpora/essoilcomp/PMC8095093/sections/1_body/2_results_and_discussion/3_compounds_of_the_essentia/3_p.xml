<p>According to Salehi 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (2019) [
 <xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], the 
 <italic>Piper</italic> genus is known to be a source of essential oils and 
 <italic>Piper</italic> plants may contain different EOs from several organs and tissues such as seeds, leaves, fruits, branches, stems, and roots; more than 270 identified compounds have been found in 
 <italic>Piper</italic> species. However, phytochemical studies on essential oils of different 
 <italic>Piper</italic> species have pointed out high variability in chemical composition. As mentioned by Silva 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (2017) [
 <xref rid="R93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>], studies regarding essential oil composition of different 
 <italic>Piper</italic> species found nine chemotypes characterised by 1,8-cineole, (E)-nerolidol, dillapiole and asaricin. Additionally, due to the resilient nature of the plants, the direct consequence of this biological approach is that the variability of secondary metabolism reflects the adaptation capacity of the plant to all external factors [

 <xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. This chemical evidence concerning essential oil variability is highly relevant to identify specific chemotypes that could be useful in the modern food and health products market, even though variable composition is a frequent obstacle to their use. The present review, pointing out the main constituents reported by different research, sheds light on these aspects of variability within the species.
