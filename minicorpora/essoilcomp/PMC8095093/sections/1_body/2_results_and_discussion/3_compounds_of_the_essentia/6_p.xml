<p>For EOs, variable composition is a frequent condition that makes it difficult to develop standardised batches. The choice and selection of specific chemotypes, the study of the balsamic period of the species and rigorous quality control on extraction, can partially mitigate the problem of variability, allowing production with reproducible quantities of the main components.</p>
