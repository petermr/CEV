<p>In these experiments, two methods of application were used to determine the larvicidal effect: in the first case, they applied the solutions topically to the dorsal side of the larvae, whereas in the second, to verify the residual potential of the synergistic combination, they soaked filter paper in the substance, let it dry and placed it in a Petri dish where the larvae were then situated for 24h. The concentration of dillapiole was always 71.9% and one of the chemical compounds that was used by three of the four experiments was cypermethrin and its different forms. Larvicidal activity was systematically tested. These results reinforce the conclusions pointed out by various authors [
