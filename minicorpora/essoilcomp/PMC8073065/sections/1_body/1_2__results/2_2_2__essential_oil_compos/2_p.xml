<p>Among the monoterpene hydrocarbons identified in the three periods analysed (0–7 days, 15–30 days and 100–120 days, respectively), α-pinene was the main compound (49.65%, 47.42% and 46.67%) followed by camphene (2.60%, 2.49% and 2.56%), limonene (2.08%, 1.81% and 1.52%) and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (1.47%, 1.26% and 1.33%). Considering the oxygenated monoterpenes, bornyl acetate (2.71%, 2.32% and 2.48%), followed by 
 <italic>trans</italic>-pinocarveol (1.56%, 1.59% and 0.99%) can be highlighted. With regard to the sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, alloaromadendrene (1.50%, 1.13% and 1.68%) was the main compound identified. In addition, finally, if the oxygenated sesquiterpenes are considered, viridiflorol (10.03%, 11.98% and 12.50%), followed by ledol (2.85%, 3.41% and 3.51%) were the most abundant compounds. The chemical structures of the abovementioned main compounds are shown in
