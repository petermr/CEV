<p>The storage of 
 <italic>Cistus ladanifer</italic> L. bales from mechanised harvesting during 100â€“120 days does not significantly decrease the essential oil yield. Consequently, a mechanised harvesting of this species together with the storage of the plants could be contemplated by the industry to increase the volume of harvested plants and to improve the working conditions during harvesting, compared to the traditional manual harvesting.
