<p>The plant material was obtained with a harvester baler system (BIOBALER WB55, Chesterville, QC, Canada). This equipment, powered by a 154 kW tractor (Valtra T194D, Suolahti, Finland), includes a harvester unit that cuts standing shrubs at an approximate height of 15 cm above the ground, and leads vegetation to a cylindrical baling system that compresses the biomass into round big bales. This machine was acquired in 2015 and tested with different shrub vegetation and terrain conditions in the ENERBIOSCRUB project between 2015 and 2018 [
