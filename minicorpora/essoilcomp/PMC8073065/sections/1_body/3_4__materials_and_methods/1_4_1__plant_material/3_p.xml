Then, four samples were taken from four different bales and the moisture content of the biomass was analysed following the standard ISO 18134-2:2017 (Solid biofuels—Determination of moisture content—Oven dry method—Part 2: Total moisture—Simplified method). Afterwards, the bales were stored indoors during three different periods: 1–7 days (just harvested), 15–30 days (less than one month from harvest) and 100–120 days (long storage period).</p>
