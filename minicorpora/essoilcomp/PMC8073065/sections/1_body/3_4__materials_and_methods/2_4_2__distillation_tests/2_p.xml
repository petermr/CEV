<p>A 30 litre stainless steel still and saturated steam (0.5 bar) produced in an electric boiler (ETE, Madrid, Spain) were used during the batch steam distillation tests. The steam flow was 15 kg/h and the extraction duration 30 min per sample distilled. Time was measured from the moment the first drop of distillate fell. The temperature inside the still was kept constant at 98 °C. The hydrolate and the essential oil were separated by density using a glass Florentine flask and the samples were collected in glass flasks. The essential oils were dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate. After filtration they were weighed and stored at 4 °C until further analysis. The oil yield was calculated as a percentage (weight/weight) on a biomass dry basis.</p>
