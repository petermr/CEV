<p>Ten water steam distillation tests were performed, each one corresponding to a different storage time: 1, 2, 4, 7, 15, 20, 30, 100, 110 and 120 days. Four consecutive samples of 30 mm milled 
 <italic>Cistus ladanifer</italic> (5 kg each) were distilled for each one of the tests. The essential oil obtained was accumulated and the yield was calculated for the whole distillation process. Afterwards, the essential oils corresponding to each one of the storage periods (1–7 days, 15–30 days and 100–120 days) were blended and analysed.
