<p>The essential oil components were analysed by GC (FID)-MS, using the relative area percentage. The used apparatus were Agilent HP 8890/5977 (GC-MS) and Agilent HP 8890 (GC-FID) (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), both equipped with DB-WAX UI fused silica columns (60 m × 0.25 mm inner diameter, film thickness 0.5 µm) and retention time locking. The column temperature program was 50 °C for a duration of 6 min, increase of 2 °C/min to 190 °C, then 4 °C/min increase to 220 °C, which was maintained for 10 min and, finally, 4 °C/min increase to 250 °C, which was maintained for 10 min. The carrier gas was helium at a variable flow rate and a head pressure of 30.75 psi. The injection volume was 0.1 µL and split mode injection (ratio 1:100) was employed. Injector and detector temperatures were 240 °C. GC-MS was performed with the same capillary column, carrier gas and operating conditions described for GC analysis. Mass spectra were taken over the m/z range 33–350 with an ionisation voltage of 70 eV.</p>
