<p>The composition of 
 <italic>Cistus ladanifer</italic> essential oil depends on several factors, including the origin of the plant, the season when the harvest was carried out or the oil extraction method used [

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-02379" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In this sense, different compositions have been found in literature. According to Ruiz García et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-02379" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], commercial essential oils usually show high α-pinene content, it being desirable not to exceed 30%, and sometimes using a partial removal of this component. Other major components are also shown, such as 
 <italic>trans</italic>-pinocarveol, with limits between 2.0% and 7.0%, ledene, ranging between 1.0% and 6.0% and viridiflorol, with typical values between 1.5% and 3.5%. Other authors that have analysed commercial 
 <italic>Cistus</italic> essential oils have reported results for Spanish essential oils [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-02379" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] with α-pinene (48.9–50.0%), camphene (2.4–5.0%), 2,2,6-trimethyl cyclohexanone (1.5–2.0%), bornyl acetate (1.5–3.1%), 
 <italic>trans</italic>-pinocarveol (1.7–2.8%), viridiflorol (1.1–1.7%) and ledene (1.4–3.7%) as the main compounds. The analysis of commercial Portuguese essential oils [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-02379" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] has shown the same major compounds and different limits, i.e., α-pinene (29.8–59.5%), camphene (2.6–14.7%), 2,2,6- trimethyl cyclohexanone (0.4–3.4%), bornyl acetate (2.1–6.1%), 
 <italic>trans</italic>-pinocarveol (1.8–5.9%), viridiflorol (0.8–1.9%) and ledene (0.3–4.5%). On the other hand, considering literature where parameters regarding plants, harvesting, oil extraction methods and oil analysis are studied, different compositions of the oil have been found. Therefore, very low α-pinene and camphene contents, around 2% and 0.1%, respectively [

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-02379" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], 
 <italic>trans</italic>-pinocarveol contents up to 10.9% [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-02379" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and viridiflorol contents higher than 15% [

 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-02379" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] are reported in some of the samples analysed. On the other hand, especially high globulol values [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-02379" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], between 3.1% and 5.0%, 1–8 cineole values (19.3%) [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-02379" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], γ-terpinene (6.1%) [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-02379" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and γ-gurjunene (14.6%) [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-02379" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] are shown in some of the studies.
