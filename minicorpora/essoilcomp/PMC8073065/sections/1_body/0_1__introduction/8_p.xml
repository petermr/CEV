<p>The most used technique to obtain essential oils on an industrial scale is steam distillation. As far as we know, very few studies on distillation of 
 <italic>Cistus ladanifer</italic> on an industrial scale have been published. Typical yield values between 0.1% and 0.3% have been reported by Ruiz García et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-02379" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and some industrial producers consulted (Biolandes and El Jarpil) consider that a common yield value with fresh biomass is close to 0.1%. Experiences carried out in steam distillation pilot plants have also been poorly published, with yield values between 0.01% and 0.04% obtained with 100 kg of plants in a stainless steel distiller of 1100 L during 1.5 h at 0.5 bar [
