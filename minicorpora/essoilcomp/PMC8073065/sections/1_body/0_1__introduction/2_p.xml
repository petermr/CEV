 <italic>Cistus ladanifer</italic> grows on sunny, acidic siliceous soils, at altitudes usually below 1000 m and the plant is generally between 1 and 2 m high [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-26-02379" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In the Mediterranean region, it has dominant nature, with adaptation to extreme environmental factors such as the ability to survive in low hydric and high solar exposition conditions [

 <xref rid="B4-molecules-26-02379" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-02379" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Moreover, it is a pyrophyte plant [

 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-02379" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and often forms dense scrub communities that produce phytotoxic compounds (likely allelopathic) that may have inhibitory effects on the herbaceous understorey [

 <italic>Cistus ladanifer</italic> can eliminate competition and become a colonising species. It usually covers great areas of burnt degraded forests, abandoned pastures and crops in Spain, Portugal, south of France and north of Morocco [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-02379" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The biggest extensions of 
 <italic>Cistus ladanifer</italic> wild shrublands can be found in Spain where, according to recent estimations, the species is present in more than 2 million hectares and is dominant in a little more than 460,000 ha [
