<p>Although the typical product obtained from the plant is the labdanum gum, other products can be produced from 
 <italic>Cistus ladanifer</italic>. Labdanum gum can be obtained by immersion of the aerial parts of the plant in warm carbonated water followed by acidification of the medium [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-02379" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This method is widely used in small artisanal devices and in some small processing factories in Southern Spain [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-02379" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and currently the total estimated annual production of labdanum gum varies between 200 and 600 t/year (communication from the company Biolandes), with six companies registered in the REACH [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-02379" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. If the labdanum gum is distilled, labdanum oil is obtained. On the contrary, if the gum undergoes an alcoholic extraction followed by concentration, labdanum resinoid is produced. The plant exudates can also be extracted using solvents. Therefore, the 
 <italic>Cistus</italic> concrete is produced by solvent extraction of the plant aerial parts and subsequent elimination of the solvent by concentration of the extract, and the 
 <italic>Cistus</italic> absolute is obtained by washing the concrete with ethanol, followed by filtration to eliminate the waxes and concentration of the alcoholic phase [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-02379" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Finally, 
 <italic>Cistus</italic> essential oil and hydrolate (also referred to as hydrosol or floral water), are obtained by hydrodistillation or steam distillation of the leaves and stems. The essential oil yields are very low and the current market prices may exceed 400 €/kg [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-02379" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The global production of essential oil is estimated to be between 1 and 10 t/year, considering the result of a consultation with the only producer registered in the REACH with more than 1 t/year [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-02379" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] (Biolandes), although higher estimations (50–100 t/year) have been made in the literature consulted [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-02379" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It must also be noted that, although a significant part of the essential oil is produced in small steam distillation plants, the quantity of 50 t/year should require at least an annual plant harvest of more than 50,000 t only for steam distillation, and this is not realistic according to the consulted companies (Biolandes and El Jarpil).
