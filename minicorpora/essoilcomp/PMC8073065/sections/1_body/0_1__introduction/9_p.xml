<p>The low yields obtained during 
 <italic>Cistus ladanifer</italic> distillation in the industry entail the use of large quantities of biomass whose harvesting is usually carried out during a short period of time, from July to October [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-26-02379" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The plants are currently manually harvested, this being very hard work as it is performed during the hottest days. Teams of harvesters cut the twigs using a sickle, bundle them up and pile them into cars and horse-drawn carts. Since the harvesting period is short, peaks of worker demand can be too high to be covered by the labour market. In this sense, mechanised harvesting could cause considerable improvements in the collection of this biomass, increasing the volume of harvested plants and improving the working conditions. However, the mechanised harvesting of rockrose is a complex matter mainly due to the stickiness of the plant.
