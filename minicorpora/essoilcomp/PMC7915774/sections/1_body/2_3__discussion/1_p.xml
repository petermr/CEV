<p>Our approach focuses on implementation of a novel extraction method for isolation of terpenes from plant oil. Extraction of volatile compounds by VASE is an example of sorbent-based extraction, with all of the consequences, including different partition coefficients of analytes and sorbent (Tenax); therefore, different profiles compared to hydrodistillation, and eventual compounds displacement on the surface of the sorbent. Taking into consideration the specificity of the VASE technique, compared to purge and trap the sorbent absorbes analytes in a different way: they are not swept by the stream of inert gas through the sorbent tube, but thanks to the unique construction of Sorbent Pens, they are adsorbed mainly in the initial portion of the sorbent. This allows for rapid desorption without the need for cryofocussing. The sorption process is attained by vacuum, so the air is evacuated from the vial, and after air evacuation, the valve prevents the loss of vacuum. The behavior of compounds in this type of extraction is time dependent. Though the sum of volatiles increased throughout the whole extraction process (comparing 3 min with 20 min,

For β-pinene, o-cymene, γ-terpinene, linalool, and camphor, their peak areas decreased during extraction (when 3 min and 20 min were compared). For the remaining compounds, their peak areas increased throughout extraction.

Such behavior of terpenes was also observed in the extraction process using SPME, where polymer based fiber coatings, as well as absorption type of coating (PDMS) were used for the extraction of terpenes from black pepper. It was especially noticeable when the profile of mono- and sesquiterpenes were compared during long extraction times (up to 120 min) [
