<p>Coriander essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation (6 h) from seeds (2.2% yield) revealed 53 compounds, where linalool was the main compound (75.30%) [

Monoterpene hydrocarbons prevailed in pericarp (26.29%) compared to seed (1.50%), which resulted in 5.41% of monoterpene hydrocarbons in whole fruit. Monoterpene alcohols, which assumed 95.13% in seeds, reached 39.90% in pericarp, which made 89.66% in whole fruit [

 <xref rid="B17-molecules-26-00884" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] reported significant changes in the composition of essential oils extracted from the fruits of coriander, depending on the stages of maturity, where linalool was the dominant compound in all ripening stages ranging from 36.69% in the first stage to 72.35% in the fourth stage. Interestingly, geranyl acetate, which amounted 35.17% in the first stage of development dropped down to 1.49% in the last stage [
