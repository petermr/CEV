<p>Hydrodistillation provides volatile compounds representing essential oils devoid of non-volatile constituents that might be transferred to samples during classical liquid/liquid or liquid/solid extraction. During prolonged (2–6 h) boiling in water, essential oils are evaporated and either directly trapped in organic solvent (simultaneous distillation extraction) or condensed as total oil. Thermal stability of essential oil constituents is an important issue, as terpenes may undergo various changes during prolonged heating. Therefore, hydrodistillation is not the most appropriate isolation method for some plant material (citrus fruit, flowers). As terpenes are unsaturated compounds, they may undergo changes during prolonged boiling. This refers especially to monoterpene alcohols, such as linalool, nerol, geraniol, and α-terpineol. As demonstrated by Rettberg et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-00884" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] linalool during hydrodistillation can form several pyran and furan oxidized derivatives. In addition, terpene alcohols are prone to acid catalyzed isomerization, and linalool can yield α-terpineol. Moreover, geraniol can be transformed to nerol (and vice versa) and to linalool. In a steam distillation model, a decrease in linalool was noted, with subsequent hydroxyl-linalool derivatives and linalool oxides formation. No such derivatives were observed by us in hydrodistilled coriander oil, though linalool was the main terpene detected in it.
