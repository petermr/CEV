<p>Extraction methods greatly influenced the profile of essential oil. When four extraction techniques were compared for coriander oil (2 h hydrodistillation, 5 h Soxhlet extraction (methylene chloride), 4 h supercritical fluid extraction (SFE, CO
 <sub>2</sub>), and 20 min subcritical water extraction (SWE) extract yield varied, as other groups of compounds could be co-extracted by some of the methods (Soxhlet, SWE). The content of main compounds—linalool, γ-terpinene, camphor, or geraniol—varied substantially, depending on the technique [

Subcritical water extraction compared to hydrodistillation and Soxhlet extraction revealed similar percentages of linalool (82.91%, 77.97%, and 79.62%, respectively,) but for geranyl acetate, varied greatly (0.22%, 2.12%, and 4.36%, respectively) [

 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-00884" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] compared lavender oil profiles obtained using hydrodistillation (at pH 7.0) with that of extraction and gas phase stripping, the percentage composition of extracted linalool changed from 40.91% in hydrodistillation to 24.95% and 25.78% for extraction and stripping, respectively. On the other hand, linalyl acetate changed from 13.26% to 42.98% and 40.17% for the mentioned extraction techniques. Some of the compounds were detectable only in hydrodistillation (α-terpineol). As concluded [
