<p>VASE can be used for profiling volatile compounds; however, it can also be used for quantitative analyses, bearing in mind the partition coefficient nature of extraction. With direct analysis (injection) of essential oils, an approximation can be assumed regarding response factors of particular compounds, especially when quantitation is made using an flame ionization (FID) detector. In case of headspace analysis, calibration should be performed for every analyte using separate standards. For quantitation of constituents of coriander oil, the following eight standards were used: α-pinene, camphene, β-pinene, α-terpinene, γ-terpinene, terpinolene, β-linalool, and camphor. Standard curves were prepared in refined rapeseed oil in a concentration range of 0.32–10.4 g/L. Calibration curves were linear in this range (R
 <sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.994) for all compounds but α-terpinene, for which the logarithmic curve was created (

For compounds quantified using standard curves, the following concentrations were obtained (g/L of coriander cold pressed oil): α-pinene—6.50 ± 0.54; camphene—1.91 ± 0.31; β-pinene—4.89 ± 0.65; α-terpinene—3.17 ± 0.26; γ-terpinene—4.61 ± 0.43; terpinolene—0.92 ± 0.16; β-linalool—43.55 ± 4.28; and camphor—1.70 ± 0.26. For quantified compounds, no LODs were estimated, as the sensitivity of the method is not an issue when analyzing, at least, the main terpenes in coriander oil. However, for samples representing 0.020 g/L of each analyte, the s/n ratios for TIC ranged between 14 (camphene and γ-terpinene) and 36 (α-terpinene). Moreover, repeatability for all compounds that were measured as TIC peak areas of particular identified compounds was generally &lt; 10% relative standard deviation (RSD) for all compounds. These results show the potential of the method; however, analysis of all detected compounds using their standards would provide a complete picture of the method’s quantitative performance.
