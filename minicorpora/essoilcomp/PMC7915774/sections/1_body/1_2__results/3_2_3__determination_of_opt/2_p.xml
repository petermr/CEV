<p>In the first step, an optimal sample size was chosen after analysis of 2000 mg, 1000 mg, and 200 mg samples. Analyses were initially run for 20 min at the temperature of 60 °C for various sample sizes. Chromatograms illustrating extraction parameters are shown in the 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-00884">supplementary files (Figures S1–S3)</xref>. From the initial conditions, a sample size of 200 mg was chosen for further experiments (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-00884">Figure S1</xref>). Decreasing further sample sizes may result in worse repeatability and reproducibility. In the next step, the temperature of extraction was checked, and from the initial ones tested (60 °C, 40 °C, and 20 °C), the last one was chosen, based on the quality of chromatograms (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-00884">Figure S2</xref>). The choice of temperature is highly dependent on the compounds (which are subjects of extraction). The coriander terpenes consisted mainly of monoterpene hydrocarbons, as well as monoterpene alcohols, among which, linalool dominated. As can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00884-f002">Figure 2</xref>, temperature had a significant effect on the extraction of analyzed terpenes from coriander oil. The total peak area was almost three times higher for 60 °C compared to 20 °C. The most significant difference, in terms of compound identification, was noted for two compounds with very low volatility—geraniol and geranyl acetate. Their peak areas were approximately four times bigger for 60 °C extraction compared to 20 °C extraction (
