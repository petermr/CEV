<p>VASE is a sorbent-based technique and requires experimental elaboration of optimal extraction parameters, which would allow for sufficient sensitivity and separation of extracted compounds. For the selection of best extraction parameters, various sample sizes, extraction temperatures, as well as extraction times were tested. For the analysis of terpenes in coriander oil, the sensitivity was not an issue, as the amount of terpenes is very high in this oil. The majority of the problems were related to column overloading and insufficient peak separation, as the VASE desorption unit used a constant split frit.</p>
