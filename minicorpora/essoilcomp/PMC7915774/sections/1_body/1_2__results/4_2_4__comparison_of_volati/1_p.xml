<p>Hydrodistillation is a standard extraction method for isolation of essential oils from plants and was used in almost all references on coriander essential oils research. For our analytical purposes, VASE was performed from cold pressed oil obtained from coriander fruit. To relate the results obtained using VASE with hydrodistillation results, the latter process was performed for cold pressed oil. Oil and water mixture (1:4) was subjected to hydrodistillation in a Deryng apparatus for 2 h, which allowed collection of essential oil for comparison.

 <xref rid="molecules-26-00884-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> show terpene profile comparison of hydrodistilled compounds vs. those obtained by VASE extraction. The most striking difference is the high percentage (%) amount of β-linalool in hydrodistilled oil compared to VASE (almost 45% compared to 23–27%). Moreover, other monoterpene alcohol—geraniol and its acetate—was in higher concentration in hydrodistilled oil. Camphor, with the vapor pressure of 0.22 mmHg and logP value of 2.38, was also extracted with more efficiency using hydrodistillation. On the other hand, for almost all monoterpene hydrocarbons (with the exception of α-pinene) their percentage (%) amount in VASE extracts was higher than for hydrodistillation. For some compounds, the differences were 2-fold (sylvestrene) up to 10-fold (allo-ocimene). Interestingly, structurally related isomers of α-pinene and β-pinene behaved differently in both types of extraction. Data on comparison of terpene profiles in
