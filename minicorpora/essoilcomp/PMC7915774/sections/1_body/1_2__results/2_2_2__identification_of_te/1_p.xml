<p>The characteristic aromatic feature of coriander cold pressed oil is its unique aroma. The aroma of coriander oil is associated with a high amount of terpenes present in it, which are transferred to the oil during pressing. VASE allowed for extraction of terpenes present in coriander oil. Due to the nature of the matrix (oil composed mainly of triglycerides), headspace analysis, such as VASE, is the most convenient (and fastest) type of analysis to identify (and quantify) volatiles in it. Typical total ion chromatogram (TIC) obtained using VASE is presented on 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00884-f001">Figure 1</xref>. A total of 17 main terpenes were identified using VASE extraction at 20 °C. The most abundant compound extracted was β-linalool, which was 23.05% of the total peak area (

Eight compounds were identified based on their retention indices and mass spectra compared to NIST 02 library, and for nine terpenes, authentic standards were used for their identity confirmation (
