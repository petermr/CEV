<p>Oil was obtained from coriander fruit and was pressed using a screw press at temperatures not exceeding 40 °C, under nitrogen atmosphere. Oil used in the experiments was characterized by a peroxide value of 2.86 ± 0.3 meq O2/kg, free fatty acids (FFA) = 2.0 mg KOH/g, and the following fatty acids methyl esters (FAME) profile: C16:0–3.89% (

As the column used for FAME analysis was not able to resolve oleic acid methyl ester (C18:1 n-9) from petroselinic acid (C18:1 n-12), both isomers were listed under C18:1. The characteristics of cold pressed coriander oil fulfilled the regulations on novel foods, Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2165, except for the exceeded stearic acid contents (1.65% instead of &lt;1.5%).
