<p>The life cycle of 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasite begins with the bite of infected female phlebotomine sandflies and is completed in two different morphological forms, that is, promastigote and amastigote. Flagellated metacyclic promastigote, formed in the infected sandflies firstly enter into the macrophages via phagocytosis and formed phagosome. Resultant phagosome enter into the stages of maturation (membrane transformation) and formed a new structure: the parasitophorous vacuole. In this organelle, promastigotes metamorphose into amastigote, followed by its multiplication until explosion of the cells of the macrophage system (4–6°days) spreads infection further. The parasite either initiates infection superficial cells or visceral cell depending on its tropism characteristics. The life cycle of 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> into the host is completed when another uninfected sandfly sucks blood as a source of meal. The sensitivity of infection is based on the sandfly species, ecology, epidemiology, and pathogenicity (
