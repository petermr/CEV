<p>Chemotherapy due to lack of effective therapies till date has become the only choice in treating leishmaniasis, as these therapies exhibit higher toxicity levels, treatment cost, and resistance development against leishmanial parasites, and encourage other side effects. In addition, it is evident that the efficiency of drugs varies from species to species due to leishmanial antigen variants and different immunological responses against the drug. To overcome these challenges, biogenic nanomaterials being nontoxic, bio-compatible, cost effective, and having high targeted drug-loading potentials have been indicated as beneficial alternatives to formulate nanovaccines. Targeted drug delivery barriers can be conquered by using nanoformulations for enhanced parasiticidal proficiencies. Also, various studies have demonstrated leishmanicidal activities of plant-derived natural compounds (such as berberine, 7, 8-dihydroxyflavone, E-caryophyllene, essential oil constituents, Î±-terpineol, glycosides, tannins, and anthraquinone flavonoids), which can further integrate beneficial outcomes. Besides, most of the studies conducted on leishmanicidal activities revealed only the basic outcomes like assessment of the effect of test drugs (crude extract, isolated bioactive compounds, essential oil, and purified fraction) on the parasite growth. Few of them identify the proper formulation as well as the effect on the promastigote stage, found in the sandflies (vector). As widely conferred in the literature, plants possess a variety of bioactive compounds, and most of them have been reported for their pharmaceutical properties. Thus, the standardization may conclude the identification of particular compound responsible for leishmanicidal activities. Biosynthesized nanoparticles majorly eliminate the infection either by triggering the immunomodulatory response of the host or sometimes directly by resulting in vacuolization of parasitic cells, leading to parasite killing. Nanovaccines are a relatively new concept in treating

Although nanotechnology has provided a hope toward improved and successful eradication of neglected tropical diseases, the accurate molecular mechanism responsible still needs thorough transparency to bring utmost benefits.
