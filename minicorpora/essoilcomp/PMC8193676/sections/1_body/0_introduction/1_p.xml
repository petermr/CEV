<p>Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are contagious diseases that cause substantial illness in more than one billion people globally (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Maheshwari and Bandyopadhyay, 2020</xref>). Various parasite-mediated diseases comprising giardiasis, Chagas disease, Babesiosis, toxoplasmosis, leishmaniasis, 
 <italic>etc.</italic>, befall in animals and further spread to human population (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Oryan, 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Hotez et al., 2020</xref>). Leishmaniasis is one of the NTDs considered as imperative parasitic diseases, commonly caused by an etiologic agent 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic>, a genus of trypanosomes. Leishmaniasis is located in the ninth place of the global burden of disease among individual infectious diseases. More than 22 species of infectious 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> have been reported (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Maheshwari and Bandyopadhyay, 2020</xref>). 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> are transmitted to mammals through the bite of infected female sandflies belonging to 
 <italic>Lutzomyia</italic> and 
 <italic>Phlebotomus</italic> (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Oryan and Akbari, 2016</xref>). It is endemic in 98 nations of the world, where more than 350 million people are at risk and more than 12 million cases of infection have been reported (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Verma and Dey, 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Mcgwire and Satoskar, 2014</xref>). Based on the species and intensity of infection to the host, it has been classified into cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL), and visceral leishmaniasis (VL) forms. Considering these classes, CL caused 
 <italic>by L. aethiopica</italic> is most commonly found in human population and reported to infect 6,00,000 to one million people annually all around the world. It causes severe symptoms like ulcers, serious disabilities, and life-long marks (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">Surur et al., 2020</xref>). Previously, various chemical drugs including liposomal amphotericin B, amphotericin B, pentamidine, pentavalent antimonials, miltefosine, and paromomycin have been practiced against 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic>. Among these drugs, pentavalent antimonials (sodium stibogluconate and meglumine) are existing chemical drugs, and they are a major therapeutic source to treat 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection. However, current treatment practices are associated with certain side effects like high toxicity, high cost, and most importantly, development of drug resistance. Hence, there is an instantaneous necessity to innovate new, harmless, and efficient prevention therapies to overcome these limitations (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Mitropoulos et al., 2010</xref>). Currently, various approaches are involved to control the elevated level of infection, including nanoformulations and targeted drug delivery using nanocarriers as well as with the aid of particular bioactive compound obtained from plants (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Javed et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Santana et al., 2020</xref>). Inventions in nanoscience greatly contribute to overcome the problems allied with the treatment of infectious diseases. Owing to the small size of NPs (1–100 nm), the ability to penetrate easily into the cells, extensive circulation within the body, and the efficient targeted drug delivery system, they can be reflected as a better medication to treat endemic leishmaniasis (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Ebrahimi et al., 2017</xref>). Further, plant-based nanoparticles have been reported as a successful approach for the preclusion of microbial infections as well as in the treatment of leishmaniasis (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Alti et al., 2020</xref>). Owing to the green and eco-friendly nature, cost effectiveness, less hazardous nature, and involvement of phytoconstituents for capping and stabilization, plant-based metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) (silver, zinc, nickel, iron, 
 <italic>etc.</italic>) have been in use to cure leishmanial infection (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Ismail et al., 2019</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Alti et al., 2020</xref>). The present review focuses on the use of plant-based natural products, the phytosynthesized NPs, to cure
