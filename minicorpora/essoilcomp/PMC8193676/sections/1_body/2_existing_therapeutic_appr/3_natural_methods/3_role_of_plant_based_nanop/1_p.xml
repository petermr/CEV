<p>Methods in controlling infectious diseases have modernized translational sciences to develop a better controlling method for infectious diseases. The field of nanomedicine has shown enormous potential in developing highly sensitive diagnostic tools with excellent drug delivery properties. Recently, nanoparticle-conjugated drugs have increasingly been studied as an alternative, cost-effective therapy with increased effectiveness. However, toxicity is a major barrier that needs to be encountered. Several reports have shown the effective antimicrobial activities of various metal/metal oxide nanoparticles as well as against the
