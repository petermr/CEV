<p>Besides, the nanostructured drug delivery system was also reported in ameliorate NTDs including leishmaniasis. Furthermore, crude plant extracts and precise phytoconstituents obtained from plant which is involved in the prevention mechanism were also loaded in the nanostructured drug delivery system and used as a therapeutic source to cure leishmaniasis, and the mechanism is depicted below:

   <p>• Liposome NPs consisting of phospholipids are assisted as a transport system for the delivery of hydrophilic as well as lipophilic pharmaceutical drugs (
    <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Momeni et al., 2013</xref>). They provide improved pharmacokinetic assets along with target diligence which offers a foremost advantage (
    <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Kaye and Scott, 2011</xref>). Liposome can spear the macrophages through phagocytosis and offers direct delivery of the drugs at their targeted sites. Different drug formulations including AmB colloidal formulations, liposomal AmB, and AmB lipid network can overwhelm the toxic effects of conventional drugs (

    <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> and 
    <italic>Combretum leprosum</italic> extracts were also reported for their antileishmanial properties (

   <p>• 8-hydroxyquinoline with the polymeric micelle encapsulation method has been used to treat 
    <italic>Leishmania</italic> (
    <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Duarte et al., 2016</xref>). Berberin, an isoquinoline alkaloid extracted from medicinal plants, has been reported to possess various biologic properties, including antileishmanial properties. A previous study addressed the preparation of BER-loaded liposomes with the aim to prevent its rapid liver metabolism and improve the drug selective delivery to the infected organs in visceral leishmaniasis (VL) (
