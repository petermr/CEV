<p>Nanoparticles synthesized using crude as well as various solvent-fractionated extracts of medically important plants are considered as efficient agents for the delivery of specific phytoconstituents into the cells. Keeping in view the effective antimicrobial activities of silver metal, silver/silver oxide NPs have been synthesized using a variety of medicinally important plant species, including 
 <italic>Mentha arvensis</italic> L., 
 <italic>Ficus benghalensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Cuminum cyminum</italic>, 
 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic>, 
 <italic>Silybum marianum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Sechium edule</italic>, at a dosage of 10, 300, 0.5, 246, and 51.88 μg/ml tested against 
 <italic>L. tropica</italic>, 
 <italic>L. donovani</italic>,

 <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic>, respectively (
