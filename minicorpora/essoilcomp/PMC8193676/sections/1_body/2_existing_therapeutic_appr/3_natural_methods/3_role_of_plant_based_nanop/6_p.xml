<p>As per the literature survey, plant-based nanoparticles contribute efficient roles in the treatment of leishmaniasis as compared to other existing practices. Phytosynthesized NPs revealed an identical effect on the inhibition of parasitic growth at a comparatively lesser concentration than the prescribed dose of Amp B to cure this disease. Additionally, bimetallic nanoparticles including Au−Ag, Zn−Ag, and Ti−Ag were synthesized using the green approach and proficiently used as a therapeutic source to treat leishmaniasis (
