<p>Several 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> findings suggest leishmanicidal effects of bioâ€“Ag-NPs by direct (exclusive of inflammatory mediators) or indirect (immunomodulatory) mechanisms (

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Calvo et al., 2020</xref>). In the direct method, metal-NPs kill the parasitic cells by causing vacuolation inside parasites and damage to the cellular membrane without generating immunomodulatory intermediaries, that is, reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), and apoptotic and necrotic factors (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Fanti et al., 2018</xref>). In situations when 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites override the oxidative burst inside phagocytic cells and reside in phagolysosomes, nanoformulations assist site-specific delivery and accumulation of drugs, which is responsible for parasite killing (

 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Fanti et al. (2018)</xref>, Ag-NPs after diffusion through the cellular membranes get oxidized due to acidic conditions within the phagolysosomes, and eventually, the release of free Ag + ions causes parasite assassination.
