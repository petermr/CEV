<p>On the other hand, the indirect method involves immunomodulatory response generation at infection sites. Other ways to provide leishmanicidal effects are through activating immune response mediators in which the cell viability and proliferation get declined as an effect of metallic nanoparticles. NPs basically induce different morphological abrasions such as distorted membranal integrity, cytotoxicity, mitochondrial destruction, cell cycle arrest (G1), increased/decreased ROS and NO generation, affected enzymatic activities, and release of apoptotic or necrotic factors (
