<p>The results of antimicrobial effect of 
 <italic>T. pulegioides</italic> α-TA essential oil and pure α-TA are presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-01065-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>. According to all investigated microorganisms results, the growth inhibition was the weakest of both bacteria by α-TA essential oil and pure α-TA. The obtained MIC values were from 31.3 µg/mL to 125 µg/mL. Using MIC values of 0.02 µg/mL of α-TA essential very good effect especially on 
 <italic>T. mentagrophytes</italic> and 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> was observed. 
 <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> and 
 <italic>T. rubrum</italic> were sensitive to the α-TA essential oil MIC concentration of 0.4 µg/mL. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) data obtained by the microdilution method revealed significant activity of pure α-TA against the 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> and 
 <italic>T. rubrum</italic> when concentration of 0.4 µg/mL was used. Though, for 
 <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> and 
 <italic>T. mentagrophytes</italic> MIC of 1.6 µg/mL was required. α-TA essential oil inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> at concentrations of 31.3 µg/mL while the pure α-TA inhibited both microorganisms only with the concentration of 125 µg/mL. The same trend was observed for 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida</italic> yeasts where the MFCs values were ranging from 6.3 µg/mL to 125 µg/mL of α-TA essential oil and pure α-TA, respectively. The study of MFC showed that α-TA essential oil has a 3.9 times stronger antimicrobial effect on 
 <italic>T. mentagrophytes</italic> than pure α-TA. According to MFCs (minimum fungicidal concentrations) values, the antimicrobial effect of a pure α-TA on tested microorganisms was similar to α-TA essential oil values (except for dermatophytes).
