 <italic>Thymus pulegioides</italic> α-terpinyl acetate chemotype essential oil, which was used for further phytotoxic and antimicrobial investigations. The monoterpenes (87.27%) amounted main fraction of this essential oil. Oxygene monoterpene α-TA was dominant compound. The second compound was monoterpene alcohol α-terpineol; moreover, its percentage in essential oil was 4.5 time lower than α-TA (
