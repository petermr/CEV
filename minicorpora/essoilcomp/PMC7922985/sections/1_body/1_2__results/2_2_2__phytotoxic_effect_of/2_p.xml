<p>α-TA essential oil especially strong negatively influenced on seeds germination and radicles growth of 
 <italic>P. pratensis</italic>: all investigated germination parameters and radicles length were different (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) comparing to control (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-01065-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-01065-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). The phytotoxic effect was the strongest through water leading to 0.7% germinated seeds of 
 <italic>P. pratensis</italic>. Furthermore, the radicles were 50 times shorter than control. Inhibition effect of α-TA essential oil and pure α-TA on germination of monocotyledon 
 <italic>Phleum pratense</italic> was also weaker. However, only essential oil effect through air, which reduced 
 <italic>P. pratense</italic> seeds germination by 8%, was statistically significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) when comparing with control. 
 <italic>P. pratense</italic> radicles length was significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) different when comparing to control. The strongest inhibition radicles length effect of α-TA essential oil was found through air. 
 <italic>P. pratense</italic> radicles grew up 1.5 times longer when seeds were exposed to pure α-TA through water.
