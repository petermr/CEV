<p>In many European countries phenolic chemotypes thymol and carvacrol were found in 
 <italic>T. pulegioides</italic> [

 <xref rid="B31-molecules-26-01065" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-26-01065" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, there is still not enough research has been done about the occurrence of α-TA chemotype in 
 <italic>T. pulegioides</italic>. A. Michet with co-authors demonstrated that α-TA was dominant compound in essential oils of 
 <italic>T. pulegioides,</italic> which is growing wild in subalpine zone at 1700 m in France; interestingly, it was observed that α-TA chemotype was not growing in habitats where phenolic chemotypes were growing [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-01065" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. D. Mockutė and G. Bernotienė found α-TA chemotype in 
 <italic>T. pulegioides</italic> in Vilnius region of Lithuania [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-01065" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Investigations in the east and south-east of Lithuania showed that only 39% of α-TA was found in natural habitats of 
 <italic>T. pulegioides</italic>, and it was demonstrated that mobile phosphorus in soil was showing positive effect on content of α-TA in 
 <italic>T. pulegioides</italic> [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-26-01065" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In western Lithuania, marine climate is more dominant while in the eastern part, the continental climate is more apparent [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-01065" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Therefore, different climatic conditions in Lithuania could influence α-TA occurrence in 
 <italic>T. pulegioides.</italic>
