<p>One of the principal public health problems is drug resistance among bacteria and fungi. The treatment of fungal infections, especially caused by 
 <italic>Trichophyton</italic>, 
 <italic>Candida</italic>, and 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species, is most challenging due to its toxicity and side effects of used drugs [

 <xref rid="B43-molecules-26-01065" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in research and development of new antimicrobial drugs from different sources to prevent microbial resistance. One of the options to help overcome different bacterial or fungal infections could be natural treatment [
