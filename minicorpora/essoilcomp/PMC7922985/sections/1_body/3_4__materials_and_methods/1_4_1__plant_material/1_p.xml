<p>To estimate α-TA occurrence in 
 <italic>T. pulegioides</italic>, there were investigated 131 different habitats of this species in Lithuania (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01065-f002">Figure 2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-01065">Table S1</xref>). The aerial parts of 
 <italic>T. pulegioides</italic> have been separately collected from each habitat in July (during the full flowering stage) in the following way: same selected mass of aerial part of 
 <italic>T. pulegioides</italic> was cut from each individual plant growing in the habitat and mixed. The weight was selected depending on each habitat abundance and/or size of individual plants in the habitat: 10 g of aerial part from each individual plant of 
 <italic>T. pulegioides</italic> was cut in abundant/big habitats, but only 30–50 g was cut in small habitats. The aerial parts of plants were dried at room temperature over 4–5 days.
