<p>Seeds of 
 <italic>P. pratensis, P. pratense, T. pratense</italic>, and 
 <italic>Hypericum perforatum</italic> L. were bought in JSC Agrofirma “Sėklos” (Lithuania). Seeds of 
 <italic>T. pulegioides</italic> were collected at the Field Experimental Station of the Nature Research Centre, Vilnius, Lithuania. The effect of essential oils of 
 <italic>T. pulegioides</italic> α-TA chemotype and analytical standard α-TA on germination and growth of radicles of 
 <italic>P. pratensis, P. pratense, T. pratense H. perforatum</italic>, and 
 <italic>T. pulegioides</italic> were investigated through air and water. The investigation through air was carried out as following: the filter paper was moistened with 15 mL of distilled water and placed in Petri dish; the small aluminum containers with 3 μL pure essential oil or pure analytical standard was placed in center of Petri dish (on the moistened filter paper), thus only aerial contact was allowed between allelochemicals and seeds. In parallel with these experiments were performed controls with distillated water only. The investigation through water was carried out as following: the filter paper was moistened with 3 μL essential oil or analytical standard dissolved in 1% of Tween 20 and placed in Petri dish. 100 seeds were overspread gradually in each Petri dish; the borders of Petri dishes were closed with adhesive tape, to preserve the volatile compounds inside, and stored at room temperature. In parallel with these experiments were performed controls with distillated water only. Every treatment was carried out three times. Every experiment day the germinated seeds were calculated. The experiment was finished when the seeds ceased to germinate. The total number of germination seeds was calculated after experiment and recalculated to the final germination percentage (GP). Mean daily germination (MDG) index of daily germination was calculated from the following equation MDG = GP/d, where GP—the final germination percentage, d—days to the maximum of final germination. Germination index (GI) was calculated as follows: GI = Σ G
 <sub>t</sub>/T
 <sub>t</sub>, where G
 <sub>t</sub>—the number of seeds germinated of day t, T
 <sub>t</sub> —the number of days at the beginning of the experiment. After experiment radicles were measured in each Petri dish (30 radicles per treatment) to establish the radicles length (RL).
