<p>The essential oil was isolated from each mix (as described above one mix represented the raw material of one 
 <italic>T. pulegioides</italic> habitat) separately using 2 h’ hydrodistillation with Clevenger apparatus [
 <xref rid="B69-molecules-26-01065" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. For further investigations essential oil solutions of 1% were prepared in the mixture of diethyl ether and 
 <italic>n</italic>-pentane (1:1). Essential oils analysis was based on a GC-2010 Plus instrument equipped with a GC-QP 2010 Plus (Shimadzu) series mass selective detector in the electron impact ionization mode at 70 eV. Separation of compounds was performed on fused silica (100% dimethyl polysiloxane) column (30 m × 0.25 mm ID × 0.25 µm film thickness) (Restek, Bellefonte, PA, USA), splitless injection; helium as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.6 mL/min, injector and detector temperatures 250 °C. GC oven temperature program: initial temperature of 50 °C (isothermal for 7 min) was increased to 250 °C at the rate of 4 °C/min to (isothermal for 5 min) and further increased at the rate of 30 °C/min to 300 °C, the final temperature kept for 2 min. Identification of the investigated compounds was based on the comparison of retention indices (RIs) [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-26-01065" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], computer mass spectra library (NBS75K) and analytical standards of α-TA, α-terpinene, p-cymene, limonene, γ-terpinene, linalool, nerol, geraniol, β-caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide, carvacrol, thymol (Sigma-Aldrich, Schnelldorf, Germany). The retention indices were determined relative to the retention times of a series of n-alkanes (C7–C30) with linear interpolation. The quantitative analysis was performed using a FOCUS GC (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector (FID) on the silica capillary column TR-5MS (30 m × 0.25 mm ID × 0.25 μm film thickness) (Thermo Electron Corporation, Waltham, MA, USA) under the same chromatographic conditions. The percentage amounts of the investigated compounds were recalculated according to the areas of the FID chromatographic peaks assuming that all constituents of the essential oil comprise 100%. Only carvacrol, thymol, geraniol, linalool, and α-TA identification was determined from plant material collected from natural habitats.
