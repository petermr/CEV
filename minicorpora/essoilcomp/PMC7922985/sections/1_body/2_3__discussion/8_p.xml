<p>Effect of α-TA essential oil on investigated fungi 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> and 
 <italic>Trichophyton</italic> was very strong exhibiting even better effect than control itraconazole on these microorganisms. In previous studies very strong antifungal effect even at low concentrations of 0.25–1.0 μL/mL for 
 <italic>Thymus tosevii</italic> essential oil was observed, in which α-TA amount was only 12.3% [
 <xref rid="B65-molecules-26-01065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Our analysis with α-TA analytical standard confirmed that such strong antifungal effect of α-TA essential oil could be attributed to the presence of high amount of α-TA and, possibly, the presence of other bioactive chemical compounds such as α-terpineol, geraniol, α-terpinene (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-01065-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Antimicrobial activities of α-terpineol and geraniol on different microorganisms were also described in other studies [

 <xref rid="B68-molecules-26-01065" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Interestingly, in our studies, 
 <italic>Candida</italic> yeasts were generally more resistant to α-TA essential oil α-TA than fungi and dermatophytes. Though, only 
 <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> showed higher sensitivity to them than to itraconazole.
