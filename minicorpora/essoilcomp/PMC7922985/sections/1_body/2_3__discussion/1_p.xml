<p>Studies of 
 <italic>T. pulegioides</italic> habitats in Lithuania demonstrated infrequent occurrence of α-TA in this species among five main compounds such as carvacrol, thymol, geraniol, linalool, and α-TA. This compound was found only in one-third of investigated 
 <italic>T. pulegioides</italic> habitats. Additionally, only in 4.5% of investigated habitats amount of α-TA was higher than 5%. Previously studies in Lithuania also demonstrated rarity of this chemical compound. Investigation done in east and south-east of Lithuania [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-26-01065" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] showed that α-TA was found only in 39% of 
 <italic>T. pulegioides</italic> habitats and only 5% of investigated 
 <italic>T. pulegioides</italic> individuals growing in Vilnius region belonged to α-TA chemotype [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-01065" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The climatic gradient is characteristic for climate of Lithuania. In west of Lithuania the climate is oceanic while in the east is continental, which leads to the amplitude of annual temperature increasement and the annual precipitation decrease [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-01065" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Significant annual variation in temperature (hot summers and cold winters) and moderate precipitation amount (concentrated mostly in the warmer months) which are characteristic to continental climate could be related to greater amount of 
 <italic>T. pulegioides</italic> α-TA chemotype in western Lithuania. Frequent location of 
 <italic>T. pulegioides</italic> α-TA chemotype slopes in southern, southwestern, south-eastern, and eastern Lithuania (such slopes form warmer microclimate with higher lightness and solar radiation) showed connection between percentage of α-TA and exposures size of these slopes. Moreover, individuals of α-TA chemotype often occur on the slopes. Literature data also demonstrate similar tendencies of α-TA chemotype occurrence. As dominated compound α-TA was found in essential oils of six 
 <italic>T. pulegioides</italic> samples growing wild in subalpine location at Puy-de-I’Angle (Massif Central, France) only at altitude of 1700 m indicating 64.8–81.4% of essential oils in these samples [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-01065" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Therefore, a search of 
 <italic>T. pulegioides</italic> α-TA chemotype plants, as resource of natural α-TA, would be suitable in regions with continental climate and in slopes with southern exposure since this chemotype is expecting to accumulate more α-TA in essential oil in these conditions.
