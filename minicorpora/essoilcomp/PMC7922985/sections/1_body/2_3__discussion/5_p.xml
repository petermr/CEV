<p>Auto-phytotoxic effect of α-TA essential oil was low and not significant. Phytotoxic effect α-TA on 
 <italic>T. pulegioides</italic> was quite weak and demonstrated that individuals of 
 <italic>T. pulegioides</italic> α-TA chemotype have low intra-species competition between other chemotypes. This could be one of the reasons why this acetate is rare in 
 <italic>T. pulegioides</italic> which is growing wild in Lithuania and other Europe countries.
