<p>Different chemotypes of genus 
 <italic>Thymus</italic> can have various phytotoxic effects on associated (neighboring) species due to their chemical polymorphism. Previous studies suggested that phenolic terpenes (carvacrol and thymol) of thyme reduce seed germination to a greater extent than nonphenolic terpenes [

 <italic>Thymus</italic>. They can amount 60–80% of essential oil and have phytotoxic and/or auto-phytotoxic effect. Some literature data suggest that thyme monoterpenes can reduce seeds germination or plant growth and thus influence plant community’s composition and dynamic [

 <xref rid="B60-molecules-26-01065" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-26-01065" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Oxygenated monoterpene α-TA was the main compound of monoterpenes fraction in essential oil of 
 <italic>T. pulegioides</italic> α-TA chemotype. In our laboratory phytotoxic and antimicrobial experiments, the obtained amount of oxygenated monoterpene α-TA was 64.22% of essential oil (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-01065-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). High economic productivity forage grasses and legumes (such as dicotyledon 
 <italic>T. pratense</italic>, monocotyledons 
 <italic>P. pratensis</italic> and 
 <italic>P. pretense</italic>) and pharmacologically valuable plants (for example, dicotyledon 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic>) are common in plant communities with 
 <italic>T. pulegioides</italic> [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-26-01065" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Therefore, neighborhood of 
 <italic>T. pulegioides</italic> α-TA chemotype can effect germination and seedlings of these species. According to results α-TA (in essential oil and pure) differently (negative or in some cases positive) influenced investigated plants. Also, its phytotoxic effect was stronger on investigated monocotyledons than on dicotyledons. Especially strong negative affect of α-TA essential oil was observed on seeds germination and radicles growth of 
 <italic>P. pratensis</italic>. However, the inhibition effect of α-TA (in essential oil and pure) on seeds germination and radicles growth of other monocotyledon 
 <italic>P. pratense</italic> was weaker and it was detected stronger through air. Meanwhile, α-TA essential oil slightly stimulated seeds germination of dicotyledon 
 <italic>T. pratense</italic> (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-01065-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Results from previous studies suggested that monoterpenes from thyme species can show not only inhibition effect, but also can positive affect seeds germination and seedlings growth. For example, geraniol chemotype of 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> stimulated germination of 
 <italic>Daucus carota</italic> and 
 <italic>Bromus madritensis</italic> [
