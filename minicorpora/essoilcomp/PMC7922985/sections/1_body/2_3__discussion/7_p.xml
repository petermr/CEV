<p>To analyze the antimicrobial effect of essential oil of 
 <italic>T. pulegioides</italic> α-TA chemotype and pure α-TA the broth microdilution method was employed and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against the selected microorganisms were determined. The growth inhibition of investigated bacteria by α-TA essential oil was weak compare to other microorganisms and antibiotics vancomycin and gentamicin which were used as controls. The analysis showed that pure α-TA demonstrated effect on Gram-positive bacterium 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> but was not effective on Gram-negative bacterium 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. Recently, it was shown that essential oil of 
 <italic>Elettaria cardamomum</italic>, in which major components are α-terpinyl acetate (47.5%), demonstrated effectiveness against Gram-positive bacteria ranked 0.125 to 1 mg/mL [

 <italic>Thymus algeriensis</italic> essential oil (α-terpinyl acetate 47.4%) showed antimicrobial activity against the Gram-positive bacteria [
