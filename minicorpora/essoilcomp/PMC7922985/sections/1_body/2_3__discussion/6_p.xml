<p>In general, our results demonstrated that α-TA did not show high phytotoxity on investigated plant species. Only monocotyledon 
 <italic>P. pratensis</italic> was phytotoxicaly hypersensitive to α-TA. Therefore, neighborhoods of 
 <italic>T. pulegioides</italic> α-TA chemotype could negatively affect this forage grass and its habitats. Experiment with 47 different monoterpenoids chemical groups and estimation of their effect on seed germination and subsequent growth of 
 <italic>Lactuca sativa</italic> seedlings showed that from the oxygenated compounds the least inhibitory were the acetates. Free hydroxyl group of alcohol can turn to carboxyl group making the resulting ester activity lower to germination and seedling growth [
