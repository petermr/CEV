Essential oils are widely used as supportive ingredients in many diseases, especially in the acute and chronic diseases of the respiratory tract. Neuroinflammation is responsible for several diseases of the central nervous system. Some plant-derived bioactive molecules have been shown to have role in attenuating neuroinflammation by regulating microglia, the immune cells of the CNS.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">In this study, the anti-inflammatory effect of three chemotypes of thyme essential oil and their main compounds (geraniol, thujanol and linalool) were examined on lipopolysaccharide-induced BV-2 microglia. Three different experimental setups were used, LPS pretreatment, essential oil pretreatment and co-treatments of LPS and essential oils in order to determine whether essential oils are able to prevent inflammation and can decrease it. The concentrations of the secreted tumour necrosis factor &#x003b1; (TNF&#x003b1;) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) proinflammatory cytokines were measured and we analysed by Western blot the activity of the cell signalling pathways, NF-&#x003ba;B and CCAAT-enhancer binding protein &#x003b2; (C/EBP&#x003b2;) regulating TNF&#x003b1; and IL-6 proinflammatory cytokine expressions in BV-2 cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Our results showed definite alterations in the effects of essential oil chemotypes and their main compounds at the different experimental setups. Considering the changes of IL-6 and TNF&#x003b1; secretions the best reduction of inflammatory cytokines could be reached by the pretreatment with the essential oils. In addition, the main compounds exerted better effects than essential oil chemotypes in case of LPS pretreatment. At the essential oil pretreatment experiment, the effect of linalool and geraniol was outstanding but there was no major difference between the actions of chemotypes and standards. Main compounds could be seen to have large inhibitory effects on certain cell signalling components related to the activation of the expression of proinflammatory cytokines.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">Thyme essential oils are good candidates to use in prevention of neuroinflammation and related neurodegeneration, but the exact ratio of the components has to be selected carefully.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12906-021-03319-w.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Essential oil</kwd><kwd>Inflammation</kwd><kwd>Microglia</kwd><kwd>Cytokine</kwd><kwd>NF-&#x003ba;B</kwd><kwd>C/EBP&#x003b2;</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2021</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par17">Today there is an increasing demand for the use of natural ingredients and their derivatives in the treatment of different health problems. Among them essential oils enjoy popularity, which are commonly used nowadays in cosmetics, health care, traditional medicine and food industry. Because of their antimicrobial activities, the application of the essential oils is widespread. They have a complex mode of action due to their multiple composition. The composition of essential oils is variable and the physiological action and organoleptic characteristic is dominated by the major constituent defined by chemotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">The volatile essential oils can easily reach the upper and lower parts of the respiratory tract via inhalation. They possess both antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects, therefore they can provide an effective treatment against infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. After infection several molecular and cellular events play role in stimulating initial acute inflammation, which leads to the accumulation of leukocytes and plasma proteins induced by cytokines derived from protector cells like dendritic, mast, endothelial cells and macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Microglia, the immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) are activated at inflammation process and produce inflammatory cytokines, which may impair the function of nerve cells causing cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Therefore, the role of the anti-inflammatory extracts and their components obtained from plants are highly important. Furthermore, neuroinflammation is responsible for several CNS diseases (e.g. neurodegenerative disorders, depression, sleep disorders, and stroke) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. To prevent neuroinflammation there is possibility to cure these disorders.

Recent evidence has proven that the essential oils can transfer through the nasal mucosa during inhalation, can enter the blood circulation and pass through the blood-brain barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Because of the great number of constituents, essential oils seem to have several potential cellular targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. P&#x000e9;rez et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] summarized the anti-inflammatory properties of some essential oils and their proposed or studied mechanism of action. These mode of actions include various processes, e.g. modulation of lipoxygenase enzymatic activity, nitric oxide (NO) inhibition, inhibition of secretion of proinflammatory cytokines like tumour necrosis factor &#x003b1; (TNF&#x003b1;) and interleukin-1&#x003b2; (IL-1&#x003b2;), and inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B activation.</p><p id="Par21">Essential oil of thyme (<italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> L.) is utilized as complementary therapy of acute and chronic diseases of the respiratory tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].

Treatments with essential oils might be harmful to the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], therefore their effects on cell viability in different dilutions (200-fold, 500-fold and 1000-fold) at 6&#x02009;h and 24&#x02009;h long treatments were examined DMSO was used as a carrier in the stock solutions, therefore, the effect of DMSO on the cells was also determined. DMSO did not affect significantly the cell viability (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a,b). The three different chemotypes of the thyme essential oil acted similarly on the BV-2 cells, they did not caused significant changes on viability. The only exception was linalool that decreased significantly the viability at 6&#x02009;h in each dilutions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). On the contrary, essential oil standards caused remarkable alterations in cell viability. Both linalool and geraniol increased the viability of BV-2 cells at 6&#x02009;h and 24&#x02009;h, in the latter time point the elevation was significant (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Meanwhile, thujanol standard decreased the viability at 6&#x02009;h, but increased it at 24&#x02009;h (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Based on the results it seems that neither the standards nor the chemotypes were not toxic for the cells at 24&#x02009;h.

Linalool standard decreased the examined protein levels (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b,e). Thujanol chemotype and geraniol standard decreased p50 levels. Interestingly, geraniol chemotype altered only p50 level (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b,e). Linalool chemotype acted the same was as in case of LPS pretreatment, it did not affect NF-&#x003ba;B protein expressions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b,e).</p><p id="Par40">LPS and essential oil co-treatments revealed completely different results compared to the former experiments. Geraniol standard was the most effective against NF-&#x003ba;B proteins; it decreased the levels of all of the examined proteins. However, geraniol chemotype did not change the levels of any of these proteins (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c,f). Geraniol standard decreased both NF-&#x003ba;B protein levels, but geraniol chemotype did not. Thujanol chemotype and standard only decreased p50 protein level. Linalool chemotype successfully decreased p50 protein level, while linalool standard did not exert any changes on NF-&#x003ba;B proteins (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c,f).</p><p id="Par41">Based on these Western blot results it seems that geraniol standard has the most powerful effect on the LPS-stimulated inflammatory response. Geraniol chemotype and linalool and thujanol standards were also successful in decreasing the effect of LPS treatment on NF-&#x003ba;B pathway. Thujanol chemotype and standard and linalool standard could prevent NF&#x003ba;B activation at LPS treatment.</p><p id="Par42">The alterations of the NF-&#x003ba;B signalling pathway could not explain completely the changes in the TNF&#x003b1; expression; therefore, the level of the P-C/EBP&#x003b2; transcription factor, which has been described as a possible TNF&#x003b1; regulator in myelomonocytic cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] was also examined. All of the essential oil standards and among the chemotypes geraniol and thujanol could attenuate the effect of LPS pretreatment on P-C/EBP&#x003b2; transcription factor (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a,d). In case of essential oil pretreatment the aforementioned chemotypes and standards successfully decreased P-C/EBP&#x003b2; protein level with the only exception thujanol standard (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b,e). Interestingly, the co-treatment of BV-2 cells with LPS and essential oils did not affect the level of P-C/EBP&#x003b2; transcription factor, only geraniol chemotype decreased significantly the P-C/EBP&#x003b2; protein level (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c,f). Geraniol chemotype was the only essential oil, which was able to decrease P-C/EBP&#x003b2; level in each experiment. Moreover, this chemotype was also successful in preventing the effect of LPS treatment on NF&#x003ba;B pathway. Thujanol chemotype and linalool, geraniol standards were also capable to prevent the LPS-induced C/EBP&#x003b2; activation. The only essential oil that was ineffective in C/EBP&#x003b2; activation in all three types of experiments was linalool chemotype. Moreover, linalool chemotype produced no effect on the NF&#x003ba;B activation, too.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par43">Large number of medicinal herbs and their extracts are used for treatments of various diseases. One of the most frequently examined plant is thyme (<italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> L.). Different chemotypes of the essential oils of this plant have been tested in the past and proved their antibacterial and antifungal activities, though at various effectiveness against the certain microbes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">It is clear that there are fundamental differences among essential oils and their chemotypes not only in their therapeutic but also in their basic effects on cultured cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], which was proved by the viability assays carried out in time and concentration dependence. In addition plant extracts behave distinctly depending on the target cell: in a numerous experiments they were used not on cultured cells but against microbes directly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p id="Par45">Nowadays it has been accepted that inflammation is playing a determining role in the development and seriousness of neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease, Parkinson&#x02019;s disease or multiple sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In the central nervous system astrocytes and microglia are responsible for mediating the immunoresponse against inflammatory agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The essential oils are lipophilic and organic molecules, which are able to transfer across the epithelium in nasal mucosa. Upon passing through the epithelium they move into systemic circulation and cross the blood-brain barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], although the components of the essential oils show different permeability via the blood-brain barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Cheng et al. described that linalool can pass through the blood-brain barrier in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and can reverse both neuropathological and behavioural impairments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Geraniol was successful in decreasing the impairments of motor behaviour in mouse model of Parkinson&#x02019;s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Based on the neuroprotective and anti-aging effects of essential oils they can be used as complementary therapy in age related neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease, Huntington&#x02019;s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">We have been investigating the potential protective effect of <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> essential oil chemotypes and their main compounds in an in vitro microglial cell culture system. As a model LPS was used to imitate bacterial infection in cell cultures and tested the effects of chemotypes of thyme essential oil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Relatively little is known about the interactions of these essential oils and the cells of the nervous system<italic>.</italic> By Elmann et al. the effects of geranium oil was examined in primary rat microglia cell culture as the protective agent against inflammation mediated by LPS administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Essential oil was added at the same time with LPS to the cultured cells. According to the authors, NO release and the expression of inducible NO synthase and cyclooxygenase 2 were reduced by the geranium oil treatment. These experiments are modelling neurodegenerative diseases which are related to neuroinflammation.</p><p id="Par47">The post ischemic processes in the brain involve a large number of components. Among them the leaders are the proinflammatory cytokines, which are playing a basic role in the worsening of the damage of the blood brain barrier as well as the activation of microglial cells. The protective effect of linalool was examined in rats after a period of cerebral arterial occlusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Also primary glial cells suffered less damage after glutamate challenge when treated with linalool. It is interesting that linalool was administered intranasal proving that these plant compounds can reach the cells of the central nervous system via the blood brain barrier by inhalation.</p><p id="Par48">BV-2 rodent microglia are widely accepted models for examining those agents, which may be involved in induction of neurodegeneration by microglia activation. LPS is a component of the cell wall of Gram- negative bacteria and may be used in microglia cell culture to mimic inflammation and for testing potential anti-inflammatory molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The advantages of model cell culture experiments are the possibility of large number of variations in controlled circumstances. The temperature, composition of the cell culture medium are the same, while the timing and the concentrations of the different treatments are variable. Also it is possible to carry out the treatments in different order or at the same time. With these setups it was possible to imitate the preventive effect or the therapeutic effects of the different pharmaceutical molecules. In addition, there is a possibility to compare essential oils, chemotypes from the market, or produced in-house.</p><p id="Par49">In our work definite alterations were revealed in the effects of essential oil chemotypes and their main compounds at the different experimental setups. These cellular changes were followed at mRNA and at protein levels in LPS treated cells and in cells without LPS challenge. In general the reduction in proinflammatory IL-6 and TNF&#x003b1; syntheses and secretions were seen at the presence of treatments.</p><p id="Par50">A couple of comparisons were carried out in our experiments: the effects of three different chemotypes and standards on the survival of BV-2 cells as well as on the synthesis and secretion of IL-6 and TNF&#x003b1;. The latter changes were followed together with LPS treatment, in three versions: pretreatment with LPS, pretreatment with essential oils, or co-treatment with the two types of substances. We examined the NF-&#x003ba;B signalling pathway and the TNF&#x003b1; regulation activity in each of the three treatment versions mentioned above.</p><p id="Par51">Essential oils by themselves had effect on IL-6 and TNF&#x003b1; mRNA syntheses and secretions. It was revealed several times that the mRNA synthesis and cytokine release are not always changing parallel. The protein synthesis and posttranslational modifications may have different regulatory signals than transcription or it is a possibility that the former processes need more time than the mRNA synthesis. The two proinflammatory cytokines show the same secretion pattern, with chemotypes e.g. linalool and geraniol exerting stronger effects. This phenomenon can be observed frequently, suggesting that a pure, single component can have limitations, a &#x0201c;mixture&#x0201d; in a plant extract is having more active compounds that may cooperate against inflammation. Elman et al. found that a single component of essential oil did not exert protective effect in neuroinflammation examined in primary microglia cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p><p id="Par52">Considering the changes of IL-6 and TNF&#x003b1; secretions depending on the relation of LPS and essential oil treatments in time, the best reduction of inflammatory cytokines could be reached by the pretreatment with the essential oils. In these experiments, there were a few surprises. In every setup (LPS pretreatment, essential oil pretreatment, co-treatment of LPS and chemotypes), the reduction of TNF&#x003b1; were grater, than that of the IL-6 at both mRNA and protein levels. In addition, occasionally standards had better effects, than chemotypes, but mainly at mRNA expression. At the essential oil pretreatment experiment the effect of linalool and geraniol was outstanding, proving at least two facts. Using these plant materials as prophylaxis against inflammation (or at least LPS effect) showed the best result. Also according to the research of other scientific groups these two substances in both standard and chemotype forms have specific effects on microglia/macrophages in neuronal injury, hypoxia and degeneration.</p><p id="Par53">To explain the reason of alterations in proinflammatory cytokine production of BV-2 microglia, the transcription factor components of NF-&#x003ba;B, namely the level of chromatin-bound, active p50 and p65 were examined. When they act in heterodimer form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], they activate the transcription of IL-6 and TNF&#x003b1;. Interestingly, standards caused large reduction of chromatin-bound proteins, especially linalool, both in the case of LPS pretreatment as well as in essential oil administration before LPS. Further investigating activations of cell signalling pathways, the level of chromatin-bound, phosphorylated C/EBP&#x003b2; was determined Large differences could be seen in the levels of P-C/EBP&#x003b2; in the effects of standards and chemotypes and co-treatments and pretreatments. Best effects could be observed in geraniol and thujanol chemotypes and linalool and geraniol standards, the latter ones in pretreatment only.</p><p id="Par54">The presence of the additional components in the essential oil chemotypes revealed by GC-MS method may contribute to the effect of the main compounds (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). It was proven that p-cymene, found in both thujanol and linalool chemotypes in 2.1 and 4.2%, possessed anti-inflammatory effects in mice and decreased leukocyte migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. &#x003b3;-Terpinene found in the thujanol chemotype (2.9%) as well as &#x003b1;-terpineol (4.3%) were previously described as anti-inflammatory molecules, the latter one was able to decrease IL-6 mRNA level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. The terpinen-4-ol can suppress the production of inflammatory mediators in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] and may interact with the main components of thujanol (11.9%) and linalool (8.3%) thyme essential oil chemotypes. Linalyl acetate found in thujanol chemotype (2.9%) has been proven to provide anti-inflammatory effect on natural killer cell in a dose dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Nerol was also found in both geraniol (1.9%) and thujanol (4.2%) chemotypes, which was proven to decrease IL-13 and TNF&#x003b1; pro-inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. The anti-inflammatory effect of geraniol chemotype may be supported by the presence of geranyl acetate (18.6%), &#x003b2;-caryophyllene (5.7%), geranyl propionate (2.2%) and elemol (2.2%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. The differences in the composition of the examined thyme essential oil chemotypes may contribute to their distinct effects on the regulation of IL-6 and TNF&#x003b1; pro-inflammatory cytokine syntheses in BV-2 microglia.</p><p id="Par55">Based on our observations it can be concluded that geraniol (both chemotype and standard) has an outstanding effect on decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Moreover, the presence of additional components in the chemotypes may alter the effect of the main compounds since the chemotypes have better effect alone at the treatments, but in the presence of LPS (LPS pretreatment and LPS and essential oils together) they can achieve weaker inhibitory effect on the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.</p><p id="Par56">In summary, we may declare that BV-2 cells are good models to examine the neuroprotective effects of essential oil of thyme (<italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> L.). These protective effects are caused by not the same components, which are responsible for the antibacterial effect of thyme. In many aspects essential oil chemotypes are more effective than standards, but standards could be seen to have large inhibitory effects on certain cell signalling components related to the activation of proinflammatory cytokines. This proves that the final change in the secreted levels of IL-6 and TNF&#x003b1; could not be explained merely by one transcription factor activity. There is also a possibility that the change in the activation of transcription factors is occurring in a different time frame than the examined period in our experiments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par57"><italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> essential oil and its linalool and geraniol chemotypes are good candidates to use in prevention of neuroinflammation and related neurodegeneration, but the exact ratio of the components has to be selected carefully.
