<p id="Par25">Three chemotypes of 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> essential oil, linalool (Lot number: OF16244), geraniol (Lot number: OF7289) and thujanol (Lot number: OF19102) were purchased from Panarom (Panarom Naturkozmetika Kft., Budapest, Hungary). Linalool, geraniol and thujanol essential oil standards were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Sigma-Aldrich Kft., Budapest, Hungary). Stock solutions of the chemotypes were produced by adding 100 μL of pure dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich Kft., Budapest, Hungary) to 900 μL of essential oil, therefore the stock solution contained 90% of essential oil and 10% of DMSO. The emulsions were mixed by vortexing then were diluted with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Lonza Ltd., Basel, Switzerland) 200-fold, 500-fold and 1000-fold. Stock solutions of linalool and geraniol standards were prepared the same way as the chemotypes. Stock solutions of thujanol standard was prepared by solving 4 mg of thujanol in 1 mL of DMSO. Dilutions of the standard stock solutions were carried out the same way as in case of the essential oil chemotypes. For control experiments 10% DMSO stock solution was prepared in PBS and was diluted the same way as the essential oils, 200-fold, 500-fold and 1000-fold. The final concentrations of DMSO used in the experiments were 0.05, 0.02 and 0.01% according to the dilutions.
