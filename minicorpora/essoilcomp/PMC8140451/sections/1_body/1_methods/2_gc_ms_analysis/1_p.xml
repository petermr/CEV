<p id="Par26">The chemical composition of the thyme oil chemotypes was analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A 1 μL of each essential oil sample was diluted in ethanol (10 μL/mL) then it was injected in split mode. The temperature of the injector was 250 °C, the split ratio was 1:10. The analyses were carried out with an Agilent 6890 N/5973 N GC-MSD (Santa Clara, CA, USA) system equipped with a Supelco (Sigma-Aldrich Kft., Budapest, Hungary) SLB-5MS capillary column (30 m × 250 μm × 0.25 μm). The GC oven temperature increased from 60 °C (3 min isothermal) to 250 °C at 8 °C /min (1 min isothermal). The carrier gas was high purity helium (6.0; at 1.0 mL/min (37 cm/s)) in a constant flow mode. The mass selective detector (quadrupole mass analyser) was operated in electron ionization mode at 70 eV in a full scan mode (41–500 amu at 3.2 scan/s). The data were analysed using MSD ChemStation D.02.00.275 software (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The identification of the compounds was carried out by comparing retention times and recorded spectra with the data of authentic standards involving the NIST 2.0 library. The calculation of the percentage was carried out by area normalization [
