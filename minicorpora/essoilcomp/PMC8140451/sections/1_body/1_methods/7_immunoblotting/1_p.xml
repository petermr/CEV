<p id="Par31">BV-2 cells were seeded onto 6-well culture dishes (3 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) and were treated after a 24 h incubation period. BV-2 cells were fractionated immediately after collection using Subcellular Protein Fractionation Kit for Cultured Cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Protein contents of each protein fraction were measured with DC Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad Inc., Hercules, CA). The same amount of protein (15 μg) from each sample was loaded onto 10% or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After the electrophoresis the protein content of the gels were transferred by electro- blotting to nitrocellulose membranes (Pall AG, Basel, Switzerland). The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in TBST (Tris buffer saline, 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature [

After the blocking step, the membranes were probed with the following polyclonal rabbit antibodies for overnight at 4 °C according to the manufacturer’s protocols: anti-NF-κB/p50 IgG (1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich Kft., Budapest, Hungary), anti-NF-κB/p65 IgG (1:2000, Cell Signaling Technology Europe, Leiden, The Netherlands) and anti-phospho-C/EBPβ IgG (1:1000, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA). β-actin (1:2000; Sigma-Aldrich Kft., Budapest, Hungary) was used as housekeeping control in all Western blot experiments. Goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugate was used as secondary antibody (1:3000; Bio-Rad Inc., Hercules, CA). Protein detection was carried out with WesternBright ECL chemiluminescent substrate (Advansta Inc., San Jose, CA). Optical densities of Western blots were determined using ImageJ software [
