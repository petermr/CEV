<p id="Par28">BV-2 cells were plated onto 96-well plates using 5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/well. Cells were treated with essential oils and standards in 200-fold, 500-fold and 1000-fold dilutions for 6 h and 24 h. Viability of the BV-2 cells were measured using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) cell viability assay (Sigma-Aldrich Kft., Budapest, Hungary) after the treatments. DMSO treated cells were used as controls of the essential oil treated cells, while the effect of DMSO on cell viability was determined by using untreated cells as controls. After each treatment 10 μL of WST-8 reagent was added to each well, then the plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. After incubation, 10 μL of 1% sodium-dodecyl sulphate (SDS, Molar Chemicals Kft., Halásztelek, Hungary) was added to each well to stop the reaction. The absorbance of the samples was measured at 450 nm using MultiSkan GO microplate spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA). Viability was expressed as percentile of the total cell number of the appropriate control.
