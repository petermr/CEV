<p id="Par27">BV-2 murine microglial cells (kind gift from Prof. László Tretter and his research group) were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Lonza Ltd., Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, EuroClone S.p.A, Pero, Italy) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Lonza Ltd., Basel, Switzerland). The cells were cultured on poly-L-ornithine (Sigma-Aldrich Kft., Budapest, Hungary) coated dishes (Sarstedt Kft., Budapest, Hungary). BV-2 cells were seeded into 6-well plates and were cultured for 24 h before the treatments. The cells were treated with 200-fold diluted essential oil chemotypes and standards to determine their effects on cytokine production. Inflammatory condition was generated by LPS treatment (1 μg/mL, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O55:B5, Sigma-Aldrich Kft., Budapest, Hungary). Anti-inflammatory effects of essential oils were determined in three different experiments: LPS pretreatment for 24 h then essential oil treatment for 24 h; essential oil pretreatment for 24 h then LPS treatment for 24 h; and co-treatment with LPS and essential oils for 24 h. DMSO treated cells were used as controls. The final concentrations of DMSO used in the experiments were 0.05, 0.02 and 0.01% according to the dilutions. Each experiments were repeated at least three times. All experiments were carried out in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37 °C.
