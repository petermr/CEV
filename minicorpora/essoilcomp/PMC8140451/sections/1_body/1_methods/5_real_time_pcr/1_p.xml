<p id="Par29">BV-2 cells were treated the same way as described earlier, in 6-well culture dishes (3 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well). After the treatments, BV-2 cells were washed with PBS and then were collected after trypsinization. Total RNA was isolated from each sample using Quick RNA mini kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). Complementary DNA was synthesised from 200 ng of total RNA using High capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Determination of gene expressions was performed in a CFX96 Real-time System (Bio-Rad Inc., Hercules, CA) using iTaq™ Universal SYBR® Green Supermix (Bio-Rad Inc., Hercules, CA) in a 20 μL of total reaction volume. Melting curves were generated after each quantitative PCR run to ensure that a single specific product was amplified. Relative quantification was calculated by the Livak (∆∆Ct) method using the Bio-Rad CFX Maestro software (Bio-Rad Inc., Hercules, CA). The expression level of the gene of interest was compared with the level of β-actin in each sample. These relative expression rates were then compared between the treated and the untreated samples. The relative expression of the controls was regarded as 1 [
