<p id="Par24">Our results unravelled that thyme oil chemotypes and their main compounds possess anti-inflammatory effect on LPS-induced microglia via modulating the activation of NF-κB and C/EBPβ signalling pathways and decreasing the secretion of IL-6 and TNFα proinflammatory cytokines. It was demonstrated that chemotypes and the main compounds exerted different inhibitory effects on the examined signalling proteins. Based on our results we suppose that development of an essential oil product containing the major compounds of thyme essential oil in a proper ratio would be successful as complementary neurotherapeutics against neuroinflammation.</p>
