<p id="Par19">Microglia, the immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) are activated at inflammation process and produce inflammatory cytokines, which may impair the function of nerve cells causing cell death [

Furthermore, neuroinflammation is responsible for several CNS diseases (e.g. neurodegenerative disorders, depression, sleep disorders, and stroke) [
