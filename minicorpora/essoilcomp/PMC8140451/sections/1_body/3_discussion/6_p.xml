<p id="Par48">BV-2 rodent microglia are widely accepted models for examining those agents, which may be involved in induction of neurodegeneration by microglia activation. LPS is a component of the cell wall of Gram- negative bacteria and may be used in microglia cell culture to mimic inflammation and for testing potential anti-inflammatory molecules [

The temperature, composition of the cell culture medium are the same, while the timing and the concentrations of the different treatments are variable. Also it is possible to carry out the treatments in different order or at the same time. With these setups it was possible to imitate the preventive effect or the therapeutic effects of the different pharmaceutical molecules. In addition, there is a possibility to compare essential oils, chemotypes from the market, or produced in-house.
