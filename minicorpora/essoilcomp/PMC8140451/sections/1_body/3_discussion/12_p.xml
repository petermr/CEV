<p id="Par54">The presence of the additional components in the essential oil chemotypes revealed by GC-MS method may contribute to the effect of the main compounds (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). It was proven that p-cymene, found in both thujanol and linalool chemotypes in 2.1 and 4.2%, possessed anti-inflammatory effects in mice and decreased leukocyte migration [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. γ-Terpinene found in the thujanol chemotype (2.9%) as well as α-terpineol (4.3%) were previously described as anti-inflammatory molecules, the latter one was able to decrease IL-6 mRNA level [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. The terpinen-4-ol can suppress the production of inflammatory mediators in macrophages [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] and may interact with the main components of thujanol (11.9%) and linalool (8.3%) thyme essential oil chemotypes. Linalyl acetate found in thujanol chemotype (2.9%) has been proven to provide anti-inflammatory effect on natural killer cell in a dose dependent manner [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Nerol was also found in both geraniol (1.9%) and thujanol (4.2%) chemotypes, which was proven to decrease IL-13 and TNFα pro-inflammatory cytokines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. The anti-inflammatory effect of geraniol chemotype may be supported by the presence of geranyl acetate (18.6%), β-caryophyllene (5.7%), geranyl propionate (2.2%) and elemol (2.2%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. The differences in the composition of the examined thyme essential oil chemotypes may contribute to their distinct effects on the regulation of IL-6 and TNFα pro-inflammatory cytokine syntheses in BV-2 microglia.
