<p id="Par51">Essential oils by themselves had effect on IL-6 and TNFα mRNA syntheses and secretions. It was revealed several times that the mRNA synthesis and cytokine release are not always changing parallel. The protein synthesis and posttranslational modifications may have different regulatory signals than transcription or it is a possibility that the former processes need more time than the mRNA synthesis. The two proinflammatory cytokines show the same secretion pattern, with chemotypes e.g. linalool and geraniol exerting stronger effects. This phenomenon can be observed frequently, suggesting that a pure, single component can have limitations, a “mixture” in a plant extract is having more active compounds that may cooperate against inflammation. Elman et al. found that a single component of essential oil did not exert protective effect in neuroinflammation examined in primary microglia cells [
