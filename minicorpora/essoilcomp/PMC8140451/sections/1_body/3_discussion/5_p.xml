<p id="Par47">The post ischemic processes in the brain involve a large number of components. Among them the leaders are the proinflammatory cytokines, which are playing a basic role in the worsening of the damage of the blood brain barrier as well as the activation of microglial cells. The protective effect of linalool was examined in rats after a period of cerebral arterial occlusion [

It is interesting that linalool was administered intranasal proving that these plant compounds can reach the cells of the central nervous system via the blood brain barrier by inhalation.
