<p id="Par53">To explain the reason of alterations in proinflammatory cytokine production of BV-2 microglia, the transcription factor components of NF-κB, namely the level of chromatin-bound, active p50 and p65 were examined. When they act in heterodimer form [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], they activate the transcription of IL-6 and TNFα. Interestingly, standards caused large reduction of chromatin-bound proteins, especially linalool, both in the case of LPS pretreatment as well as in essential oil administration before LPS. Further investigating activations of cell signalling pathways, the level of chromatin-bound, phosphorylated C/EBPβ was determined Large differences could be seen in the levels of P-C/EBPβ in the effects of standards and chemotypes and co-treatments and pretreatments. Best effects could be observed in geraniol and thujanol chemotypes and linalool and geraniol standards, the latter ones in pretreatment only.
