<p id="Par55">Based on our observations it can be concluded that geraniol (both chemotype and standard) has an outstanding effect on decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Moreover, the presence of additional components in the chemotypes may alter the effect of the main compounds since the chemotypes have better effect alone at the treatments, but in the presence of LPS (LPS pretreatment and LPS and essential oils together) they can achieve weaker inhibitory effect on the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.</p>
