<p id="Par50">A couple of comparisons were carried out in our experiments: the effects of three different chemotypes and standards on the survival of BV-2 cells as well as on the synthesis and secretion of IL-6 and TNFα. The latter changes were followed together with LPS treatment, in three versions: pretreatment with LPS, pretreatment with essential oils, or co-treatment with the two types of substances. We examined the NF-κB signalling pathway and the TNFα regulation activity in each of the three treatment versions mentioned above.</p>
