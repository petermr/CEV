<p id="Par45">Nowadays it has been accepted that inflammation is playing a determining role in the development and seriousness of neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease or multiple sclerosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In the central nervous system astrocytes and microglia are responsible for mediating the immunoresponse against inflammatory agents [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The essential oils are lipophilic and organic molecules, which are able to transfer across the epithelium in nasal mucosa. Upon passing through the epithelium they move into systemic circulation and cross the blood-brain barrier [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], although the components of the essential oils show different permeability via the blood-brain barrier [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Cheng et al. described that linalool can pass through the blood-brain barrier in mice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and can reverse both neuropathological and behavioural impairments [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Geraniol was successful in decreasing the impairments of motor behaviour in mouse model of Parkinson’s disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Based on the neuroprotective and anti-aging effects of essential oils they can be used as complementary therapy in age related neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [
