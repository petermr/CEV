<p id="Par56">In summary, we may declare that BV-2 cells are good models to examine the neuroprotective effects of essential oil of thyme (
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> L.). These protective effects are caused by not the same components, which are responsible for the antibacterial effect of thyme. In many aspects essential oil chemotypes are more effective than standards, but standards could be seen to have large inhibitory effects on certain cell signalling components related to the activation of proinflammatory cytokines. This proves that the final change in the secreted levels of IL-6 and TNFÎ± could not be explained merely by one transcription factor activity. There is also a possibility that the change in the activation of transcription factors is occurring in a different time frame than the examined period in our experiments.
