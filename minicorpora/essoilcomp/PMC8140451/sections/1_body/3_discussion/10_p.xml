<p id="Par52">Considering the changes of IL-6 and TNFα secretions depending on the relation of LPS and essential oil treatments in time, the best reduction of inflammatory cytokines could be reached by the pretreatment with the essential oils. In these experiments, there were a few surprises. In every setup (LPS pretreatment, essential oil pretreatment, co-treatment of LPS and chemotypes), the reduction of TNFα were grater, than that of the IL-6 at both mRNA and protein levels. In addition, occasionally standards had better effects, than chemotypes, but mainly at mRNA expression. At the essential oil pretreatment experiment the effect of linalool and geraniol was outstanding, proving at least two facts. Using these plant materials as prophylaxis against inflammation (or at least LPS effect) showed the best result. Also according to the research of other scientific groups these two substances in both standard and chemotype forms have specific effects on microglia/macrophages in neuronal injury, hypoxia and degeneration.</p>
