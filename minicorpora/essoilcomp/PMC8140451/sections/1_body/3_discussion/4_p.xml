<p id="Par46">We have been investigating the potential protective effect of 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> essential oil chemotypes and their main compounds in an in vitro microglial cell culture system. As a model LPS was used to imitate bacterial infection in cell cultures and tested the effects of chemotypes of thyme essential oil [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Relatively little is known about the interactions of these essential oils and the cells of the nervous system
 <italic>.</italic> By Elmann et al. the effects of geranium oil was examined in primary rat microglia cell culture as the protective agent against inflammation mediated by LPS administration [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Essential oil was added at the same time with LPS to the cultured cells. According to the authors, NO release and the expression of inducible NO synthase and cyclooxygenase 2 were reduced by the geranium oil treatment. These experiments are modelling neurodegenerative diseases which are related to neuroinflammation.
