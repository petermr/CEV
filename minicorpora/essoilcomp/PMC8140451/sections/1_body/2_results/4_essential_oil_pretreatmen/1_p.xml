<p id="Par36">Additional experiments were carried out to reveal whether a pretreatment of BV-2 cells with essential oils was capable to attenuate the inflammatory effect of LPS. Linalool, geraniol and thujanol chemotypes were able to decrease both the IL-6 and TNFα mRNA levels (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). Among essential oil standards, only geraniol was capable to downregulate IL-6 mRNA expression and interestingly geraniol was the only one that did not decrease the TNFα mRNA level. Linalool and thujanol standards were effective only against the elevated TNFα mRNA expression (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). At protein level, both chemotypes and standards of linalool and geraniol significantly decreased IL-6 secretion suggesting that might be a delay between mRNA expression and protein synthesis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). The results of TNFα ELISA revealed that all essential oil chemotypes and standards decreased TNFα secretion except thujanol standard suggesting that pure thujanol essential oil acts through different pathways or it has distinct effect on TNFα synthesis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b).
