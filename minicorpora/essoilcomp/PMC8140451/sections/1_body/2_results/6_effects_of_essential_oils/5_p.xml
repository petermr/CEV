<p id="Par42">The alterations of the NF-κB signalling pathway could not explain completely the changes in the TNFα expression; therefore, the level of the P-C/EBPβ transcription factor, which has been described as a possible TNFα regulator in myelomonocytic cell lines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] was also examined. All of the essential oil standards and among the chemotypes geraniol and thujanol could attenuate the effect of LPS pretreatment on P-C/EBPβ transcription factor (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a,d). In case of essential oil pretreatment the aforementioned chemotypes and standards successfully decreased P-C/EBPβ protein level with the only exception thujanol standard (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b,e). Interestingly, the co-treatment of BV-2 cells with LPS and essential oils did not affect the level of P-C/EBPβ transcription factor, only geraniol chemotype decreased significantly the P-C/EBPβ protein level (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c,f). Geraniol chemotype was the only essential oil, which was able to decrease P-C/EBPβ level in each experiment. Moreover, this chemotype was also successful in preventing the effect of LPS treatment on NFκB pathway. Thujanol chemotype and linalool, geraniol standards were also capable to prevent the LPS-induced C/EBPβ activation. The only essential oil that was ineffective in C/EBPβ activation in all three types of experiments was linalool chemotype. Moreover, linalool chemotype produced no effect on the NFκB activation, too.
