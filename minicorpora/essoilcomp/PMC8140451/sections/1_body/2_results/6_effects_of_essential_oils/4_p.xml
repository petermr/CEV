<p id="Par41">Based on these Western blot results it seems that geraniol standard has the most powerful effect on the LPS-stimulated inflammatory response. Geraniol chemotype and linalool and thujanol standards were also successful in decreasing the effect of LPS treatment on NF-κB pathway. Thujanol chemotype and standard and linalool standard could prevent NFκB activation at LPS treatment.</p>
