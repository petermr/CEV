<p id="Par40">LPS and essential oil co-treatments revealed completely different results compared to the former experiments. Geraniol standard was the most effective against NF-κB proteins; it decreased the levels of all of the examined proteins. However, geraniol chemotype did not change the levels of any of these proteins (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c,f). Geraniol standard decreased both NF-κB protein levels, but geraniol chemotype did not. Thujanol chemotype and standard only decreased p50 protein level. Linalool chemotype successfully decreased p50 protein level, while linalool standard did not exert any changes on NF-κB proteins (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c,f).
