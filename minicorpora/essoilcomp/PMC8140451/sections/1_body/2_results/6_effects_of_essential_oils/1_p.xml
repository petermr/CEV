<p id="Par38">LPS activates NF-κB pathway of microglia through toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). After nuclear translocation, the NF-κB transcription factor activates the expression of proinflammatory genes (e.g. IL-6 and TNFα) by binding to their promoter regions [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The effect of essential oil chemotypes and standards on the protein level of NF-κB using specific antibodies against p50 and p65 proteins were examined. In case of the LPS pretreatment following by essential oil treatments, the p50 level decreased by linalool and geraniol standards; meanwhile they did not change significantly the p65 protein level (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a,d). Geraniol chemotype and thujanol standard decreased both p50 and p65 protein levels (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a,d). Linalool chemotype did not affect the protein level of the examined NF-κB proteins.
