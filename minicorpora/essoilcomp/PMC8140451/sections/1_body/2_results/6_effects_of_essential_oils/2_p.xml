<p id="Par39">Essential oil pretreatment partially changed the protein expression levels of NF-κB proteins regulated by LPS. Linalool standard decreased the examined protein levels (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b,e). Thujanol chemotype and geraniol standard decreased p50 levels. Interestingly, geraniol chemotype altered only p50 level (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b,e). Linalool chemotype acted the same was as in case of LPS pretreatment, it did not affect NF-κB protein expressions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b,e).
