<p id="Par34">IL-6 and TNFα are proinflammatory cytokines, and their increased productions indicate the activation of the microglial cells. 24 h long treatments of BV-2 cells were carried out to determine their effects on the mRNA levels and protein secretions of IL-6 and TNFα cytokines. All of the examined essential oil chemotypes and their standards significantly decreased the mRNA expressions of IL-6 and TNFα compared to the DMSO treated control cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). All of the essential oil chemotypes decreased the IL-6 secretion (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). From the standards, only linalool was able to decrease significantly the IL-6 secretion, meanwhile thujanol standard significantly increased IL-6 protein level (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). ELISA measurements showed that the same three chemotypes, linalool, geraniol and thujanol decreased TNFα secretion suggesting that these chemotypes are good candidates for anti-inflammatory treatment against neuroinflammation. Linalool and geraniol standards were also successful in decreasing significantly the TNFα secretion. Thujanol standard treated cells showed also decreased TNFα level, but it could not be consider as a significant change (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b).
