<p id="Par37">BV-2 cells were treated parallel with LPS and essential oils to clarify whether the essential oil chemotypes and/or standards could modify the effect of LPS on the proinflammatory cytokine production of microglia. Essential oil chemotypes and geraniol standard were successful in decreasing the mRNA levels of IL-6 and TNFα cytokines (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). IL-6 mRNA level was also elevated by linalool and thujanol standards; moreover linalool significantly increased TNFα mRNA expression as well (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). All of the chemotypes, and among the standards only geraniol were capable to decrease both IL-6 and TNFα secretions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). Linalool standard decreased only TNFα secretion while thujanol standard was effective against IL-6 production (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). Interestingly, thujanol standard increased TNFα secretion compared to the LPS treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b).
