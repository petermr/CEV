<p id="Par33">According to the GC-MS, geraniol (54.9%), thujanol (33.9%) and linalool (69.2%) were detected as main compounds in the three thyme oil chemotypes. Treatments with essential oils might be harmful to the cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], therefore their effects on cell viability in different dilutions (200-fold, 500-fold and 1000-fold) at 6 h and 24 h long treatments were examined DMSO was used as a carrier in the stock solutions, therefore, the effect of DMSO on the cells was also determined. DMSO did not affect significantly the cell viability (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a,b). The three different chemotypes of the thyme essential oil acted similarly on the BV-2 cells, they did not caused significant changes on viability. The only exception was linalool that decreased significantly the viability at 6 h in each dilutions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). On the contrary, essential oil standards caused remarkable alterations in cell viability. Both linalool and geraniol increased the viability of BV-2 cells at 6 h and 24 h, in the latter time point the elevation was significant (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Meanwhile, thujanol standard decreased the viability at 6 h, but increased it at 24 h (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Based on the results it seems that neither the standards nor the chemotypes were not toxic for the cells at 24 h. Therefore we chose the 200-fold dilution of essential oil chemotypes and standards for further studies. Percentage (%) and relative concentrations (μg/mL) of the main compounds of different chemotype thyme oils can be seen in Table
