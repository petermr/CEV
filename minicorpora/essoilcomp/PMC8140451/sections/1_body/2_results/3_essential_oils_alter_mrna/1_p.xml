<p id="Par35">At inflammation, BV-2 cells increase the production of the proinflammatory cytokines. Experiments were carried out to reveal whether thyme essential oil chemotypes and standards were able to ameliorate the effect of 24 h LPS pretreatment on the IL-6 and TNFα secretions of the BV-2 cells. Geraniol and thujanol chemotypes decreased the mRNA level of IL-6, while among the standards only geraniol was able to downregulate the IL-6 mRNA expression (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). At mRNA level, all three essential oil chemotypes decreased significantly the TNFα expression. Treatments with linalool and geraniol standards also resulted in the downregulation of TNFα mRNA levels (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). Linalool chemotype decreased IL-6 secretion of BV-2 cells after LPS pretreatment suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect of this essential oil (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). Geraniol and thujanol chemotypes could not decrease IL-6 production compared to the LPS treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). In case of TNFα cytokine linalool, geraniol and thujanol chemotypes successfully reduced the TNFα secretion (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). Between the standards, linalool and geraniol significantly decreased both IL-6 and TNFα productions of the BV-2 cells, while thujanol was ineffective (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b).
