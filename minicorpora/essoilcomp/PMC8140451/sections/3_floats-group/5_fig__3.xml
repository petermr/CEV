  <p>Effects of essential oils on mRNA and protein levels of IL-6 and TNFα after LPS pretreatment. BV-2 cells were pretreated with 1 μg/mL LPS for 24 h then 200-fold diluted essential oil chemotypes and standards were added to the pretreated BV-2 cells for 24 h. DMSO treatment was used as a control of the treated cells. Real-time PCR was performed with SYBR green protocol using IL-6 and TNFα specific primers. β-actin was used as housekeeping gene for the normalization and relative expression of controls was considered as 1. Proinflammatory cytokine secretions were determined using IL-6 or TNFα specific ELISA kits according to the manufacturer’s protocols. 
   <bold>a</bold> Relative mRNA expressions of IL-6 and TNFα of the LPS pretreated cells. 
   <bold>b</bold> IL-6 and TNFα ELISA measurements from the supernatant of the LPS pretreated BV-2 cells. The bars represent mean values and error bars represent standard deviation (SD) for three independent determinations (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3). Real-time PCR and ELISA measurements were carried out in triplicate in each independent experiments. Asterisks indicate 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 compared to the control. Crosses show
