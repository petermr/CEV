  <p>Effects of LPS and essential oil co-treatments on mRNA and protein levels of IL-6 and TNFα cytokines. BV-2 cells were treated with 1 μg/mL LPS and 200-fold diluted essential oils for 24 h. DMSO treatment was used as a control of the treated cells. Real-time PCR was performed with SYBR green protocol using IL-6 and TNFα specific primers. β-actin was used as housekeeping gene for the normalization and relative expression of controls was considered as 1. Proinflammatory cytokine secretions were determined using IL-6 or TNFα specific ELISA kits according to the manufacturer’s protocols. 
   <bold>a</bold> Relative mRNA expressions of IL-6 and TNFα of the co-treated cells. 
   <bold>b</bold> IL-6 and TNFα ELISA measurements from the supernatant of the co-treated BV-2 cells. The bars represent mean values and error bars represent standard deviation (SD) for three independent determinations (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3). Real-time PCR and ELISA measurements were carried out in triplicate in each independent experiments. Asterisks indicate
