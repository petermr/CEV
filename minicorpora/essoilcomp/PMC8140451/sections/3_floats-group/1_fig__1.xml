  <p>Cell viability determinations of the treated BV-2 cells. Viability of the BV-2 cells was measured using CCK-8 cell viability assay after the 6 h and 24 h long treatments with DMSO, chemotypes or standards. Viability is expressed as percentile of the total cell number of the control cells. 
   <bold>a</bold> Cell viability measurements of BV-2 cells treated with DMSO or essential oil chemotypes. 
   <bold>b</bold> Cell viability measurements of BV-2 cells treated with DMSO or essential oil standards. The bars represent mean values and error bars represent standard deviation (SD) for four independent determinations (
   <italic>n</italic> = 4). Cell viability assays were carried out in triplicate in each independent experiments. Asterisks indicate 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 compared to the DMSO treated cells used as controls
