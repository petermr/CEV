  <p>Western blot analyses of NFκB and phospho-C/EBPβ signalling pathways regulating proinflammatory cytokine production of BV-2 cells. BV-2 cells were fractionated immediately after collection and protein contents of the fractions were determined. The same amount of protein from each sample was loaded onto SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes then the membranes were probed with NFκB/p50, NFκB /p65 or P-C/EBPβ polyclonal rabbit antibodies according to the manufacturer’s protocol. β-actin was used as housekeeping control. 
   <bold>a</bold> Protein levels of p50, p65 and P-C/EBPβ after LPS pretreatment. 
   <bold>b</bold> Protein levels of p50, p65 and P-C/EBPβ after essential oil pretreatment. 
   <bold>c</bold> Protein levels of p50, p65 and P-C/EBPβ after LPS and essential oil co-treatment. 
   <bold>d-f</bold> Optical densities of the Western blot analyses of p50, p65 and P-C/EBPβ after the different treatments. The Western blots were analysed using ImageJ software, the optical density of the examined proteins was expressed as percentage of target protein/β-actin abundance. The bars represent mean values and error bars represent standard deviation (SD) for three independent experiments (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3). Asterisks indicate 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 compared to the control. Crosses show 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 compared to the LPS treatment. The protein samples from the same experiment were separated on different gels and only the target protein is visible on the blot used for the figure. Full-length blots are presented in Supplementary Fig.
