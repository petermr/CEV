<p>The drying kinetics were measured at 40, 50 and 60 °C using 12.03 ± 0.05 g of fresh leaves. All assays were conducted in duplicate for 390 min using a convection oven (model SL-102, Solab, Piracicaba, São Paulo, Brazil) until reaching the equilibrium moisture content. The moisture content was determined according to the standard methods of analysis [
