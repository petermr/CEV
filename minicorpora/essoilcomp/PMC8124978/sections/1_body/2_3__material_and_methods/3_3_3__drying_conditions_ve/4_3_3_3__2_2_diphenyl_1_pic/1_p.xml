<p>The antioxidant activity of the essential oils was evaluated using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging method. A stock solution of DPPH (0.5 mM) was prepared in ethanol. The solution was diluted to approximately 60 µM, measuring an initial absorbance of 0.62 ± 0.02 at 517 nm at 22 °C. The absorbance was measured at the start of the reaction, every 5 min during the first 30 min, and then at 30 min intervals until a constant absorbance value (plateau of reaction, 2 h). Each essential oil sample (50.0 µL, 20 mg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) was mixed with a Tween 20 solution (0.5%, 50 µL, 
 <italic>w/w</italic>), and added to DPPH (0.5 mM, 1900 µL) in ethanol. The control sample was prepared in the same conditions, replacing the essential oil sample by ethanol. The standard curves were prepared using Trolox (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid) (Sigma-Aldrich, San Luis, Missouri, USA) at concentrations of 30 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, 60 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, 150 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, 200 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, and 250 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. The DPPH inhibition percentage and total antioxidant activity were expressed as milligrams of Trolox (mgTE·g
 <sup>−1</sup>), as described by Choi et al. (2000) [
