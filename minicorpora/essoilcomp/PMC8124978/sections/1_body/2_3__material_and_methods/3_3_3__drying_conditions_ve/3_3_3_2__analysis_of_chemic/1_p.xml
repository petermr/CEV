<p>The chemical composition was analyzed with gas-phase chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/MS) using a Shimadzu QP 2010 Plus System (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan), equipped with silica capillary columns (DB-5MS, length of 30 m, inner diameter of 0.25 mm, and film thickness of 0.25 μm); carrier gas: helium, linear velocity: 36.5 cm·s
 <sup>−1</sup>; type of injection: splitless (solution of 2 μL of oil in 500 μL of hexane); injector temperature: 250 °C, temperature range: 60 °C to 250 °C, gradient of 3 °C·min
 <sup>−1</sup>; electron impact mass spectrometry: 70 eV; ion source temperature and connection parts: 220 °C. The quantification of each component was performed by peak-area normalization using a flame ionization detector (GC-FID, QP 2010 system, Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) under the same conditions as GC/MS, except for the carrier gas, which was hydrogen.
