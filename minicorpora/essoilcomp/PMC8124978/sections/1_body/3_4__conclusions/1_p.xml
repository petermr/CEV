<p>The study of drying kinetics provides data for the selection of the type of dryer as well as the best operating drying conditions. Midilli was the best model to describe the drying kinetics of 
 <italic>L. thymoides</italic> leaves. In the present study, the drying conditions reached an appropriate moisture content for safe storage. The highest yields of essential oil were obtained from leaves that were dried at 40 °C and 50 °C after drying for 390 min. The chemical composition showed a similar quantitative profile for all the drying conditions (40, 50 and 60 °C), but it differed from the chemical composition of the fresh material.
