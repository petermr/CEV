A previous study investigated the antioxidant activity of some pure essential oil components using lipid model systems and concluded that phenolic compounds were efficient antioxidants and that thymol was one of the most active components in the class of oxygenated monoterpenes [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-02621" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Furthermore, thymol has been indicated as an alternative to synthetic antioxidants in the food matrix [
