<p>The drying process can directly affect the composition and yield of essential oils, but this varies according to each species and drying method applied. In the present study, we evaluated for the first time the effect of the air temperature on the thin-layer drying kinetics and the influence of different drying conditions on the chemical composition, yield, and antioxidant activity of the essential oil of
