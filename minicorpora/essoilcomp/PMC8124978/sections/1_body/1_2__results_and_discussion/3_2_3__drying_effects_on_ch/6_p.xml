<p>Other studies have also evaluated the effect of drying on monoterpene content and reported an effect similar to that described in the present study. Mashkani et al. (2018) [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-26-02621" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] evaluated different drying methods for 
 <italic>Thymus daenensis</italic> and observed that when compared with fresh plants, oven-drying at 35 Â°C after a pre-drying operation resulted in a higher content in monoterpene hydrocarbons and reduced the oxygenated monoterpenes (especially the content of thymol and carvacrol) [

 <xref rid="B54-molecules-26-02621" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] subjected the aerial flowering parts of 
 <italic>Lippia citriodora</italic> to different drying methods and observed that during oven-drying, the percentage of monoterpene hydrocarbons increased and those of oxygenated monoterpenes decreased with an increase in the drying temperature [
