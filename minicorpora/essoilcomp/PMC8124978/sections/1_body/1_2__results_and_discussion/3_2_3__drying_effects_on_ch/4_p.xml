<p>These results confirmed that regardless of the applied drying temperature (40, 50 and 60 Â°C), the essential oils extracted from the dried leaves had a similar chemical profile and formed Group 1. The percentages of monoterpene hydrocarbons increased in essential oils extracted from leaves after the drying process when compared to fresh leaves. However, for the class of oxygenated monoterpenes, a reduction in their contents was detected when compared to oil extracted from fresh leaves (control). This variation may have favored the formation of Group 2, composed only by the chemical constituents of the fresh leaves, which was confirmed by the analysis of the dendrogram in
