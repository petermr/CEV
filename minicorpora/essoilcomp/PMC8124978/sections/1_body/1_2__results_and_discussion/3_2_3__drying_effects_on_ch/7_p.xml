<p>The thymol content decreased after the drying process when compared to the content presented in the fresh leaves. Similarly, Calín-Sánchez et al. (2013) [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-26-02621" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] evaluated the effects of different methodologies and temperatures in the chemical composition of 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> essential oils, which presented high levels of thymol. They found 732 mg·100g
 <sup>−1</sup> of thymol in the fresh leaves and after oven-drying, the levels changed to 571 mg·100g
 <sup>−1</sup> (40 °C), 479 mg·100g
 <sup>−1</sup> (50 °C), and 451 mg·100g
 <sup>−1</sup> (60 °C) [

 <italic>Lippia origanoides</italic>, Queiroz et al. (2018) [
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-26-02621" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] also observed a reduction in thymol content after the drying process [
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-26-02621" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Therefore, the authors found that the drying process promoted a reduction in the levels of thymol, which corroborate with our results.
