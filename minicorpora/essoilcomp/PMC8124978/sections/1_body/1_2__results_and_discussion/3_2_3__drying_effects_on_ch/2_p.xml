<p>Besides thymol, the main components identified in the 
 <italic>L. thymoides</italic> essential oil were 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (2.97 ± 2.79%–8.97 ± 0.64%), γ-terpinene (2.75 ± 3.55%–12.36 ± 4.64%), thymyl acetate (4.92 ± 0.10%–7.22 ± 2.30%), and 
 <italic>E</italic>-caryophyllene (5.21 ± 0.44%–8.84 ± 1.10%). The oxygenated monoterpenes were the predominant chemical class, reaching the highest level in fresh leaves (72.95 ± 2.89%). These results were in agreement with previously published data on the composition of
