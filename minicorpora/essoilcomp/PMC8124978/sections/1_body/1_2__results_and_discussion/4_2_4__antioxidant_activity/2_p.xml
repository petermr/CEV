<p>Although the chemical composition of the essential oils extracted after drying presented high similarity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02621-f002">Figure 2</xref>B), only the oils of 
 <italic>L. thymoides</italic> extracted from dried leaves at 40 °C and 60 °C inhibited the DPPH radical in a statistically similar manner (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02621-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Natural products such as extracts and essential oils are formed by a complex mixture of organic compounds that act synergistically, increasing the biological activity or even antagonistically, thus reducing the verified activity, so identifying the compounds involved with a given biological response represents a methodological challenge [

 <xref rid="B59-molecules-26-02621" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Based on this, we conjecture that this variation in the results of DPPH inhibition percentage for the dried leaves could be involved with the synergist or antagonist effects (

 <italic>Trachyspermum ammia</italic> essential oil could be associated with the strong synergism between the monoterpenes (
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene and 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene), the phenolic monoterpenes (thymol), and the oxygenated monoterpenes [
