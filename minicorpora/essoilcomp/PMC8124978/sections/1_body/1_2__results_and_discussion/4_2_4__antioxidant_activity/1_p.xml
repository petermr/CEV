The variation in drying temperature did not show a defined trend in the results of antioxidant activity, but the highest percentage of inhibition of the DPPH radical was observed for the essential oil sample from the fresh material (89.97 ± 0.31%), which presented the highest percentage of thymol (62.78%, 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02621-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In our study, we observed that the samples of the essential oils obtained after the drying process showed lower antioxidant activity, which may be associated with lower levels of thymol. A previous study investigated the antioxidant activity of some pure essential oil components using lipid model systems, and the authors concluded that the phenolic compounds were efficient antioxidants and they considered thymol as one of the most active components in the class of oxygenated monoterpenes [
