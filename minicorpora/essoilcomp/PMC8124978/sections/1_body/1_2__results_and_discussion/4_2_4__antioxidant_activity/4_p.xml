<p>Few studies have reported the antioxidant profile of the essential oil of the species 
 <italic>L. thymoides</italic>. Silva et al. (2016) [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-02621" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] applied scavenging of the DPPH free radical and β-carotene bleaching tests to determine the antioxidant potential of the 
 <italic>L. thymoides</italic> essential oil, rich in 
 <italic>E</italic>-caryophyllene (17.22–26.27%). The authors did not find a satisfactory antioxidant activity for the essential oil, with EC
 <sub>50</sub> (concentration that caused 50% of the DPPH radical scavenging) values more than 236 mg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup> in the DPPH assay and a reduction of less than 11% in the β-carotene bleaching test [
