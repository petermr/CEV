<p>Essential oils with high thymol contents have been evaluated for their DPPH radical scavenging activities such as the essential oil from 
 <italic>Trachyspermum ammia</italic> [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-02621" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This essential oil showed robust antioxidant activity, which may be associated with its high content of thymol (40.25%). Using the DPPH method, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> were 54 ± 3.2 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and 90 ± 5.4 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup> for the essential oil and thymol, respectively [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-02621" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The essential oil of oregano (
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic>) with thymol (45%) and carvacrol (37.4%) as the major compounds was subjected to DPPH radical scavenging tests and resulted in IC
 <sub>50</sub> values between 0.76 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and 0.33 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, indicating that this essential oil is an interesting natural source of antioxidant compounds with applications in the chemical, pharmaceutical, cosmetics, and food industries [
