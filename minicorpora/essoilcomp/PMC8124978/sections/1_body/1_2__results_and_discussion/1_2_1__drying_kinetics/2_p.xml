<p>Kucuk et al. (2014) [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-26-02621" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] reported that different models have been applied to predict drying conditions of several products [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-26-02621" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The Midilli model presented the best fit of the experimental drying data at different temperatures (
