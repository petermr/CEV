<p>According to 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02621-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, for the Lewis, Diffusion approach, and Henderson &amp; Pabis models, the “
 <italic>k</italic>” values increased as the drying temperature increased. However, for the Page and Midilli models, the temperature variation (40, 50 and 60 °C) did not cause a defined trend in the values of “
 <italic>k</italic>”. The parameter “
 <italic>k</italic>” is defined as the constant of drying (min
 <sup>−1</sup>) and according to Dorneles et al. (2019) [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-26-02621" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], it is related to the effective diffusivity during the falling period of kinetic drying, in which liquid diffusion controls the process [
