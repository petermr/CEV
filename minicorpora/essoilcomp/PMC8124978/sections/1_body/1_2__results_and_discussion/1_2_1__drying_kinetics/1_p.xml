<p>The initial moisture content of 
 <italic>L. thymoides</italic> fresh leaves was 68.15 ± 0.01% on a wet basis. At the end of the drying process, the moisture content was 31.28 ± 1.51% for the 40 °C conditions, 12.34 ± 0.09% at 50 °C, and 9.29 ± 0.07% at 60 °C. During the drying of 
 <italic>L. thymoides</italic> leaves, the moisture ratio decreased exponentially, and an increase in the air temperature led to higher water removal from plant matrices (
