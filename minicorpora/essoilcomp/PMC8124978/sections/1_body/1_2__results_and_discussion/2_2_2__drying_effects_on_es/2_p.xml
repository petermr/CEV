<p>Considering the storage structures found in different organs and the volatile constituents of the aromatic plants, the selection of the appropriate drying methods is important because drying can affect the yield and the chemical composition of the essential oil [

 <xref rid="B48-molecules-26-02621" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. We did not find previous studies evaluating the effect of different drying conditions on the yield of essential oil of 
 <italic>L. thymoides</italic>, however, Ebadi et al. (2015) [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-26-02621" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] investigated the drying of 
 <italic>Lippia citriodora</italic> leaves using different methodologies including oven-drying (40, 50, and 60 °C), and they found that the increase in temperature generated damage to glandular trichomes, which may have favored the loss of volatiles and the reduction in the yield [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-26-02621" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Mashkani et al. (2018) [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-26-02621" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] subjected the leaves of 
 <italic>Thymus daenensis</italic> to different drying methods (sun and shade, oven, microwave, and vacuum drying) and observed that, in general, there was a reduction in the yield of essential oils at increased temperatures [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-26-02621" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Alves et al. (2015) [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-26-02621" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] investigated the influence of 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> leaf-drying on the yield and composition of the essential oil and observed that the oil yield decreased linearly over eight days at 40 °C (6.0% to 3.9%) [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-26-02621" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Therefore, an increase in the temperature contributes to high evaporation rates, which can damage the cells that store the essential oil, intensifying the release of volatile compounds and resulting in lower yields after extraction.
