<p>The drying conditions had a significant effect on the yield of the essential oils (

 <xref rid="molecules-26-02621-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The yield obtained from fresh leaves of 
 <italic>L. thymoides</italic> was similar to the yield obtained by drying for 390 min at 60 °C (0.50% on average). The highest yields were obtained for dried leaves at 40 °C and 50 °C (0.74% on average). Therefore, according to the experimental conditions here described, to achieve better yields, it is necessary to reduce the moisture content of 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>thymoides</italic> leaves, but the samples should be dried at temperatures in the range of 40 to 50 °C. At higher temperatures such as 60 °C, there is a greater loss in the components by volatilization, resulting in lower yields during extraction.
