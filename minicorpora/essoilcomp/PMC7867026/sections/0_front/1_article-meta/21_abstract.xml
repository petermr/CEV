 <p>The sesquiterpenes selina-1,3,7(11)-trien-8-one and oxidoselina-1,3,7(11)-trien-8-one were isolated from the essential oil of 
  <italic>Eugenia uniflora</italic> L. leaves. The structures were elucidated using spectrometric methods (UV, GCâ€“MS, NMR, and specific optical rotation). The relationship between antioxidant activity, as determined by DPPH assay, and the cytotoxic effect was evaluated using tumor cells, namely lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells (A549) and human hepatoma carcinoma cells (HepG2), as well as a model of normal human lung fibroblast cells (IMR90). Both compounds did not show prominent free-radical scavenging activity according to DPPH assay, and did not inhibit lipid peroxidation in Wistar rat brain homogenate. The isolated compounds showed pro-oxidative effects and cytotoxicity in relation to the IMR90 cell line.
