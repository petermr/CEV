<p>The in vitro cytotoxic effect of 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> compounds were analyzed in relation to A549 (lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells—BCRJ code: 0033), HepG2 (human hepatoma carcinoma cells—BCRJ code: 0291), and IMR90 (human lung fibroblast—BCRJ code: 0118) cell lines using MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) (Sigma-Aldrich, COD—M5655) assay [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-26-00740" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium/Nutrient Mixture F-12 Ham (Sigma-Aldrich, COD—D8900), with added 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, COD—16000044) and 100 IU penicillin/100 µg streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, COD—P4333). The cell lines were grown in a humidified incubator at 37 °C containing 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Briefly, the cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well (HepG2 and A549), 5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/well (IMR90), 100 μL/well, and after 24 h, the cells were treated with 100 μL of serial concentrations (10–500 μM) of compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> for 48 h. The stock solution of extracts contained 5% of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a final concentration of 0.2% in cell medium for all in vitro assays. The IC
 <sub>50</sub>, GI
 <sub>50</sub>, and LC
 <sub>50</sub> parameters were performed in accordance with the method described by do Carmo (2018) [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-00740" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], in which IC
 <sub>50</sub> is the concentration of the agent that inhibits growth by 50%, calculated as (T/C) × 100 = 50, where T = number of cells at time t of treatment; C = control cells at time t of treatment; GI
 <sub>50</sub> is the concentration of the agent that inhibits growth by 50% relative to untreated cells, calculated as ((T − T0)/(C − T0)) × 100 = 50, where T and C are the number of treated and control cells, respectively, at time t of treatment, and T &gt; T0 where T0 is the number of cells at time zero; LC
 <sub>50</sub> is the concentration of the agent that results in a net loss of 50% cells relative to the number at the start of treatment, calculated as ((T − T0)/T0) × 100 = −50, where T &lt; T0. The experiments were conducted in quadruplicate on three different days to assure the reproducibility of the generated data.
