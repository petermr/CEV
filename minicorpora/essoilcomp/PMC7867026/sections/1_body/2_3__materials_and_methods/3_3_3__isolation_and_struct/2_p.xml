<p>Structural identification of the compounds was carried out by spectroscopic analysis. Optical rotation measurements were determined on a Perkin-Elmer 343 polarimeter. UV spectra (in CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>) were measured on a Varian Cary 50 spectrophotometer. 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker Ascend 400 MHz spectrometer using CDCl
 <sub>3</sub> and tetramethylsilane as internal reference. Signal assignments in NMR spectra were made by combining the 1D and 2D techniques, correlation spectroscopy (COSY), heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC), and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC) and by comparison with data published in the literature.
