<p>In order to assess the in vitro antioxidant/oxidant potential of 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold>, intracellular ROS generation was measured using a fluorescence technique as described by Carmo (2019) [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-00740" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Briefly, A549 cancer cells (6 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>/well) and IMR90 normal cells (2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>/well) were exposed to concentrations of 10, 50, and 100 μg/mL of 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> compounds, culture medium (negative control), and 15 μmol/L H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (positive control), for 1 h in DCFH-DA solution (25 mmol/L), at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Subsequently, cells were washed with PBS and a H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> solution (15 μmol/L) added for recording of fluorescence. Intracellular fluorescence intensity of cells was measured at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and at an emission wavelength of 538 nm [
