<p>For the oil analyses by GC–MS (Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 Plus Gas Chromatograph), a non-polar Rtx-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) and the following analytical conditions were used: split ratio of 1/20, 250 °C for the injector, 250 °C for the ion source, and 280 °C for the interface. The oven temperature was programmed to 60 °C for the first 5 min, increasing at a rate of 3 °C/min to reach the final temperature of 240 °C. The components were identified based on the relative retention indices calculated using a series of n-alkanes (C8–C19) and the mass spectra from the apparatus database, followed by comparison with the published data [
