 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-00740" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. To evaluate the capacity of hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) of the isolated compounds, male Wistar rat brain homogenate was used as substrate for the production of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) produced by Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>-induced oxidation undertaken at 37 Â°C, following the experimental conditions described elsewhere [
