<p>Compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> were evaluated for their antioxidant potential using the DPPH assay, and the results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00740-f002">Figure 2</xref>. It is noteworthy that compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> present insignificant free-radical scavenging activity. Regarding the inhibition of lipoperoxidation in rat brain homogenate, the compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> did not show inhibitory activity at 40 mg/L. Thus, it is clear that compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> do not present significant antioxidant activity through either single-electron transfer or hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanisms. Garmus (2014) evaluated the antioxidant activity of the essential oil extracted from 
 <italic>E. uniflora</italic> leaves and found that phenolic compounds found in the oil are mainly responsible for the antioxidant effect (determined using the DPPH assay). Similarly, Auricchio (2007) studied a hydroalcoholic extract from 
 <italic>E. uniflora</italic> leaves and its inhibition of lipid oxidation in rat brain homogenate and found an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 35 mg/L, which is different from the results obtained herein. Considering the data are obtained using two distinct mechanisms of antioxidant action, it is hypothesized that compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> have no antioxidant potential [
