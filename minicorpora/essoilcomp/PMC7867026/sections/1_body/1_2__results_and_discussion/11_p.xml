<p>Herein, despite their antioxidant effect as pointed out by the DPPH assay, it was clear that both 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> compounds exerted pro-oxidant behavior (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00740-f004">Figure 4</xref>) by inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in non-cancer (IMR90) and malignant (A549) cells, which explains their cytotoxicity observed in cell viability assay. It is known that if ROS levels increase dramatically to toxic concentrations, the JNK (c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases) pathway can be activated, resulting in apoptosis and cell death [

 <italic>E. uniflora</italic> leaves present noticeable antioxidant properties by reducing the intracellular ROS levels and by increasing the reduced glutathione (GSH) content in HaCaT cells [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-00740" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This disagreement may be explained by the chemical profile of a crude extract compared to the isolated compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold>. In this case, the antioxidant effect may have occurred due to the synergistic effects between the bioactive compounds the crude extract, while the oxidative activity shown herein was related to the individual abilities of compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold>. Indeed, our results highlight the high cytotoxicity of compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold>, acting in a more intense way against IMR90 normal cells than cancer cells (A549 and HepG2) because of their pro-oxidant behavior, as observed in the ROS generation assay.
