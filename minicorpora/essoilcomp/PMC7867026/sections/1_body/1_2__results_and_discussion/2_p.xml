<p>Chemical transformations of several of the components of the 
 <italic>E. uniflora</italic> leaf essential oil are known to be caused by the heating conditions commonly used in GC–MS analysis, and a cold method analysis is required for correct composition evaluation [

 <xref rid="B8-molecules-26-00740" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Particularly important for the case of the sample described in the present research are the transformations of germacrene B into γ-elemene, furanediene into curzerene, and germacrone into β-elemenone, noting that compounds

 <bold>2</bold> are stable under the heating conditions used in GC–MS.
