<p>The antioxidant activity measured by chemical and biological assays, together with the cell-based antioxidant activity measurement, clearly indicates that 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> cannot be considered antioxidant agents. Data obtained using chemical antioxidant activity (inhibition of lipid peroxidation and DPPH assay) and the induced ROS generation show that 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> are not able to scavenge free radicals (DPPH, peroxyl and hydroxyl radicals) and decrease intracellular ROS generation. Thus, it is clear that any prospect of compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> having antioxidant action is very limited. In addition, taken all together, results show pro-oxidative effects and cytotoxicity in relation to normal human cells. This poses a toxicological concern for both substances, and the data generated here can be used as a basis for other biological assays that may encompass antioxidant and cytotoxic studies of the compounds [
