<p>Regarding the cytotoxicity assay, the parameters IC
 <sub>50</sub>, GI
 <sub>50</sub>, and LC
 <sub>50</sub> correspond to cell viability, antiproliferative effect, and cell death, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00740-f003">Figure 3</xref>). All cell lines presented IC
 <sub>50</sub> values &gt; 500 µM, except 
 <bold>2</bold> for HepG2 cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 525.4 µM). Following a similar approach, Figueiredo et al. (2019) reported that 
 <italic>E. uniflora</italic> oil, with significant amounts of 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2,</bold> decreased cell viability (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 15.42 µg/mL) of MRC-5 normal cells [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-26-00740" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> promoted, most notably, antiproliferative effects on IMR90 normal cells (GI
 <sub>50</sub> = 184.7 and 14.9 µM, respectively) when compared with A549 (GI
 <sub>50</sub> = 590.8 and 359.3 µM, respectively) and HepG2 (GI
 <sub>50</sub> = 289.2 and 97.5 µM, respectively) cancer cells, indicating high cytotoxicity and low safety in in vitro studies. The lethal concentration (LC
 <sub>50</sub>) for 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> was higher than 500 µM, indicating that it is necessary to use higher concentrations of these compounds to kill half of the cells. In the literature, it is recognized that phenolic compounds can act as either anti- or pro-oxidant agents [
