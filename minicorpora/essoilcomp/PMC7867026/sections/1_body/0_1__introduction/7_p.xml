<p>Given the importance of volatile compounds as bioactive natural products from medicinal and food plants along with the need to track their different biological activities, two sesquiterpenes from the leaves of 
 <italic>E. uniflora</italic>, selina-1,3,7-trien-8-one (
 <bold>1</bold>) and oxidoselina-1,3,7(11)-trien-8-one (
 <bold>2</bold>), were isolated using conventional column chromatography. Structural elucidation was performed using modern spectroscopy and specific optical rotation techniques. We also present, here, the results of antioxidant analyses for the two sesquiterpenes and an assessment of the relationship between antioxidant power and cytotoxic effects in different normal and cancerous human cells.
