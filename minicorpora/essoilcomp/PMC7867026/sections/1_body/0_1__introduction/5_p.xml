<p>Several studies have shown the potential biological activities of 
 <italic>E. uniflora</italic> essential oils. Costa (2010) demonstrated the antifungal activity of essential oils from 
 <italic>E. uniflora</italic> leaves against 
 <italic>Paracoccidioides brasiliensis</italic> for samples presenting curzerene, germacrene D, and germacrene A as the major GC constituents [

 <italic>E. uniflora</italic>, containing 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> as the major compounds, showed antifungal activity against standard strains of 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> [

 <italic>E. uniflora</italic> leaves presenting curzerene and high proportions of 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> according to GC analyses showed relevant hepatoprotective activity, and the therapeutic potential of both compounds for the development of herbal medicines was mentioned [
