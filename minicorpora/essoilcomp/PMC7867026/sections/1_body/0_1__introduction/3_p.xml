<p>Studies on the chemical composition of essential oils from 
 <italic>E. uniflora</italic> leaves show that compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> are not thermosensitive, but some other components can undergo Cope rearrangement transformations during gas chromatography analysis, a method that is proven to be especially inadequate for the analysis of sesquiterpenes such as furanodiene, curzerene, germacrene B, γ-elemene, germacrone, and β-elemenone [
