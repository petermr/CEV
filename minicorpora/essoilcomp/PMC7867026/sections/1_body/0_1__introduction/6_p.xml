<p>Studies evaluating the cytotoxic action of 
 <italic>E. uniflora</italic> essential oils on cancer cell lines have shown promising results. Ogunwande (2005) demonstrated that an essential oil presenting the sesquiterpene 
 <bold>1</bold>, curzerene, atractylone, and furanodiene has cytotoxic and antiproliferative effects in relation to prostatic carcinoma cells (PC-3), hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2), and breast ductal carcinoma cells (578T) [

 <italic>E. uniflora</italic> oils and curzerene in relation to human colon (HCT-116), gastric (AGP-01), melanoma (SKMEL-19), and normal human fibroblast (MRC-5) cell lines. Curzerene showed more significant activity against SKMEL-19 cells, with oil samples that contained 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> in addition to curzerene, germacrene B, caryophyllene oxide, caryophyllene, β-elemene, and γ-elemene as the major compounds showing cytotoxic activity against all cell lines [
