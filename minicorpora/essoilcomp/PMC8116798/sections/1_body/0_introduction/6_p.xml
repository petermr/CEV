<p>Distinct studies previously reported 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>/animal assays with thyme species (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, the profile of phenolic compounds (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Afonso et al., 2020</xref>) and of essential oils (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Tohidi et al., 2019</xref>) from 
 <italic>Thymus</italic> species originating from different parts of the world have been reported. Still, to our knowledge, there is no report concerning the phytochemical composition and antidiabetic effect of 
 <italic>T. serrulatus</italic>. Therefore, this study evaluated the chemical composition, antioxidant potential, and the antihyperglycemic effects of a decoction and of essential oils from 
 <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> origin.
