<p>The anti-hyperglycemic effects of 
 <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> extracts to substantially reduce the elevated levels of blood glucose may be an essential trigger for the development of normal homeostasis during diabetes and its associated complications. Therefore, both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitory assays) and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> methods were employed to evaluate the antihyperglycemic potential of the plant.
