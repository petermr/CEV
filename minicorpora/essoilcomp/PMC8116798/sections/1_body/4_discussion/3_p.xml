<p>Studies show that the increased level of free radicals in the human body is believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes (

In this study, both the aqueous extract and the essential oil showed strong radical scavenging activities in the DPPH assay (%I values of 93.60 ± 0.03% and 94.51 ± 0.08%, respectively) as compared to the other assays. Dessalegn and co-researchers also observed strong scavenging effects by various solvent fractions of another thyme specie endemic to Ethiopia (
