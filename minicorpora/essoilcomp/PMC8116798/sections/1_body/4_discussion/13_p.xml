<p>Oxidative stress results from an increased level of reactive oxygen species in the body, which are believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Kaneto et al., 2010</xref>). Hence, phytochemicals with antioxidant activity can play a significant role in the treatment of diabetes related disorders (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Catarino et al., 2015</xref>). Another approach to treat hyperglycemic condition is to use drugs that lower the glucose absorption by competitively inhibiting intestinal carbohydrate hydrolyzing enzymes and to decrease inflammatory conditions involved in the pathology of type 2 diabetes (

Further, the phytochemicals present in the plant may also have the properties to increase secretion of insulin by stimulating or regenerating the β-cells of islets of Langerhans, which may finally improve the activity of carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes toward the re-establishment of normal BGL (

The antidiabetic prospective associated with flavones including apigenin and luteolin glycosides are known to enhance insulin action, augment the expression and transcriptional activation of PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) target genes, reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in muscle and promote translocation of GLUT4 (
