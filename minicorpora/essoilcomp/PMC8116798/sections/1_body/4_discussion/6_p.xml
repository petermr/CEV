<p>In the hypoglycemic study, we observed that the aqueous extract, at a dose of 300 mg/kg and 600 mg/kg, significantly lowered BGL compared to negative control in normal mice. Contrary to our results, 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Shewasinad et al. (2018)</xref> reported that the administration of a methanolic leaf extract of 
 <italic>T. serpyllum</italic> to mice caused no significant hypoglycemic effects in mice at all doses. However, the acute oral administration of aqueous extract of 
 <italic>T. serpyllum</italic> leaves (at the dose of 500 mg/kg) showed significant hypoglycemic effect on normoglycemic mice (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Alamgeer et al., 2016</xref>), which indicates that the effect might be due to the polar phytochemicals present in the aqueous fraction (

 <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> essential oil showed no considerable hypoglycemic effect, suggesting that the mechanism of antidiabetic action of the essential oil might differ from that of the aqueous extract and of the standard drug glibenclamide, which acts by stimulating the pancreatic β-cells to secrete insulin (
