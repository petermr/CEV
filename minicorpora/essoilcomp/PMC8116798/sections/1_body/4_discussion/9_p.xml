<p>The aqueous extract at the dose of 600 mg/kg was found to have maximum antihyperglycemic activity (44.14%), followed by the essential oil (30.82%) at the same dose level. This may be explained by the fact that, the test samples are known to exhibit their maximum potential effect at the highest dosage with time against STZ induced diabetes (

In this sense, the antihyperglycemic properties of the aqueous extract and essential oil of the plant may be related to the presence of high concentration plant secondary metabolites, especially phenolic acids and other polyphenols (in the aqueous extract), and isomeric phenolic monoterpenes thymol and carvacrol in the essential oil (
