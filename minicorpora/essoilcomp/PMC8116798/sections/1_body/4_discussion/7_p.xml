<p>The oral glucose tolerance test, also referred to as the glucose tolerance test, measures the body’s ability to metabolize glucose or clear it out of the bloodstream. The aqueous extract, essential oil, and glibenclamide significantly reduced BGL level in mice by 36.99% (600 mg/kg), 47.19% (300 mg/kg), and 60.45% (10 mg/kg), respectively, as compared to the negative control group. The significant reduction in the BGL registered in the treated groups suggests that both the test substances elicited an increase in glucose utilization and glucose tolerance by the body tissues in mice, which indicates an improved glucose homeostasis (
