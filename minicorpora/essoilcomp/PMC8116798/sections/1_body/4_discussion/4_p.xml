<p>The free radical scavenging activity of the aqueous extract could be due to the higher content of polyphenolic components like phenolic acids (especially caffeic acid derivatives, mainly salvianolic acids and rosmarinic acid) (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Pereira et al., 2013b</xref>) and flavones (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Catarino et al., 2015</xref>). In fact, these classes of phytochemicals have strong antioxidant potential, which are positively correlated with DPPH• scavenging activity (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). On the other hand, the antioxidant capacity of the essential oil might be related to its high content of the phenolic monoterpene thymol. This is consistent with the work of Kulisic and coworkers, who reported a high antioxidant activity for the 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> essential oil, which is a thymol chemotype oil (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Kulisic et al., 2005</xref>). The results of this research support the idea that thymol is a stronger antioxidant than carvacrol, due to the greater steric hindering effects of the phenolic group of the latter (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Gedikoğlu et al., 2019</xref>). It is known that any imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants leads to the condition known as “oxidative stress” that results in the development of a pathological condition in the body, including diabetes. However, please note that even widely used as a fast and reliable parameter to evaluate the general radical scavenging activity of plant extracts (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Ullah et al., 2016</xref>), 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assays lack biological relevance, which must be established through 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies.
