<p>Mice with severe hyperglycemia tend to lose a large percentage of their weight after injection of STZ (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Ye, et al., 2011</xref>). The aqueous extract and essential oil at 600 mg/kg dose level significantly prevented weight loss in mice (−1.96% and −2.65%, respectively) comparable to glibenclamide (−1.25%). Similar findings were also observed on the aqueous leaf extract of

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Kabbaoui et al., 2016</xref>). Some studies suggest that increase in body weight could be attributed to the protective effect of the plant extract against degradation of structural proteins, lipids, and muscle wasting, possibly due to improvement of glycemic control via enhancement of insulin secretion or/and action (
