<p>Regarding the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> carbohydrate digestive enzyme inhibitory studies, the essential oil showed potent α-amylase inhibitory activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.01 ± 0.00 mg/ml) as compared to the antidiabetic drug acarbose (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.05 ± 0.02 mg/ml) and the aqueous extract (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 24.47 ± 0.29 mg/ml). Likewise, the essential oil also demonstrated the highest α-glucosidase inhibitory (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.11 ± 0.01 mg/ml) activity. Previous studies showed a similar trend in terms of α-glucosidase inhibitory activity of 
 <italic>T. albicans</italic>, 
 <italic>T. carnosus</italic> and 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oils (

On the other hand, the aqueous extract revealed better inhibitory activity against α-glucosidase (about 10 times greater) than the α-amylase inhibitory activity. Therefore, the antihyperglycemic effect of the aqueous extract could be partly associated with its ability to inhibit α-glucosidase, which delays the postprandial rise in blood glucose by retarding the digestion of carbohydrate (

A more effective digestive enzyme inhibitor is expected when it shows mild inhibitory activity for α-amylase but strongly inhibit α-glucosidase enzyme as intestinal disorders such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and flatulence occur as result of complete inhibition of α-amylase enzyme. This occurs because the starch undigested by the enzyme is used by the intestinal microflora, resulting in gas formation (

 <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> to control postprandial hyperglycemia via the inhibition carbohydrate digestive enzymes that offer an attractive strategy by delaying glucose absorption and which can potentially slow down the progression of diabetes.
