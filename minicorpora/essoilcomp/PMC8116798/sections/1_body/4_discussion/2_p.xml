<p>The principal constituents of the essential oil were the phenolic monoterpene isomers thymol (56.24%) and carvacrol (15.44%). The findings are in line with a previous study showing that the percent composition of the essential oils of the same plant collected from Ofla and Alamata (South Tigray) were dominated by thymol 49.6 and 65.6% respectively, but the findings differ from those collected from Yilma Densa (West Gojjam, Amhara) that constituted 80.8% carvacrol (
