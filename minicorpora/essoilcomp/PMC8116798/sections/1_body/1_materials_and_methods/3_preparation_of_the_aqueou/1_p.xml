<p>The aqueous extract was prepared by decoction, according to 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Afonso et al. (2017)</xref>, with adaptations. Aerial parts 
 <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> were shed dried and then powdered. The powdered plant material (20 g) was mixed with distilled water (400 ml) and then boiled for 15 min, left to cool for 5 min, and filtered through Whatman grade 1 filter paper, using a pressurized suction filtration system. Upon concentration 
 <italic>in vacuo</italic> at 40°C, the filtrate was defatted with n-hexane (1:1 v/v). The resulting aqueous extract was freeze-dried, sealed, and kept in a refrigerator for further use. A fresh stock solution was prepared for the experiment whenever required.
