<p>The phenolic compounds in 
 <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> aqueous extract were identified by UHPLC-DAD-ESI-MS
 <sup>n</sup> analysis, performed on a Ultimate 3000 (Dionex Co., Sunnyvale, CA, United States) apparatus equipped with an ultimate 3000 Diode Array Detector (Dionex Co.), and coupled to a mass spectrometer, according to the method previously described by 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Pereira et al. (2018)</xref>. The chromatographic apparatus was composed of a quaternary pump, an autosampler, a photodiode-array detector, and an automatic thermostatic column compartment. The column used had a 100 mm length, 2.1 mm i. d., 1.9 µm particle diameter, and end-capped Hypersil Gold C18 column (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States), and its temperature was maintained at 30°C. The solvent system used to analyze the sample include water acidified with 0.1% formic acid (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B). The elution was carried out in binary gradient by gradually increasing the amount of solvent B; from 10–20% (over 6 min), from 20–25% (12 min), from 25–34% (30 min) and increased up to 100% at 37 min maintaining for 3 min, finally returning to the initial conditions at 40 min. The flow rate used was 0.2 ml/min
 <sup>−1</sup>. The UV–Vis spectral data for all peaks accumulated in the range 200–600 nm and the chromatographic profiles were recorded at 280, 320, and 340 nm. The mass spectrometer used was a Thermo LTQ XL (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA, United States) ion trap MS, equipped with an ESI source with Thermo Xcalibur Qual Browser software. The instrument was operated in negative-ion mode and the full scan covered the mass range from 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 100 to 2000. Nitrogen above 99% purity was used and the gas pressure was 520 kPa (75 psi). ESI needle voltage set at 5.00 kV and an ESI capillary temperature of 275°C. CID–MS/MS and MS
 <sup>n</sup> experiments were simultaneously acquired for precursor ions using helium as the collision gas with collision energy of 25–35 arbitrary units.
