<p>The fresh aerial parts (250 g) of 
 <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> were cut into small pieces and distilled (hydro-distillation) for 3 h in Clevenger-type apparatus. The process was repeated 11 times to get enough oil. The essential oil obtained was dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate and kept in closed vials at 4°C in a refrigerator (
