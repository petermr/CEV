<p>The inhibition of the α-glucosidase enzyme was determined according to the method described by 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Vinholes et al. (2011)</xref>, with some adaptations. The enzymatic samples (10 μL) were added in 
 <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenyl-α-D-glycopyranosidium substrate (50 μL, 3.25 mM) (diluted in pH 7.0 phosphate buffer) solution. The enzyme (50 μL, 9.37 U mL
 <sup>−1</sup> diluted in phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) was then added in the mixture to start the reaction followed by incubation of the mixture at 37°C for 10 min. Acarbose was used as a positive control. The absorbance reading was done on polystyrene microplates containing 96 wells in a Spectra Max-Molecular Devices plate reader and was read at a wavelength of 405 nm, immediately after the end of the reaction. The results of inhibitory activity of α-glucosidase enzyme were expressed as IC
 <sub>50</sub>.
