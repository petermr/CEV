<p>The activity of 
 <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> aqueous extract and essential oil against the α-amylase enzyme was assessed using the procedure described by 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Satoh et al. (2015)</xref> with some adaptations. Each extract (15 μL) was mixed with phosphate buffer (50 μL, pH 7.0) and the α-amylase enzyme (12.5 μL, 241.71 U 62 ml
 <sup>−1</sup>), followed by incubation at 37°C for 5 min. The soluble starch as a substrate (62.5 μL) was added to initiate the reaction, and further incubated at 37°C for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 M hydrochloric acid (12.5 μL) to the reaction mixture. Twenty-five μL of the iodine solution (25 μL, 0.005 M) and potassium iodide (0.005 M) was added for color formation. Acarbose was used as a positive control. The absorbance reading was done on polystyrene microplates containing 96 wells (Spectra Max 190-Molecular Devices) at a wavelength of 690 nm. The α-amylase enzyme inhibitory activity of the samples was expressed as IC
 <sub>50</sub> (mg/ml).
