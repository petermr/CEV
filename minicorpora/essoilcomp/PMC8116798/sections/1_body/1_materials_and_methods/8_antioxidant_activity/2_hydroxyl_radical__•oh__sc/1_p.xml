<p>The ability of the samples to scavenge the hydroxyl radical was determined according to the method described by 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Vinholes et al. (2017)</xref> with adaptations. Each test sample (25 μL) was reacted by mixing with 110 μL of iron sulfate heptahydrate solution (8 mM, prepared in EDTA-Na 20 μM), 50 μL of hydrogen peroxide solution (7 mM) and 74 μL of salicylic acid solution (3 mM). Quercetin was used as positive control. After shaking, the microplates were incubated at 37°C for 30 min and the absorbance was read at 515 nm. The results were expressed as inhibition percentage (% I).
