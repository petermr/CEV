<p>The effect of 
 <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> aqueous extract and essential oil against DPPH radical was determined following the method adopted by 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Vinholes et al. (2017)</xref>. In this assay, the sample (25 μL) solution (or methanol, in the case of blank) and 0.6 mM DPPH solution (250 μL) were mixed in a 96-well microplate. Quercetin was used as a positive control. After shaking the microplates, the mixture was incubated in dark for 30 min and subsequently measured on a plate reader (Spectra Max 190) at a wavelength of 515 nm. The results were calculated as inhibition percentage (%I).
