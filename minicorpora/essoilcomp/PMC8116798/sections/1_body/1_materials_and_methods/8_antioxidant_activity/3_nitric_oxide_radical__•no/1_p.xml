<p>The nitric oxide radical scavenging ability of the 
 <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> aqueous extract and essential oil was determined according to the method described by 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Vinholes et al. (2011)</xref>. The samples (50 µL) and sodium nitroprusside (50 μL, 20 mM) were added to a 96-well plate and incubated under the effect of light for 60 min at room temperature. Subsequently, 2% phosphoric acid solution (50 µL) and Griess reagent (50 µL) were added to the mixture and further incubated for 10 min at room temperature in the dark and the absorbance was measured on a micro plate reader (Spectra Max 190), at a wavelength of 562 nm. Quercetin was used as standard. The results were calculated as inhibition percentage (%I).
