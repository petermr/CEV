<p>The essential oil composition of 
 <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> was analyzed by GC-MS according to the adapted method of 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Tirillini et al. (2008)</xref>. For the analysis, a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7820A) equipped with a FID and a capillary column (fused silica DB-5, 30 m × 0.25 mm i. d., 0.25 μm film thickness), coupled with a mass spectrometer (Agilent 5977B) was used. 50 µL of the oil was diluted in 1.5 ml of methanol in order to improve the separation of peaks and the injection volume was 1 µL. The oven conditions were set initially at 60°C and continued for 3 min and then the temperature was increased at 4°C/min to 300°C and held for 15 min. The injector and detector were operated at 250°C, the flow rate of the carrier gas (helium) was adjusted to 1 ml/min and a split ratio of 1:10 was applied. GC-MS system was operated in the EI mode at 70 eV, in the mass range from an 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 30–500 amu.
