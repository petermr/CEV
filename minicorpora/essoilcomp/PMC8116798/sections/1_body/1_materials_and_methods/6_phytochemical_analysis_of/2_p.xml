<p>The identification of compounds was carried out by matching their mass spectra with mass spectral library of NIST (version 2.2) and the identity of each component was confirmed by comparing their retention indices (generated by Chemstation software) relative to the C6-C22 n-alkanes with those from the literature (

 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Tirillini et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Mancini et al., 2015</xref>). Thymol was co-eluted as a standard reference to additionally confirm its identity. The percentage composition of the components was obtained by the peak areas normalization method.
