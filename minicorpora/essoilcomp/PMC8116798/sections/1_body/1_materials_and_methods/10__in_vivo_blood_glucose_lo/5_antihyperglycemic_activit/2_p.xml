<p>The antihyperglycemic activity of 
 <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> aqueous extract and essential oil was performed according to the method described by 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Kabbaoui et al. (2016)</xref>. The mice were equally divided and randomly assigned into nine groups of six mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6) each: 
 <bold>Group 1</bold>: healthy mice received the vehicle (2% tween 80, 10 ml/kg) and served as normal control group. 
 <bold>Group 2</bold>: diabetic mice received a daily oral dose of 2% tween 80 (10 ml/kg), served as diabetic control group. 
 <bold>Groups 3, 4, and 5</bold>: diabetic mice received a daily oral dose of 150, 300, and 600 mg/kg aqueous extract, respectively. 
 <bold>Groups 6, 7, and 8</bold>: diabetic mice received a daily oral dose of 150, 300, and 600 mg/kg of the essential oil respectively. 
 <bold>Group 9:</bold> diabetic mice received a daily oral dose of 10 mg/kg of the standard drug glibenclamide and served as a positive control group. The test samples, standard drug, and vehicle were started 3 days after induction of diabetes and administered orally on a once daily basis for 21 days using oral gavage.
