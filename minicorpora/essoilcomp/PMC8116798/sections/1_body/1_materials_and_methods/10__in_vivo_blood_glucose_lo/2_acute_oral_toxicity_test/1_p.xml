<p>Acute oral toxicity was performed according to OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) guidelines 425. Albino mice of female sex selected by random sampling were fasted for 3–4 h prior to dosing with free access to water. First, 2000 mg/kg dose, dissolved in 2% tween 80, was administered orally to a single mouse for each of the test samples. The mice were then observed for physical or behavioral changes for 24 h with special attention during the first 4 h. Mice were given access to food after 2 h of dosing. After survival of the administered mice for 24 h, four additional mice (for each sample) were administered the same amount of the aqueous extract/essential oil under the same conditions. For any possible toxic effect of the sample, the mice were closely observed in the first 4 h and then at regular intervals up to 14 days.</p>
