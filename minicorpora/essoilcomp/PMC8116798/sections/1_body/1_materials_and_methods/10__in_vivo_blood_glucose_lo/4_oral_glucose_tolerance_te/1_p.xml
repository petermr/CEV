<p>The oral glucose tolerance test was performed according to the procedure described by 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Lanjhiyana et al. (2011)</xref>. Overnight fasted mice were divided into nine groups of six mice in each group (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6). 
 <bold>Group 1</bold> received 10 ml/kg of 2% tween 80 and served as a normal control group and 
 <bold>Group 2</bold> received 2 g/kg of glucose (negative control). 
 <bold>Groups 3, 4, and 5</bold> received aqueous extract of 
 <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> at doses of 150, 300, and 600 mg/kg body weight, and 
 <bold>groups 6, 7, and 8</bold> were given essential oil at doses of 150, 300, and 600 mg/kg body weight. 
 <bold>Group 9</bold> received glibenclamide, 10 mg/kg, and served as a positive control group. Thereafter, a glucose load (2 g/kg body weight) was given to each mouse, except the normal control group, exactly after 30 min post administration of the test samples, standard drug, or vehicle.
