<p>Blood glucose profile of each mouse was measured at five time points: immediately prior to dosing (0 min), 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after administration of glucose in order to determine their BGLs. Blood samples from each mouse were drawn from tail vein, using tail snip method, three to four times and the average blood glucose values were taken. The BGLs were measured using a glucometer. The area under the blood glucose concentration curve (AUC) of each group was determined by plotting BGL against a time graph, and it was used to evaluate the overall percentage reduction in post glucose load hyperglycemia.</p>
