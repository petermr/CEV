<p>The extraction yield of 
 <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> aqueous extract was 11.4% (2.28 g). Overall, its LC-MS analysis allowed the identification of distinct phenolic compounds, being this particularly rich in caffeic acid derivatives and salvianolic acids (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Among them, the two compounds eluted in peaks 19 and 22 were assigned to two isomers of salvianolic acid K, as they exhibited the main [M-H]
 <sup>−</sup> ion at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 555 in MS spectrum and the major product ions at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> at 493 and 359 in MS
 <sup>2</sup> analysis. Notably, these isomers represented almost half (90 mg/g of the extract) of the total quantified phenolic compounds (194.1 ± 15.9 mg/g of the extract). In addition, salvianolic acid B (T
 <sub>R</sub> 27.6 min, MW 718), the derivative of salvianolic acid F (T
 <sub>R</sub> 15.0 and 16.9 min, MW 376) and salvianolic acid A (T
 <sub>R</sub> 34.3 min, MW 494), appeared in moderate amounts. In detail, salvianolic acid B (UV
 <sub>max</sub> at 287 and 330 nm) presented 
 <italic>m/z</italic> at 717 and the fragmentation pattern with successive losses of 198 u (danshensu) or 180 u (caffeic acid) units. Salvianolic acid A produced a base peak at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 295 by the loss of 198 u (danshesu) and other ions characteristics to this salvianolic acid fragmentation.
