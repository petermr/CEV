<p>Flavones, namely, isoscutellarein, luteolin, and apigenin glycosides were also representative phenolic constituents of the extract, accounting for 16%, 10% and 3% of the total phenolic content of the extract, respectively. Among these, isoscutellarein-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucuronide (T
 <sub>R</sub> 27.0 min) was assigned due the UV
 <sub>max</sub> at 268 and 337 nm and the 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 461→285 consistent with the loss of a glucuronyl moiety (−176 u). In a similar way, the fragment ion at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 285 and the UV
 <sub>max</sub> at 254, 264 and 345 nm, compatible with luteolin, and the main ion [M-H]
 <sup>−</sup> at 
 <italic>m/z</italic>, 461 allowed the identification of luteolin-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucuronide (T
 <sub>R</sub> 21.3 min, MW 462), eluted in peak 15. Peak 6 with UV
 <sub>max</sub> compatible with apigenin (271, 333 nm) showed a molecular ion at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 593 and typical 
 <italic>C</italic>-glycosyl fragments at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 473, 503 and 383, allowing the identification of apigenin di-
 <italic>C</italic>-glucoside.
