<p>Rosmarinic acid (MW 360), a well-known dimer of caffeic acid characteristic from 
 <italic>Thymus</italic> plants, and its derivatives overall represented about 15% of the total phenolics. This compound was eluted in peak 18, which showed the [M− H]
 <sup>−</sup> ion at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 359 and the product ions at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 161, 179, 197, 223 in MS
 <sup>2</sup>. Also, two other rosmarinic acid derivatives were found in moderate amounts in the extract. These were eluted in peaks 16 and 17, being characterized by [M− H]
 <sup>−</sup> ions at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 521 and 403, respectively, and the presence of a major product ion at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 359.
