<p>The AUCs of glucose concentration in groups treated with 
 <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> aqueous extract, essential oil, and glibenclamide, were significantly reduced by 36.99% (600 mg/kg), 47.19% (300 mg/kg) and 60.45% (10 mg/kg) respectively, as compared to the negative control group. The essential oil of 
 <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> at all dose levels produced plasma glucose levels significantly lower than those of the aqueous extract at 30, 60, and 120 min after the glucose administration in which the AUC during the OGTT was significantly decreased by 41.35%, 47.19%, and 46.51% at 150, 300, and 600 mg/kg dose levels, respectively.
