<p>The effects of aqueous extract and essential oil of 
 <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> on FBG level in normoglycemic mice is shown in 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. At the lowest dose (150 mg/kg), no significant decrease in blood glucose level was observed in both tested samples. Unlike the essential oil, which did not show any hypoglycemic property at all dose levels, the aqueous extract (at 600 mg/kg) showed statistically significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) reduction in blood glucose level starting from the 3rd h of administration as compared to the negative control. After 6 h of administration, a statistically significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) reduction in blood glucose level was observed at 300 mg/kg of the aqueous extract. Moreover, the effect of 300 mg/kg aqueous extract (22.53%) was comparable with the effect of the standard antidiabetic drug glibenclamide (22.82%) in reducing the blood glucose level. Also, a statistically significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) decrease in the blood glucose level of the positive control group was observed after 1 h of the glibenclamide’s administration.
