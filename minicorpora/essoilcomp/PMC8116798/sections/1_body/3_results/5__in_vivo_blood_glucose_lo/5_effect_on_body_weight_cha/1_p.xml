<p>In this study, the STZ-induced untreated diabetic group showed 19.97% loss in body weight and the normal control group showed a 4.96% increase during the treatment period. In addition to the diabetic group, the group of mice treated with 150 mg/kg of both of the test substances produced substantial reductions in their body weight as compared to the normal mice. The body weight of diabetic mice receiving glibenclamide and those treated with 600 mg/kg of the aqueous extract and essential oil of 
 <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> showed no significant reduction over the experimental time. A dose dependent improvement in the body weight parameter of mice was observed during the experiment (
