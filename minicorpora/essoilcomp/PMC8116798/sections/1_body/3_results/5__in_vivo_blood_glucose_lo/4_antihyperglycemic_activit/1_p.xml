<p>In the three-week treatment course, the fasting blood glucose level of the mice were measured once a week as shown in 
 <xref rid="T6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>. There was no significant difference observed in the fasting blood glucose level between the standard and test groups before initiating the treatment. At the dose of 600 mg/kg, the groups that received standard drug and the test substances showed statistically significant variations in their FBG levels within the first week of treatment (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 and 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, for the aqueous extract and essential oil respectively). Furthermore, at the end of the second week, the test groups that received 600 mg/kg of both aqueous extract and essential oil (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and 300 mg/kg of the essential oil (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) showed significantly different FBG levels at the end of the second week. On day 21, the test groups that received 150 mg/kg (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and 300 mg/kg (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) of the aqueous extract also showed a statistically significant reduction in their FBG levels.
