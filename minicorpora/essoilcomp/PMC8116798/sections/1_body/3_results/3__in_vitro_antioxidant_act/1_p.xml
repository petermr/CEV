<p>The antioxidant potential of the essential oil and aqueous extract were determined on the basis of their scavenging activity of the free radicals, namely against DPPH
 <sup>•</sup>, 
 <sup>•</sup>OH and 
 <sup>•</sup>NO. As presented in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, the essential oil and the aqueous extract were both able to eliminate the DPPH and OH radicals, with higher percentages of inhibition for the DPPH
 <sup>•</sup>. Curiously, essential oil was able to partially scavenge 
 <sup>•</sup>NO (approximately 35%), while no such ability was registered for the aqueous extract and quercetin.
