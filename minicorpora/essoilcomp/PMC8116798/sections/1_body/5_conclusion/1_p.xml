<p>In conclusion, this study suggested that both the aqueous extract and essential oil of 
 <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> have potential antioxidant scavenging ability. Moreover, the two 
 <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> samples hold potency to inhibit α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzymes, which are key metabolic enzymes and targets for diabetes treatment. In addition, the results also demonstrated that 
 <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> was capable of inducing significant antihyperglycemic activities in normoglycemic and STZ induced diabetic mice, as well as of effectively preventing the anticipated body weight loss of the diabetic mice. The overall results suggest that the presence of phenolic constituents in the test samples increased the blood glucose lowering effects of 
 <italic>T. serrulatus</italic>, although further analysis using specific metabolites of these compounds must be tested in order to consolidate such theory. Note also that although the extract and essential oil showed strong radical scavenging activity in different chemical assays, their effectiveness still needs to be evaluated in animal models. We also recommend further investigation to evaluate the anti-diabetic effect of the plant extract and essential oil at lower dose levels to translate the effect closer to a therapeutic value for human studies.
