<p>Analytical gas chromatography (GC) was carried out on a Shimadzu GC17A gas chromatograph with a Megabore column of DB-Wax (60 m × 0.5 mm × 1 µm) which was programmed from 50 to 220 °C at 3 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> with helium as the carrier gas. Injection temperature and detector temperature were both 220 °C. GC integrations were performed on a SMAD electronic integrator. GC–MS was carried out on a Shimadzu GCMS-QP5000 mass spectrometer operating at 70 eV ionization energy. The GC column used was a DB-wax (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm) programmed from 35 to 220 °C at 3 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> with helium as the carrier gas, injection temperature and ion source temperature were both 250 °C. Compounds were identified by their GC retention indices relative to n-alkanes and known compounds and by comparison of their full-scan mass spectra with either known compounds or published spectra [
