<p>According to our results detailed above, the essential oils of 
 <italic>Trachymene incisa</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>incisa</italic> are characterized by a high amount of sesquiterpenes that were the major compounds. The sesquiterepene hydrocarbons were significantly more abundant in the hairy variant in comparison to glabrous form. It may be that three different chemotypes occur, with the typical glabrous variant showing two different chemotypes, characterized by: β-selinene + bicyclogermacrene and γ-bisabolene + α-pinene, while the hairy variant was characterized by bicyclogermacrene + β-caryophyllene.
