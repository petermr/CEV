<p>With this paper, we contribute for the first time to the knowledge of the chemistry of the genus 
 <italic>Trachymene</italic>. It would be interesting to study the effects of climate, light or soil conditions on the chemical composition of this species to confirm the chemotypes described. The diversity of this genus could also be the source of further investigations to characterize their essential oils.
