<p>According to our results, the abundance of trichomes seems to affect the composition of the essential oils of 
 <italic>Trachymene incisa</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>incisa</italic> (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00601-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Although the terpenoid distribution seems similar between both glabrous and hairy variants, the amount of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons is significantly higher in the hairy one (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00601-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Only five populations were analyzed and no climatic or biological conditions were registered. Thus, further study should be done to confirm this or to check if the age of the plant, the presence of pathogen or the climatic condition could affect the chemical composition. Previous reports have confirmed that the phenology of the plant and the growing conditions can affect the essential oils of other species of the same family [
