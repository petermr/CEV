From all the samples analyzed, 47 compounds have been identified, representing from 88.4% to 93.5% of the total oil. The sesquiterpene fraction predominates, both quantitatively and qualitatively, in all the samples examined, with a total of 33 constituents. Sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (48.3–74.8%) were more abundant than oxygenated sesquiterpene (6.59–36.2%). It is worth nothing the low amount of monoterpene fraction and practically the absence of the oxygenated ones, that only appear in T.in.I
 <sub>3</sub> (9.0%). The synthesis of terpenoids is correlated from the lower molecular weight to the higher [

 <xref rid="B31-plants-10-00601" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], so this species has increased the metabolism that produces sesquiterpenes using monoterpenes as precursors. That could explain the low amount of monoterpenes detected. However, it should be interesting to make a seasonal study of the population 3 (T.in.I
 <sub>3</sub>) to know if the amount of α-pinene is constant throughout the cycle of the plant or if it could be conditioned by other factors.
