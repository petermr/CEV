<p>With respect to the chemical composition of the volatile oils, 
 <italic>T. incisa</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>incisa</italic> exhibits the same plasticity in its vegetative and reproductive forms. The typical glabrous variant (T.in.I), showed β-selinene (11.9–36.7%) and bicyclogermacrene (21.5–28.0%) as main compounds in populations 1 and 2. However, the principal components of the hairy variant (T.in.II) were identified as bicyclogermacrene (24.4–34.7%) and β-caryophyllene (10.4–10.8%) in populations 4 and 5, although population 5 also contained a high amount of caryophyllene oxide (12.8%). According to these results, it seems that each variant has a characteristic composition, but population 3 belonging to the typical glabrous variant (T.in.I) showed other chemotype, with γ-bisabolene (27.4%) and α-pinene (19.2%) being the major compounds. According to the main compound, three different chemotypes could be defined: I.—β-selinene + bicyclogermacrene and II.—γ-bisabolene + α-pinene for the typical glabrous variant and III.—bicyclogermacrene + β-caryophyllene for the hairy variant, though more sampling of the species would be needed to confirm this.
