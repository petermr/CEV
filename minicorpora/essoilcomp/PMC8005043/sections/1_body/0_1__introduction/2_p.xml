 <italic>incisa</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00601-f001">Figure 1</xref>) is an erect or ascending perennial herb up to 80 cm high with a thick rootstock. The plants have highly variable dissected basal leaves and one or more rosettes attached to the rootstock. The leaves are sparsely hairy to almost glabrous, the lamina broad ovate, 14–65 mm long, 15–76 mm wide; segments elliptic or linear, 0.5–6 mm wide. Plants have bisexual white flowers, clustered into simple umbels with a mean of 72 flowers per umbel. The fruits are broad ovate and are 2–4 mm long, 2.5–4.0(–7.5) mm wide, brown; occasionally developing only one mericarp. Mericarps are 1.8–2.0(–3.8) mm wide; smooth orbiberculate to papillate schizocarps. It flowers most of the year, peaking between September and April. The dispersal takes place from March to October with no obvious peak. It grows commonly in dry eucalypt woodland or scrub, sclerophyll forest and cleared areas on sandy soils and on rocky granite outcrops and resprouts from the tuberous taproot after fire. It is distributed widely throughout eastern NSW north from Ulladulla and into Queensland [
