<p>The ITS2 sequences were amplified using the following pair of universal primers, ITS5-ITS4 (including both ITS1 and ITS2 regions), ITS5 GGAAGTAAAAGTCGTAACAAGG and ITS4 TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC. Each 50 µL reaction contained 5 µL 10× PCR buffer, 2.5 µL 2.5 mm MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 0.4 µL 0.2 mm deoxyribonucleotides (dNTP), 5 µL of each primer (10 ng·μL
 <sup>−1</sup>), 0.4 µL 0.5 U Taq DNA polymerase (HIMEDIA, Mumbai, India), 40 µL sterile distilled water, and 5 µL genomic DNA (50 ng·μL
 <sup>−1</sup>). The amplification consisted of 94 °C·2 min
 <sup>−1</sup>, followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C·45 s
 <sup>−1</sup>, 50 °C·45 s
 <sup>−1</sup>, and 72 °C·1 min
 <sup>−1</sup>, and ending with 72 °C for 5 min for the final extension. Amplified products were genotyped using 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. Then they were staining with MaestroSafeTM Nucleic Acid Stains (MAESTROGEN, Hsinchu, Taiwan) and visualized under UV transilluminator (BioDoc-It2 imaging systems, Analytik Jena, Thuringia, Germany) before samples were sent to sequencing at Macrogen, Inc. (Seoul, South Korea).
