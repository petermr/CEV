<p>For RAPD analysis of the genomic DNA, 10-base primers from Operon Technologies (Alameda, GA, USA) and UBC (University of British Columbia, Canada) were chosen (

 <xref rid="B43-plants-10-00803" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-plants-10-00803" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-plants-10-00803" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="B46-plants-10-00803" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was adjusted to 10 μL
 <sup>−1</sup> containing 8 μL
 <sup>−1</sup> of OnePCRTM Plus (Genedirex, Taoyuan, Taiwan), 1 μL
 <sup>−1</sup> of 1 μm RAPD primer and 1 μL
 <sup>−1</sup> of 10 ng genomic DNA. All the reactions were carried out on a Flexcycler2 thermal cycler (Analytik Jena, Thuringia, Germany) using the following profile: 1 cycle, 94 °C, 4 min; 40 cycles, 95 °C, 30 s; 37 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 60 s; 1 cycle, 72 °C, 10 min. The sample was separated in a 1.5% agarose gel in 1× TBE buffer. The samples were run at 70 V for 120 min. The gels were then visualized using the BLooK LED transilluminator (Genedirex, Taoyuan, Taiwan).
