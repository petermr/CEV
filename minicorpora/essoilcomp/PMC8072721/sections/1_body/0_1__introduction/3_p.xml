<p>Internal transcribed spacer DNA barcode (ITS2) detects nuclear marker of the rDNA region in nuclear genome that is useful for directly detecting reticulate phenomena. This technique has been reported to be an efficient barcode locus for plant identification [

 <xref rid="B18-plants-10-00803" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and classification by many plant species such as Indian

 <xref rid="B20-plants-10-00803" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and 
 <italic>Dendrobium</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-10-00803" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In addition to the ITS region, RAPD analysis is an alternate method for estimating genetic diversity and relatedness in plant populations, cultivars and germplasm accessions, especially in non-model plant species. By using the markers, the technique is able to amplify DNA from dispersed polymorphic loci and thereby indirectly distinguishes small differences within the gene sequences. To draw accurate conclusion on genetic relations of plants species, it is therefore vital to combine these techniques. There is no research work to-date that fully describe genotyping differences among raw materials for makhwaen essential oil production in relation to their physical properties and aromatic profiles as compared to those of other 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> species. The aim of this research, therefore, is to descriptively establish profile specification of raw materials used in makhwaen essential oil extraction industry.
