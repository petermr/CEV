<p>Genetic and environmental variables—i.e., growing condition, light intensity, day length, temperature, altitude, as well as their interactions—could generally influence the quantity and quality of the essential oils [

Studies on the essential oil containing plants revealed that chemical compositions and characteristics of essential oils from plants within the same genus are diverse such as those belonging to
