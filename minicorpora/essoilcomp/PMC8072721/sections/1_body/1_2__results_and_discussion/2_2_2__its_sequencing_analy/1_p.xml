<p>The aligned lengths of the ITS region (including both ITS1 and ITS2 regions) ranged from 596 bp for MK (
 <italic>Z. myriacanthum</italic>) to 600 bp for HJ (
 <italic>Z. armatum</italic>). Among the five MK sampling (two specimens from Mae Tang district: MK1-1 and MK1-2, one from Mae Rim: MK2 and two from Nan: MK3-1 and MK3-2), the ITS sequences were completely identical whereas 39 single nucleotide polymorphism were found among MK, MKO, and HJ samples. The phylogenetic relationship analysis was investigated based on the total ITS region sequences. The dendrogram showed three major clades (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00803-f001">Figure 1</xref>A), the first formed among five MK samples from the three regions, the second consisted of MKO while the last is HJ. ITS sequence is an efficient tool for genetic identification among species however, very low efficiency for evaluation of genetic variation within the species.
