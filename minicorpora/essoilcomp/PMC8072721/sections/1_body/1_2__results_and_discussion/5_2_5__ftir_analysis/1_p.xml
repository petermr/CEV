<p>Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectrum patterns have been adopted to expose authentically volatile composition of plant essential oils such as those of lavender (
 <italic>Lavandula officinalis</italic>), pepper-mint (
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic>), green doulas (
 <italic>Pseudotsuga menziesii</italic>), fir (

 <sup>−1</sup>. FTIR spectrum scans of the three 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> species essential oil (MK1-3, HJ, and MKO) absorbed light at a wavenumber range of 1722–798 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 2967–2926 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively, therefore illustrating similar light transmission. EO of the HJ on the other hand showed distinct spectrum characteristics from other samples (
