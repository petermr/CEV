<p>Only S6, S7, S9, OPA01, and OPA04 primers gave responses with the DNA thus they were used for the calculation of the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA). Result was illustrated as a dendrogram in which the samples were split into three groups: group 1—HJ, group 2—MKO, and group 3 consisting of MK1-3, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00803-f001">Figure 1</xref>B. The dendrogram illustrated that MK1-3 were clustered as closely related species while HJ and MKO were genetically identified as separated species. Indeed, the RAPD makers revealed slight genetic variables between the 
 <italic>Z. myriacanthum</italic> samples from different geographical regions. The result was correspondent with our taxonomic data described previously. In addition to the ITS sequencing, the RAPD technique was successful to determine the genetic variation of the 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> spp. as well as many plants of this kind including 
 <italic>Z</italic>. 
 <italic>hamiltonianum, Z</italic>. 
 <italic>nitidum, Z</italic>. 
 <italic>oxyphyllum, Z</italic>.
