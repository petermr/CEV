<p>Essential oils were extracted from dried fruits of makhwaen samples from three areas (MK1, MK2, and MK3), huajiao (HJ) and makwoung (MKO) using hydro-distillation. The extraction yield varied by mean of species differentiation i.e., MK1-3 (~7%), followed by HJ (~5%) and MKO (~2%). Thirty-five volatile compounds were detected using GC-MS (
