<p>Demands of high-quality essential oil from raw material of unique plant taxa for food and perfumery production has ramped up recently. Essential oil compositions could assist in genetic analysis of plant species thus the generic term of chemotypes is well perceived [

Based on our result of the chemometric analyses, L-linalool was separated from the others and projected with the HJ similar with the result form the RAPD analysis. Therefore, it could be used indirectly as a marker for characterization of the 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> species. More importantly, the heat mapping of the odor descriptors also convinced that of all the analyzed species, HJ represents the citrusy-floral aroma which is its unique aroma identity. This has been described as the generic perception of Sichuan pepper aroma [

 <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> spp. These compounds offer spice flavor with tingling and numbing sensations [
