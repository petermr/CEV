<p>The relationships between the chemical components and the 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> species were analysed using the PCA in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00803-f002">Figure 2</xref>. The PCA revealed that HJ was distinctive from the other 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> spp. and MKO could not be detached from MK (PC1 40.78% and PC2 20.49%). According to the bi-plot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00803-f002">Figure 2</xref>b), L-linalool was principal in the HJ while L-limonene, terpinen-4-ol, and 
 <italic>Î²</italic>-phellandrene were among the major components found in MK and MKO. By interpreting the volatile substances according to their descriptors using a heatmap, it was found that HJ was also separated from other species (
