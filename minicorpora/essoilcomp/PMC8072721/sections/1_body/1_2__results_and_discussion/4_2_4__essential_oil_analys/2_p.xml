<p>The chemical profiles of the essential oils from makhwaen fruits collected from different locations were variable. The major components of all samples could be described as following sequence: MK1; limonene (4.05 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>), sabinene (3.20 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) and L
 <sup>−</sup>phellandrene (1.47 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>), MK2; sabinene (2.55 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>), terpinen-4-ol (2.05 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) and 
 <italic>β</italic>-phellandrene (1.85 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>), MK3; limonene (6.89 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>), sabinene (3.00 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) and 
 <italic>β</italic>-ocimen (1.47 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>), HJ; sabinene (4.56 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>), terpinen-4-ol (4.31 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) and γ-terpene (1.08 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>). To this extend, geographical or environmental factors would play an important role in the chemical composition of the volatiles [
