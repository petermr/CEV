<p>This is the first report on the extraction, chemical composition and biological activity of essential oil from this species. The results of the present study demonstrated the high yield of essential oil in these species, making the copal fruit a suitable option for industrial exploitation. α-Phellandrene, limonene, α-pinene and terpinolene were the main components. The in vitro biological activities showed that essential oil exerted a moderate activity against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. The essential oil of 
 <italic>Dacryodes peruviana</italic> showed strong repellent activity against mosquitoes. The results obtained in the present investigation give a strong argument for the use of copal fruits, a resource that is renewed annually, as an alternative to the use of trees for wood.
