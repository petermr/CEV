<p>Most essential oils have relative densities of less than 1 (density of water) [
 <xref rid="B16-plants-09-01658" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and refractive indices between 1.4 and 1.6. According to Delgado Ospina et al., the refractive index in essential oils is influenced by the chemical composition of the oil, that is, the refractive index in an essential oil is an average weighting of the refractive indices of the components of the mixture [
