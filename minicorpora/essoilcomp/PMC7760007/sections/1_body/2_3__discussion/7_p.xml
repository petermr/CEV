<p>With the ABTS and DPPH methods, the antioxidant activity obtained was weak. For the essential oils, the weak antioxidant activity in the DPPH assay can be explained by the fact that terpene compounds are not capable of donating a hydrogen atom, and by the low solubility provided by them in the reaction medium of the assay, because this test utilizes methanol as a solvent [
