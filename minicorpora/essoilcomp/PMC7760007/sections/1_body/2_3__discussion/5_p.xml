<p>For natural products, there are no accepted standard criteria for defining the in vitro antimicrobial activity. However, Van Vuuren and Holl [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-09-01658" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] suggested a detailed classification scale for extracts and essential oils that are relevant to the characterization of the activity of our samples. For an essential oil, an activity ≤100 μg/mL is considered to be very strong, from 101 to 500 μg/mL the activity is strong, a moderate activity is reported when a MIC value lies between 501 to 1000 μg/mL, and activities &gt;1001 μg/mL are considered inactive. On this basis, the essential oil of fruit from copal presented a moderate activity against Gram-positive bacterium 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC 25923) with a MIC of 625 μg/mL. Considering that the panel should at least consist of a Gram-positive and a Gram-negative bacterium and a fungus, the essential oil was tested against five Gram-negative and two fungi, however, the EO of copal showed activities &gt;1000 μg/mL, 2500 (

 <italic>S. aureus</italic> of the EO from 
 <italic>D. peruviana</italic> fruit may be due to its high concentration in α-phellandrene and limonene, which have been reported as compounds with antibacterial capacity [
