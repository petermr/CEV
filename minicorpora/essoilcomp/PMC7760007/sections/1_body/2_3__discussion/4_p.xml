<p>The essential oil of 
 <italic>Dacryodes peruviana</italic> fruits is constituted by ~50% α-phellandrene (CAS 99-83-2), which is a cyclic monoterpene that is widespread in nature and has been identified as the main compound of several essential oils [

 <xref rid="B20-plants-09-01658" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. α-Phellandrene has been reported to not be genotoxic in Chinese hamster ovary cells and to promote tumor formation on the skin of mice treated with the primary carcinogen DMBA (7,12-Dimethylbenz[a]anthracene), but is not carcinogenic in its own right; this compound presents minimal risk of irritation sensitization or toxicity (acute oral toxicity in rats LD
