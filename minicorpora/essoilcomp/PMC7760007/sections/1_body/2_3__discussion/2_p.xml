<p>According to the categorization proposed by the “Science and Technology for Development” (CYTED), for plant species the yield values in essential oil of less than 5 mL/Kg are considered low, values between 5 mL/Kg and 10 mL/Kg intermediate, and values greater than 10 mL/Kg high [

 <italic>Bursera graveolens</italic> (Kunth) Triana &amp; Planch (Burseraceae) [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-09-01658" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], a yield of 3.7% has been reported in essential oil of sawdust from the trunks of trees, and a yield of 2.9% for fresh fruits, and in the species 
 <italic>Schinus molle</italic> L. (Anacardiaceae) a yield of 3.5% of the fruits was obtained [
