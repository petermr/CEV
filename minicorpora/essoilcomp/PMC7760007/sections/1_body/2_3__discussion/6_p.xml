<p>Regarding repellent activity, all concentrations tested showed strong repellent activity [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-09-01658" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The repellent activity is directly related to the chemical composition and the main compounds contained in the essential oil. Compounds similar to the main compounds found in copal EA have been reported in other essential oils with repellent activity. The essential oil of 
 <italic>Senecio pogonias</italic>, in which α-phellandrene (22%), α-pinene (48%) and p-cymene (7.1%) were reported, presented a PR of 68% (Class IV) against 
 <italic>Triatoma infestans</italic> Klug [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-09-01658" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Essential oils with limonene and α-pinene as the main compounds, such as the essential oil of 
 <italic>Tagetes minuta</italic> [

 <italic>Myrica gale</italic> [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-09-01658" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], show strong (100% and 82%, respectively) mosquito repellent activity. In addition, good repellent activity has been reported for AEs that contain high amounts of limonene such as the essential oils of 
 <italic>Citrus reticulata</italic>, 
 <italic>Citrus limon</italic> and 
 <italic>Citrus aurantium</italic> [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-09-01658" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The results obtained validate the use of 
 <italic>D. peruviana</italic> essential oil as an active principle in the elaboration of repellent formulas such as cream, spray or lotions.
