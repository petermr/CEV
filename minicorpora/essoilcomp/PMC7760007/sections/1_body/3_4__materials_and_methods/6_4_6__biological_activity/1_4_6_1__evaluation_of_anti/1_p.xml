 <xref rid="B38-plants-09-01658" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The bacterial strains were incubated in MH broth and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by the two fold serial dilution method using 96-well microtiter plates [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-09-01658" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Tetracycline was used as the positive control for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and DMSO was considered as negative control (positive growth with 5% DMSO as final concentration).
