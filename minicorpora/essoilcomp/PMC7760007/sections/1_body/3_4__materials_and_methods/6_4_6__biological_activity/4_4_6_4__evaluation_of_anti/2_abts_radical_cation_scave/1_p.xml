<p>The ABTS assay [

 <xref rid="B50-plants-09-01658" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] was used to evaluate the free radical scavenging of essential oil as described by Valarezo et al. (2020). The ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup> radical cation standard solution was prepared by reaction of ABTS and potassium persulfate; this solution was diluted in methanol until an absorbance of 1.1 ± 0.02 was obtained in a spectrophotometer UV with a wavelength of 734 nm. Quantities of 150 μL of the essential oil diluted at different concentrations (0.025 to 2.5 mg/mL) were mixed with 2850 μL of ABTS and allowed to react for 2 h at room temperature, protected from light, and immediately the absorbance was measured at 734 nm. The same amount of deionized water was used as blank control while BHT and Trolox were used as positive controls. The inhibition of ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup> radicals was determined as follows:
