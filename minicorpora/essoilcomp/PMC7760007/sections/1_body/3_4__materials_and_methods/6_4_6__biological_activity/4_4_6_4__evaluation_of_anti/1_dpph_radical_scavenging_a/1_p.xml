<p>The DPPH free radical scavenging activity of oils was measured based on the scavenging activity of the stabilized 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydryl radical, the method has been described previously by Valarezo et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-plants-09-01658" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. A solution of DPPH was prepared and the absorbance adjusted with methanol until to obtain a reading of 1.1 ± 0.02 absorbance units at a wavelength of 515 nm in an UV spectrophotometer (Genesys 10S UV-Vis Spectrophotometer, Thermo Scientific). Quantities of 150 μL of the essential oil diluted at different concentrations (0.025 to 2.5 mg/mL) were mixed with 2850 μL of DPPH and allowed to react for 24 h at room temperature, protected from light; after this, the absorbance was measured at 515 nm.
