In one of the filter paper halves, 1 mL of different concentrations of a solution of essential oil and glycerin was applied homogeneously; the concentrations of the solution were 0.5%, 1%, 2% and 3% of essential oil (

The treated filter papers were allowed to air dry until the solvent evaporated, then the two filter paper semicircles were placed contiguously in a Petri dish. Inside the Petri dish, 10 mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) were released. The count of mosquitoes present in each half was carried out every hour for five hours and a commercial repellent with active ingredient N, N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) was used as a positive control. To convert the results into a percentage of repulsion (PR), the following formula is applied: PR (%) = (Nc − 50) × 2, where Nc is the percentage of mosquitoes present in the half where the glycerin was applied (control half). Positive values (+) indicate repellency and negative values (−) indicate attraction. All tests were repeated three times and mean values were classified according to
