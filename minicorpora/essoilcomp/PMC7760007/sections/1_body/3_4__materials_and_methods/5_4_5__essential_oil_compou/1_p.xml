<p>Qualitative analysis of essential oils was carried out by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) as per the procedures described earlier by Valarezo et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-plants-09-01658" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], using an Agilent gas chromatograph (model 6890N series) coupled to a mass spectrometer (quadrupole) detector (model Agilent series 5973 inert). Identification of the constituents was carried out by comparing the retention index (RI) and mass spectral data (MS) with those of published literature [

 <xref rid="B41-plants-09-01658" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-plants-09-01658" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The RI were obtained through the arithmetic index described by van Den Dool and Dec Kratz [
 <xref rid="B43-plants-09-01658" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] using the Equation (1). Quantitative analyses were performed using an Agilent gas chromatograph (model 6890N series) equipped with a flame ionization detector (GC/FID) according to the procedure described by Valarezo, Tandazo, Galán, Rosales and Benítez [
 <xref rid="B39-plants-09-01658" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The relative amounts of individual components were calculated based on the GC peak area (FID response) without using a correction factor. In both cases, for GC/MS and GC/FID, a J&amp;W DB-5ms Ultra Inert GC column (30 m, 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm) and an automatic injector (series 7683) were used. The GC column was maintained at 50 °C for the first 3 min, followed by gradient of 3 °C/min until 230 °C, which was held for 3 min (run time 66 min).
