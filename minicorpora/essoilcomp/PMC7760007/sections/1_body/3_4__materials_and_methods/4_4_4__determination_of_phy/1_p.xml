<p>With the aims of knowing the physical nature of essential oil, some of its physical properties were determined. The density of essential oils was determined according to the standard AFNOR NF T 75–111 using a pycnometer (1 mL) and an analytical balance (model Mettler AC 100 ± 0.0001). Refraction index was determined according to the standard AFNOR NF T 75–112 using a refractometer (model ABBE). The optical rotation was determined according to the standard method ISO 592:1998 using an automatic polarimeter model Mrc-P810. The measurements were performed at 20 °C.</p>
