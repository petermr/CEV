<p>From fresh fruits, with 74 ± 3% of moisture, approximately 480 mL of essential oil (AE) from 10,000 g of vegetal material were obtained, which represented a yield of 4.8 ± 0.2% (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01658-f001">Figure 1</xref> shows the essential oil extraction rate (accumulated volume vs. time); the amount of essential oil extracted per hour decreases over time from 42 mL/Kg in the first hour to 0.2 mL/Kg in the last hour. In both cases (fresh and dried fruits), 90% of essential oil is obtained in 0.75 h and 95% in 1 h.
