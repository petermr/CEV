<p>The identification of volatile compounds present in 
 <italic>Dacryodes peruviana</italic> of Ecuador was carried out by GC/MS and GC/FID. The qualitative and quantitative data of the chemical composition of the oils of this species are shown in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01658-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. In essential oil, twenty-five chemical constituents were identified, representing 99.1% of the total composition. These constituents were mainly grouped into aliphatic monoterpene hydrocarbons (ALM, 94.40%); furthermore, a low amount of oxygenated monoterpenes (OXM, 1.17%) were identified and the presence of oxygenated sesquiterpene (OXS) was not determined. The principal constituents are found to be ALM (CF: C10H16, MM: 136.13 Da) α-phellandrene (50.32 ± 3.32%), limonene (23.03 ± 2.53%), α-pinene (8.27 ± 1.28%) and terpinolene (5.23 ± 0.93%). In addition, 3.06 ± 0.80% of the ARM ρ-cymene was determined.
