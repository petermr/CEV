<p>Essential oils obtained from fruit of 
 <italic>D. peruviana</italic> were assessed against five Gram-negative and two Gram-positive bacteria; the MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration, μg/mL) values are shown in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01658-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The maximum concentration tested was 5000 μg/mL; the bacterium 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> did not provide MIC at this concentration (MIC &gt; 5000 μg/mL), and the microorganism that presented the lowest MIC was the Gram-positive bacterium
