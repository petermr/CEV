<p>Through the ABTS method, the essential oils showed a 27% of inhibition to 1000 ppm; a low amount of antioxidant activity. However, with the concentration ranges tested in the ABTS method, essential oil did not provide IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 1000 μg/mL). Among the standards tested, Trolox with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 460 μg/mL was the most efficient positive control. Employing the DPPH technique, a 22% of inhibition with 1000 ppm was obtained, however the essential oil did not provide IC
 <sub>50</sub> values in the concentration ranges tested (
