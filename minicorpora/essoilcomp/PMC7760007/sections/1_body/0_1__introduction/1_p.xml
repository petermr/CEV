<p>Burseraceae is a family of flowering plants belonging to order Sapindales, composed of about 18 genera, which includes over 649 currently accepted species of resinous trees and shrubs (The Plant List, 2013). Burseraceae are native primarily to tropical America with few species in Africa and Asia (Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2020). These species produce gum resins and essential oils, which are responsible of many medicinal properties (El-Shemy, 2018). From the literature, essential oils are recognized as a rich source of bioactive compounds, which present biological activities such as antifungal, antibacterial, anti-insecticidal, antiviral and antitumor; the identification of these activities has increased the interest in looking for biological properties of essential oils.</p>
