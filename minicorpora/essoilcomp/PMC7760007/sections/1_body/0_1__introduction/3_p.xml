<p>Currently, Ecuador occupies the sixth position worldwide in the number of plant species per unit surface area, which makes this country a biodiversity hotspot [
 <xref rid="B4-plants-09-01658" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, there are few studies of its aromatic plant species, especially of the aromatic species of the Burseraceae family; for this reason, the aims of this research are (i) to contribute to the knowledge of the aromatic species of the Burseraceae family, isolating and studying the essential oil of the species 
 <italic>Dacryodes peruviana</italic> from Ecuador, (ii) to promote the use of essential oils by providing information on their availability, chemical composition and biological properties, and (iii) to provide an alternative for the use of non-timber resources, by using the fruits as a replacement for wood and leaves. In addition, as we know, this is the first report of the extraction of essential oil of this species and the study of its physical properties, chemical composition and biological activity.
