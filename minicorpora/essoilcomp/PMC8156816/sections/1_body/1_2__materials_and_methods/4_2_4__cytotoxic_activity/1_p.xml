<p>The effect of each essential oil on the global growth of the cell line was investigated through a colorimetric MTT assay [
 <xref rid="B17-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] as previously described [
 <xref rid="B18-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Briefly, human keratinocytes cells (HaCaT) were grown in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.5% penicillin-streptomycin and seeded at a density of 10 000 cells/mL in 96-well plates. After 24h of incubation at 37 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> humidified atmosphere, the cells were treated with three concentrations of the essential oils (31.3, 62.5, and 125 μg/mL). The contact time of incubation was 72 h. Finally, after 3 to 5 hours of incubation with the MTT (0.5 mg/mL), the plates were centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant was discarded, and the formazan crystals formed dissolved in DMSO. A spectrophotometer (680XR, BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) was used to measure the absorbance (at 570 and 630 nm), which can be directly correlated to the number of viable cells (cell viability (% RC) = (absorbance of treated cells/absorbance of control) × 100).
