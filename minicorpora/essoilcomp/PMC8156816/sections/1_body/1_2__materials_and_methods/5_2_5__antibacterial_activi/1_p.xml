<p>Two types of antibacterial assays were employed as previously described [
 <xref rid="B18-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. All the samples, essential oils, mixtures of essential oil types, and individual compounds were evaluated alone (direct activity) or in association with an antibiotic (indirect activity) at a sub-MIC concentration (non-active concentration). The tested strains were the Gram-positive 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> LMG 15,975 (methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, abbreviated as MRSA) and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> LMG 21,674 (fusidic-acid-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, abbreviated as FUSR). The chosen antibiotics were penicillin V and fusidic acid. The broth microdilution method in 96-well plates was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). For the direct activity, samples were serially diluted to achieve a concentration ranging from 1 mg/mL to 2 μg/mL. For the indirect activity, the antibiotic was first serially diluted (from 64 to 7.103 μg/mL) and the samples were subsequently added to the wells at the defined sub-MIC concentration. These ranges were chosen because above them the sample is considered as non-active. For both assays, the inoculum was prepared from a suspension of 24-hour colonies to obtain a turbidity of 0.5 McFarland and added to the wells to achieve a final concentration of 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> CFU/mL. Plates were then incubated at 37 °C overnight and MTT (0.8 mg/mL) was used to determine the MIC by naked eye. A growth (Mueller–Hinton broth medium with inoculum) and a non-growth (only MHB) control were carried out. In addition, antibiotics were also always tested alone as positive controls.
