<p>With the progress of science in the modern world and especially since the discovery of penicillin in 1928 by Fleming [
 <xref rid="B1-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], it seemed that the use of natural products was no longer an essential need. However, as a result of the antibiotic resistance crisis and the general population seeking natural treatments, research on natural products and notoriously on essential oils is back on the rise [
 <xref rid="B2-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Essential oils are generally composed of hundreds of secondary metabolites that confer a multitude of biological activities [
 <xref rid="B3-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Despite the antibacterial potential of essential oils and the amount of literature describing their biological properties, clinical studies are scarce with most being related to mouthwashes, and actual use of essential oils by healthcare professionals still seems a distant goal [
 <xref rid="B7-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This could be due to the fact that their clinical safety is sometimes questionable [
 <xref rid="B8-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and/or they possess a chemical composition that can easily vary. Indeed, their chemical composition depends on both biotic or abiotic factors and a batch can be chemically different over the course of a year even if it comes from the same harvested place and the same producer [
 <xref rid="B6-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The aim of this study was to find a way to standardize the chemical composition of essential oils by preparing a homemade mixture composed of the most abundant compounds since only two or three major compounds are often accountable for the antibacterial activities [
 <xref rid="B10-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Ajowan (
 <italic>Trachyspermum ammi</italic> L.) and thyme chemotype thymol (
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> L.) essential oils were chosen due to their close chemical composition, both having thymol as a major compound, a monoterpenoid phenol known to possess antibacterial properties [

 <xref rid="B12-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The use of thymol as an additive to polymers in wound skin infection treatment has been recently investigated [
 <xref rid="B13-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This point is interesting since the aim in this paper was to investigate the homemade mixtures against the Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, which is considered as a high threat to human health by the World Health Organization [
 <xref rid="B15-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and often present in skin infections [
