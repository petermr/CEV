<p>The chemical composition of essential oils is very complex and varied, depending on many factors, both internal and external, to the plant. From our point of view, this high variability could complicate their possible clinical development as effective antibacterial agents. The eight thyme chemotype thymol essential oils purchased on the market all presented a stable chemical composition due to the European pharmacopeia standards or the close geographic origin. By contrast, the chemical composition of ajowan essential oil, which does not have a defined chemotype and is not described in the European pharmacopeia, can be quite varied. In our attempt to standardize the chemical composition by making homemade essential oil mixtures using their major compounds, it appears that in the case of ajowan and thyme essential oils the use of thymol alone as a major compound would be of most benefit. The other two major compounds found in these oils, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene and 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene, do not act in synergy with the thymol. Surprisingly, when testing some minor compounds, it was observed that 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene would be a very good candidate as an antibacterial agent against infections caused by 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. More studies on the mechanisms of this compound and on its in vivo activities would nevertheless be necessary to further its possible therapeutic development.
