<p>The indirect antibacterial activity of the samples in association with fusidic acid are not presented in 
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00584-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> since an improved indirect antibacterial activity with this antibiotic could not be detected. Fusidic acid is principally active against Staphylococci, but the emergence of resistant strains is increasing [
 <xref rid="B20-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The breakpoint to consider a Staphylococci resistance is 1 mg/L [
 <xref rid="B28-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In this study, a specific 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> resistant to fusidic acid (FUSR) with a tested MIC at 256 Î¼g/mL (
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> LMG 21674) was used. However, no indirect activity was observed, and the MIC of the tested association remained at the same MIC as the one of the antibiotic alone. To our knowledge, there is no literature about the positive association of fusidic acid with an essential oil against a resistant strain of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>.
