<p>Regarding antibacterial activity, no enhancement of the activity was observed for the thymol/carvacrol mixture (M8), for both direct and indirect activities, against any of the strains. In fact, the activity of the compounds alone was equivalent or better. Similar results and even some antagonisms were found by Rúa et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] when testing the carvacrol/thymol combination against different strains of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. The same observation as for M8 was made for the direct activity of M9, M10, and M11 against FUSR 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, where the MIC was similar to the one observed for 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene alone. Therefore, it seems just as beneficial to use the compound alone since the cytotoxicity is the same. However, against the strain MRSA, the results of mixtures M9, M10, and M11 were quite interesting. It seems that 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene, which did not present a direct activity (&gt;1000 μg/mL), enhances the activity of either thymol or carvacrol when mixed together in equal parts (M9 and M10, respectively) and when it is mixed with thymol and carvacrol in equal proportions (M11). Those MIC values of 125 μg/mL were the best ones observed against the strain 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> LMG 15975.
