<p>The aim of this study was to obtain an efficient antibacterial “homemade mixture-type essential oil” composed of only major compounds of ajowan and thyme chemotype thymol essential oils. The mixture-type ajowan (M1) with 50% thymol, 25% 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene, 20% 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, and 5% 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene presented the same level of activity as ajowan essential oils. Similar statements can be made for the mixture type thyme chemotype thymol (M2) with 50% thymol, 20% 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, 10% 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene, 5% 
 <italic>β</italic>-myrcene, 5% linalool, 5% 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene, and 5% carvacrol. As for the mixtures M3 to M7, where thymol was increased and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene/
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene decreased, it was observed that these last two compounds did not enhance thymol activity. As the thymol was increased and the two others were decreased, only the full activity of the thymol, as if it were present alone, was measured. As the cytotoxicity of thymol was similar (less than 62.5 μg/mL) to ajowan and thyme chemotype thymol essential oils and the prepared mixtures, there was, in those cases, no interest in using them over thymol alone. However, the advantage of the prepared mixtures over the ajowan essential oils was that their composition was controlled and consequently their antibacterial activity would not depend on the batch.
