The major compounds of thyme chemotype thymol essential oil are well defined by ranges in the European pharmacopeia, and regarding the ones bought in the market for this study, their chemical composition did not fluctuate between the suppliers (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00584-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The percentage means obtained for their major compounds via GC–MS analysis showed that they were approximatively in the ranges indicated by the European pharmacopeia (between parentheses in the text): with 57% (37–55%) for thymol, 26% (14–28%) for 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, and 8% (4–12%) for
