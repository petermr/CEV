<p>Essential oils are known to possess antibacterial properties, especially against Gram-positive bacteria, such as 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, a skin infection pathogen [

 <xref rid="B15-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Since essential oils can have variable chemical compositions [
 <xref rid="B19-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and their antibacterial activity generally comes from their major compounds [
 <xref rid="B10-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], homemade mixtures of ajowan and thyme (chemotype thymol) essential oils containing only the major compounds were prepared. Eight ajowan essential oils and eight thyme chemotype thymol essential oils were bought on the market and their chemical compositions were analyzed via GC–MS. The antibacterial activities of the commercial essential oils, homemade mixtures, and a selection of chemical compounds were investigated individually (direct activity) or in combination (indirect activity) against two 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>-resistant strains. For the indirect activity, the investigated products were combined at a sub-MIC concentration with penicillin V and fusidic acid. Those 
 <italic>β</italic>-lactam and steroidal antibiotics are commonly used to treat either systemic or topical MRSA infections, respectively, although MRSA are usually more resistant to both of them [
