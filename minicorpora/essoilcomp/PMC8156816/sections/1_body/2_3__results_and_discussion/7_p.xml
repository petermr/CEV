<p>After 72 hours of contact, all the samples presented a cytotoxicity on the HaCaT cells at 125 μg/mL (mean residual viability under 80%), but only the linalool was toxic at all tested concentrations, even at the smallest (31.3 μg/mL). According to the interpretation proposed by Döll-Boscardin et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], linalool is the only compound with strong cytotoxic activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &lt; 31.3 μg/mL), all the others presented moderate (31.3 μg/mL &lt; IC
 <sub>50</sub> &lt; 125 μg/mL) to weak (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 125 μg/mL) cytotoxic activity. Accordingly, to avoid a potential cytotoxicity, the sub-MIC concentrations selected for the indirect antibacterial activity were under the observed cytotoxic threshold for each sample.
