<p>The indirect activity of 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene is more impressive than its direct activity. Against the FUSR 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, the concentration of penicillin V was decreased by 267-fold (16 to 0.06 μg/mL) when associated with 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene at a sub-MIC of 15 μg/mL, a concentration under the observed toxicity threshold on HaCaT. Even if it is less impressive, this compound, at a non-cytotoxic sub-MIC, also decreased by 4-fold the concentration of penicillin V on the MRSA. Carvacrol and thymol, at a sub-MIC of 32 μg/mL, also presented good indirect activity with a 4-fold decreased MIC on FUSR 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and a 4-fold to 8-fold decrease on MRSA, respectively. Carvacrol and thymol are known to be synergistic with different antibiotics against different pathogens, including penicillin on 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> [
