<p>To answer this question, the biological activities of the major compounds and some minor compounds present in the ajowan and thyme chemotype thymol essential oils were first tested. Apart from thymol, two compounds showed a direct activity. Carvacrol presented an MIC of 250 μg/mL against the strain MRSA and an MIC of 62.5 μg/mL against the FUSR 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain. Still on the FUSR 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene showed an MIC of 31.3 μg/mL. The MIC observed for carvacrol and 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene are quite interesting since they are active at concentrations identified as non-cytotoxic in the tested cell line, HaCaT. Carvacrol is known to possess antibacterial properties against a large variety of strains [

 <xref rid="B40-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. On the contrary, 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene is rarely referenced in the literature for its antibacterial activity. This sesquiterpene has been classified as safe to be used as a flavor ingredient in fragrances and in cosmetics by many authorities [
 <xref rid="B41-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Some studies have demonstrated it has different biological properties, such as antifungal [

 <xref rid="B43-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], antileishmanial [
 <xref rid="B44-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and antitrypanosomal properties [

 <xref rid="B46-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Lately, studies have been focusing on other qualities, such as its anti-inflammatory [
 <xref rid="B47-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], antidiabetic [
 <xref rid="B48-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and anticancer and chemopreventive properties [
 <xref rid="B41-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Nevertheless, fewer studies refer to the antibacterial properties of 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene. Dahham et al. (2015) found a better MIC on 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> MTCC 7405 than the kanamycin. No indication about the resistance of the strain MTCC 7405 was found. As part of his study on balsam fir, Pichette et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] found an MIC of 5.1 μg/mL against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 25923. The difference with the MIC found in this study (31.3 μg/mL) is not surprising since the strain ATCC 25,923 is an MSSA. By contrast, DeCarlo et al. [
 <xref rid="B50-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] found an MIC of 313 μg/mL against an MSSA (ATCC 29,213). As mentioned above, even if the same microdilution method was used different strains and adaptations made to the protocol can lead to different results.
