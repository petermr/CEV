<p>The indirect activities of these three mixtures in association with penicillin V are also enhanced compared to the indirect activities of the compounds alone. However, the activity of 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene alone against FUSR 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (0.06 μg/mL) was still the best observed. Even if the activity of carvacrol and thymol were quite enhanced, from 4 μg/mL to 0.5 μg/mL and 0.125 μg/mL, respectively, it would be best to use 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene alone in this particular case with penicillin V and against the strain 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> LMG 21674. On the contrary, against the strain MRSA, it seems best to use the mixtures. Thymol and 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene both induced a 4-fold decrease of the concentration of penicillin V. Together (M9), the MIC reached an 8-fold decrease (4 to 0.5 μg/mL). The best indirect activity against the strain MRSA was observed with the mixture M11 (33.3% of each compound), which, in association with penicillin V, decreased the concentration of the antibiotic by 16-fold (4 to 0.25 μg/mL).
