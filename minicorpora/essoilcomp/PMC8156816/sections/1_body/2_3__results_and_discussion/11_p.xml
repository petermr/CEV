<p>The indirect activity presented in this study made use of a different method to test synergistic effects between two compounds. The difference with the traditional checkerboard method was that compound A (antibiotic) was serially diluted and compound B (essential oil/pure metabolite or homemade mixture) was added at a fix sub-MIC concentration, determined under the cytotoxic activity threshold. This method allowed us to observe directly the increased activity of the antibiotic by the diminution of its MIC. An indirect activity is observed when the MIC of the association is lower than the MIC of the antibiotic alone. Concerning the commercial essential oils, the conclusions drawn from the indirect activity were quite similar to the ones from direct activity. No indirect activity was presented by 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene and 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene on both strains. However, thymol decreased four-fold the MIC of penicillin V on FUSR 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (16 to 4 μg/mL) and on MRSA (4 to 1 μg/mL). The indirect activity of thymol was two-fold higher than the one of some essential oils, which can be explained by its concentration, present around 50% in the essential oils. But for some purchased essential oils there was no activity observed with the penicillin V. The hypothesis is that some antagonisms happened or that it was the effect of the variable chemical composition. This observation led us to the central point of the study: could isolated active compounds or a blend of the most active molecules of essential oils generate better antibacterial activities than genuine commercial products?
