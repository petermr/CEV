<p>Given the interesting properties of thymol, carvacrol, and 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene, other mixtures (M8 to M11) where tested with different concentrations. 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene was a little bit more cytotoxic against the HaCaT cell line than the two other compounds. Therefore, the mixtures containing 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene (M9, M10, and M11) presented a cytotoxicity above 31.3 μg/mL while M8, containing 50% thymol and 50% carvacrol, presented a cytotoxicity above 62.5 μg/mL. The cytotoxic level of compounds can vary between cell lines, but it is very important to always verify that the antibacterial activity is not related to a high level of toxicity. Very few papers checked the cytotoxic activity on normal cell lines as a control. Most of the publications regarding the cytotoxic effects of essential oils or their compounds were focused on their anticancer activity. Among those that tested healthy cells, thymol and carvacrol presented low cytotoxicity on human lung cells [

 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene showed a low cytotoxic effect on green monkey kidney, mouse fibroblast, human retinal ganglion, and human colon fibroblast cell lines [

 <xref rid="B45-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. These results are in line with the ones described in this study where the IC
 <sub>50</sub> was located between 32 and 125 μg/mL, which represents a moderate to weak cytotoxicity. The advantage to using controlled homemade mixtures or compounds alone is that negative effects, as cytotoxicity, can be more standardly regulated. The balance of benefit and risk can be more stable compared to essential oils whose composition can vary considerably.
