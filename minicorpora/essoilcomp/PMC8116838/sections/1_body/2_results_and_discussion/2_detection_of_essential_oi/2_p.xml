<p>MALDI‐MS analysis of sample sections detected protonated glycine‐modified PA (Gly‐PA), β‐caryophyllene (βC) and rosmarinic acid (RA) ions at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 208.1, 205.3 and 360.1, respectively, in positive ion mode. Gly‐PA contains a Schiff base between glycine and PA and showed an increased mass signal (
 <italic>m/z</italic> 208.1 as protonated signal) (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32232-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). We confirmed PA modification by glycine by tandem MS using the above‐detected ion as the precursor ion from the standard and from perilla sections (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32232-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2b, c</xref>). The Gly‐PA precursor ion was cleaved and provided ions corresponding to the glycine hydroxy group and carboxy group, and the lactone ring of PA. As expected from their chemical structures, fragment ions were observed at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 190.1, 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 166.1 and 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 162.1 from both the standard sample and from perilla sections, suggesting that the peaks of the precursor ion from perilla sections detected by MALDI‐MSI matched the structures of the target analytes.
