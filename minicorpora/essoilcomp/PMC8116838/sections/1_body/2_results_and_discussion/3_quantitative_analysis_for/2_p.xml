<p>PA and βC standards were separated using the same gradient conditions by GC‐MS (Nexis, GC‐2030, Shimadzu). We selected two different ions that corresponded to PA and βC (
 <italic>m/z</italic> 67.0 and 93.0). The PA, βC, and RA contents (mg/g sample) were calculated from the peak areas in the chromatograms and by using calibration curves. The concentrations of PA and βC in perilla paste were 12.6 ± 0.62 and 0.27 ± 0.02 [mg/g] sample and in fresh perilla were 0.20 ± 0.07 and 0.03 ± 0.006 [mg/g] sample, respectively. The concentrations of PA and βC in the paste sample were 63 and 9 times that in the fresh sample, showing that essential oils are mostly stored in oil glands. We therefore pressed a peeled perilla herb section to image essential oils. For RA, we used UPLC‐MS since RA is not a VOC. The concentration of RA was 0.16 ± 0.02 [mg/g] sample (Table
