<p>Glycine (Gly) was used to derivatize PA after crushing the oil glands in a perilla section using pressure. Thus, PA was imaged by selecting 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 208.1 as the protonated Gly‐PA ion. The image of protonated Gly‐PA was blurred around the crushed oil glands but PA was nonetheless clearly localized at oil glands. A small amount of Gly‐PA was observed in the epidermis region (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32232-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3c, d</xref>), suggesting that PA is produced in plant cells and stored in oil glands. Organic compounds with a boiling point (BP) below 523[K] are defined as VOCs. Thus, PA (BP: 497 [K]) without glycine modification did not image due to volatilization during measurement whereas Gly‐PA could be imaged. Using chemical information software (ChemDraw Prime 19, Hulinks, Tokyo, Japan), the theoretical boiling point of Gly‐PA was estimated to be 716 [K] and thus Gly‐PA did not volatilize during measurement. The 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 205.3 ion, corresponding to protonated βC, localized at the same region as Gly‐PA, indicating that βC is also contained in oil glands (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32232-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3e, f</xref>). βC was not derivatized with Gly as it contains no reactive group. The BP of βC (576 [K]) is slightly above that of the VOC threshold (523 [K]). MS measurements were conducted rapidly using the rapifleX MALDI‐TOF‐MS instrument and a 10 [KHz] pulse laser. The measurement area was about 4 [mm
 <sup>2</sup>] and the laser spot areas (200 shots) were detected with a spot‐to‐spot center distance of 20 µm in each direction on the section. The measurement time was estimated using Equation (
