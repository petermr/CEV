<p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to simultaneously visualize several major metabolites in 
 <italic>Perilla frutescens</italic> tissues. Our imaging results for PA, βC, and RA suggest that these metabolites are stored in oil glands. The aldehyde group in PA reacts with the amino group of Gly to form a Schiff base that prevents volatilization. This approach can aid the investigation of VOCs and demonstrates the utility of derivatization in MS measurements. We determined the distribution of these metabolites in 
 <italic>Perilla frutescens</italic> sections by peeling 
 <italic>Perilla frutescens</italic> surfaces using a cyanoacrylate adhesion compound. The peeled sample surface preserves the morphology and transferred oil glands. Although quantification by MALDI‐MSI is difficult because the signal intensity depends on many factors (e.g., ionization efficiency, extraction efficiency from the tissue, and sample preparation), mass spectrometry imaging is a powerful tool for the direct visualization of fruit compounds and biomolecules in biological tissues (Taira,
