<p>The rapid measurement time and borderline VOC BP allowed the imaging of βC in 
 <italic>Perilla frutescens</italic> sections. The estimated BP of RA is below that of VOCs. Protonated RA ion (
 <italic>m/z</italic> 360.1) was observed throughout the epidermis region, including the oil glands (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32232-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3g, h</xref>). RA has antibacterial, antifungal, and antioxidant properties and is produced and accumulates in cells as RA‐glycoside (Trócsányi et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32232-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Plants use RA as an antioxidant. Thus, RA‐glycoside may degrade to RA in the cytoplasm and be transported to oil glands to protect secondary metabolites such as PA and βC. We speculate that oil glands preferentially accumulate metabolites with lower BPs, such as VOCs. PA has a highly reactive aldehyde group. To prevent unnecessary reaction between metabolites, plants may accumulate select molecules in oil glands.
