<p>Perilla herb (
 <italic>Perilla frutescens var. crispa</italic>) is an annual plant that grows wild and is cultivated for food in many regions in Asia. Aromatic herbs such as perilla contain essential oils such as monoterpenoid perillaldehyde (PA) and bicyclic sesquiterpenes β‐caryophyllene (βC) and have distinctive fragrances. PA and βC also exhibit antibacterial and local anesthetic activity. Perilla herb is thus used as a herbal medicine component (Legault &amp; Pichette, 
 <xref rid="fsn32232-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>) and may be an antidote for food poisoning. Rosmarinic acid (RA), a common component in perilla herb, has anti‐inflammatory and antioxidant activity, enhances the concentration of monoamine in the brain, and inhibits amyloid‐β aggregation (Hase, 
 <xref rid="fsn32232-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). These essential oils act as secondary metabolites in extracellular oil glands in perilla (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32232-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The oils are produced in inner plant cells and are transported to and stored in the oil glands. Conventional staining methods using Sudan red show the presence of essential oils in oil glands but provides only indirect information as it does not selectively stain essential oils. The construction of antibodies for small molecules is difficult, which limits immunostaining methods for spatial visualization. Gas chromatography (GC)‐MS analysis provides quantitative information and is suitable for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as aromatic compounds but provides no visual spatial information. Therefore, information on the localization of these essential oils is lacking and thus the development of selective visualization methods is required not only for fundamental plant science (Shiono &amp; Taira, 
 <xref rid="fsn32232-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) but also in fields such as food science (Cho et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32232-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Enomoto et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32232-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) and omics science (Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32232-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI), and typically matrix‐assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI‐MS), enables the direct mapping and imaging of biomolecules present in tissue sections (Stoeckli et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32232-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). Tissue cross‐sections are mounted on an electrically conductive glass slide, sprayed with an organic matrix, and irradiated with laser shots. Each spot irradiated by the laser becomes a pixel in the final image. Target‐specific markers such as antibodies are not required, and MSI enables the simultaneous detection of multiple analytes in a single section of animal tissue (Fujii, 
 <xref rid="fsn32232-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Hase, 
 <xref rid="fsn32232-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>; Tatsuta, 
 <xref rid="fsn32232-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) or plant tissue (Shikano, 
 <xref rid="fsn32232-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Shiono, 
 <xref rid="fsn32232-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Taira et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32232-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). We solved the difficulty of making sections of thin samples such as leaves by applying cyanoacrylate adhesive to the leaf surface, then peeling the adhesive off the leaf surface with indium tin oxide (ITO) glass (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32232-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In the present study, focusing on essential oils, we imaged three target compounds (PA (boiling point (BP): 497 [K]), βC (BP: 576 [K]), and RA (BP: 1,194 [K])). Generally, organic compounds with a boiling point below 523[K] are defined as a VOC. Imaging VOCs under vacuum is problematic due to their volatility, and thus, we developed a method of amino acid derivatization by nucleophilic addition reaction of amino group of glycine. The aldehyde group of PA reacts with the primary amine of glycine, increasing its BP value above that of a VOC. We compared the localizations and concentrations of these three essential oils in fresh perilla and perilla paste by MALDI‐MSI and GC‐ and liquid chromatography (LC)‐MS.
