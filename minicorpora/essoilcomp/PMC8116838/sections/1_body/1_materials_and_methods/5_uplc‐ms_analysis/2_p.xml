<p>The rosmarinic acid (RA) content in the 
 <italic>Perilla frutescens</italic> sample was determined by UPLC‐MS analysis (ACQUITY UPLC H‐class (Waters, London, UK)) and ESI‐TOF (impact II, Bruker Daltonics)) using an ODS column (BEH C18, 2.1 × 100 mm, 1.7 µm) with the column temperature set at 40°C. Two mobile phases were used for gradient elution: Solvent A, water/formic acid (0.03%); Solvent B, methanol/formic acid (0.03%). Liquid chromatography was carried out at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min with a linear gradient under the following conditions: 0–2.5 min, solvent A 70%–20%; 2.5–5.0 min, solvent A 0%. RA positive ion was detected using an electrospray ionization mass instrument (impactII, Bruker Daltonics) (end plate offset at 500 V, capillary voltage at 4.5 KV). The RA calibration curve was prepared using an RA standard (5, 25, 50 µg/ml).
