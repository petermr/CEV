<p>For MSI, the laser spot areas were detected by scanning the sections. The laser spot areas (200 shots) were detected with a spot‐to‐spot center distance of 20 µm in each direction of the 
 <italic>Perilla frutescens</italic> sample. Signals between 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 60–500 were corrected. The peeled tissue surface was irradiated with YAG laser shots in the positive or negative ion detection mode. The laser power was optimized to minimize in‐source decay of the targets. The obtained MS spectra were reconstructed to MS images with a mass bin width of 
 <italic>m/z</italic> ± 0.05 and the pseudo color scale from the mass value using FlexImaging 4.0 software (Bruker Daltonics).
