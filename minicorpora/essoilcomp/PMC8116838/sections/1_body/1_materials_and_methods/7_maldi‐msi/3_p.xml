<p>Ionization and imaging of the essential oils were confirmed with a MALDI‐TOF‐MS (rapifleX, Bruker Daltonics). Tandem MS spectra of the sections were obtained using a collision‐induced dissociation method. Precursor ion (obtained using 1000× shots) and fragment ion (obtained using 4000× shots) signals were integrated using flexControl 3.4 (Bruker Daltonics). Spectra were recorded in positive linear tandem MS mode (ion source 1 voltage, 20 kV; lens voltage, 18 kV). The collision energy was about 1.3 eV, estimated using MALDI‐TOF/TOF (PSD) mode and CID under Ar (manufacturer default settings).</p>
