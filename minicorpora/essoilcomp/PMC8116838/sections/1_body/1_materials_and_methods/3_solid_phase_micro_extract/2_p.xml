<p>An SPME fiber (length 10 mm) coated with 50/30 mm divinylbenzene/carbon WR/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS) phase (Restek) was used to extract volatile compounds. The fibers were conditioned before use and thermally cleaned between analyses by inserting the fibers into the injector port of a gas chromatography system set at 270°C for 30 min in a stream of helium.</p>
