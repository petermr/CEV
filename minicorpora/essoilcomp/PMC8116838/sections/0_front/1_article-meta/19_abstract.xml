 <p>The localization of essential oils, including flavor components, in perilla herb (
  <italic>Perilla frutescens var. crispa</italic>) were visually determined using matrix‐assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS) imaging. The surface of a perilla leaf was peeled using a cyanoacrylate adhesion compound and contained oil glands that retained their morphology and chemical properties. We imaged the three essential oils perillaldehyde, β‐caryophyllene, and rosmarinic acid (RA). Perillaldehyde was derivatized using glycine to prevent evaporation and allow its detection and imaging while localized in oil glands. β‐caryophyllene also localized in the oil glands and not in the epidermis region. RA was detected throughout the leaf, including the oil glands. Quantitative data for the three essential oils were obtained by gas chromatography‐ or liquid chromatography‐MS. The concentrations of perillaldehyde, β‐caryophyllene, and RA were 12.6 ± 0.62, 0.27 ± 0.02, and 0.16 ± 0.02 [mg/g] in the paste sample of perilla herb. Peeling using a cyanoacrylate adhesion compound, and derivatization of a target such as an aroma component have great potential for mass spectrometry imaging for multiple essential oils.
