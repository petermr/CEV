    "<h4>Context</h4>Processing with vinegar could enhance the efficacy and reduce the toxicity of <i>Curcuma phaeocaulis</i> Valeton. (Zingiberaceae), a Chinese herbal medicine with anti-inflammatory and antitumor activities.<h4>Objective</h4>This study investigated the vinegar processing effects by evaluating anti-angiogenic effect and toxicity of <i>C. phaeocaulis</i> through zebrafish and rat models.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Zebrafish embryos (AB and FLk-GFP strain) were applied to evaluate toxicity, cardiotoxicity and anti-angiogenic activity of volatile oil, and water decoction of the raw and vinegar-processed <i>C</i>. <i>phaeocaulis.</i> Meanwhile, a blood stasis syndrome rat model was applied to study the toxicity by measuring the ovarian and uterine coefficient.<h4>Results</h4><i>Curcuma phaeocaulis</i> volatile oil and its vinegar-processed products in zebrafish had an LC<sub>50</sub> of 67.315 and 95.755 μg/mL, respectively. <i>Curcuma phaeocaulis</i> water decoction and its vinegar-processed products had an LC<sub>50</sub> of 161.440 and 206.239 μg/mL, respectively. The toxicity of vinegar-processed products was significantly lower than the raw, and the development characteristic of zebrafish embryos at different times confirmed these results. The volatile oil of vinegar-processed products could inhibit the growth of intersegmental blood vessels at the dose of 20 μg/mL, while the raw materials did not exhibit such effect at the same concentration. The rat experiment also confirmed that the volatile oil could reduce toxicity of ovarian and uterine.<h4>Discussion and conclusions</h4>The study indicated that processing using vinegar could decrease toxicity and increase anti-angiogenic activity of <i>C. phaeocaulis</i>, which could be applied for clinical treatment. Further in-depth study on the synergism and detoxification mechanism of vinegar processing technology is needed."
