<p>This study showed that the vinegar-processed products induced lower toxicity than raw 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic> in a zebrafish model and rat model with blood stasis syndrome based on various physiological indices. Meanwhile, the volatile oil extracted from vinegar-processed products could inhibit the growth of intersegmental blood vessels, while the raw materials did not show such effects at the same concentration. Our findings confirmed the effects of 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic> with reducing toxicity and preventing blood stasis after vinegar processed. Moreover, it laid a foundation for further animal experiments with larger sample size, as well as for in-depth study on the mechanism of synergism and detoxification.
