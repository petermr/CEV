<p>To study the LC
 <sub>50</sub> values of lethal toxicity research, zebrafish embryos (AB strain, 12-hpf) were randomly placed in a 24-well plate, with six embryos in each well, and each dose treatment consisted of two replicates. 
 <italic>Curcuma phaeocaulis</italic>, its volatile oil, and water decoction were used as treatments using various dosages (25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 µg/mL) for 12 h. A blank control group and a solvent control group (containing 0.5% DMSO) were also employed. The original culture medium was drawn, and 750 µL of the working solution were added to each well and kept in a constant-temperature incubator until hatching. The mortality rate of each dose was recorded, and LC
 <sub>50</sub> values were determined using a LEICA M165FC stereo microscope after 12 h. The embryos were monitored once every 12 h by placing the embryos under the slides (with a glass tank) and were fixed with 4% methyl cellulose. Photomicrographs of the embryos were collected using a Zeiss Inversed Fluorescent Microscope-Observer A1.
