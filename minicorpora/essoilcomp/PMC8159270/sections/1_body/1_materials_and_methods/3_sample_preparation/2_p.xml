The samples were soaked for 30 min and decocted for 0.5 h twice. The extracted solutions were pooled together and the final volume was adjusted to 100 mL. The liquid was heated to 37 °C before administration. Volatile oil was obtained by the following methods: the samples of 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic> and its vinegar-processed products (100 g each) and water (8 times content volume) were added, soaked for 1 h, and steam-distilled for 2–3 h. The volatile oil was dissolved in DMSO.
