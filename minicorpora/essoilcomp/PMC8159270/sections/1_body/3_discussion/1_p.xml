<p>Recent studies have indicated that Qi-invigorating and blood-breaking medicines such as 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic> could reduce the concentration, viscosity, and cohesion of blood, and inhibit intersegmental blood vessels selectively as well as improve microcirculation. The zebrafish model was used to explore the toxicity and determine the best dosage that could be administered during gestation, due to this species is highly homologous to human beings (87%), the transparency of the embryo, easy manipulation, short testing period, and small amount of testing drugs required are typical reasons for using this model. Our zebrafish embryo experiments found that the occurrence of scoliosis, pericardialites, melanotic pigment significantly decreased after treatment with 100 µg/mL volatile oil of 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic> and its vinegar-processed products. Teratogenesis of volatile oil of 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic> was more apparent than that of the volatile oil of its vinegar-processed products at the same dose. However, no abnormalities were observed using the same dose of the water decoction of this plant and its vinegar-processed products. Only a dose of the water decoction of 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic> and its vinegar-processed products at 200 µg/mL resulted in zebrafish embryos with scoliosis, pericardialites, and melanotic pigment decrease, and the symptoms were weaker than that using 100 µg/mL volatile oil. Therefore, the present findings suggested that the toxicity of the water decoction was lower than that of the volatile preparation. 
 <italic>Curcuma phaeocaulis</italic> before and after processing with vinegar was also toxic to zebrafish embryos and hearts, and the toxicity of the vinegar-processed products was lower than that volatile oil of 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic>. These findings indicate that processing with vinegar could reduce the toxicity in embryos. We have also determined that 24-hpf is a better intervention period for the study of anti-angiogenesis of 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic> before and after processing with vinegar in the zebrafish model. The optimised dose of vinegar-processed products or raw medicinal materials was 20 µg/mL, which could inhibit intersegmental blood vessels and maintain normal zebrafish embryonic activities. After processing with vinegar, the volatile oil of 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic> at a low concentration significantly inhibited intersegmental blood vessels.
