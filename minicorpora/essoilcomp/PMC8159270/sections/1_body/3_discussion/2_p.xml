<p>In the experiment of changes in toxicity of raw 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic> and its vinegar-processed products in female rats at sexual maturity, we established a blood stasis syndrome model based on earlier investigations. Noteworthily, we found that, compared to the control, the rats in each group showed lower weight gain, except for the model + vinegar -processed group, which showed no significant difference in body weight. Compared to the control, the wet weight and ovarian coefficients of model control and model treatment groups that contained 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic> were significantly higher, whereas there was no significant difference in the vinegar -processed 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic> group and other 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic> groups. These experimental results indicate that the effect of 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic> on control rats group was significantly higher than on the model rats, and the curative effect of raw 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic> was better than the processed product. However, to establish guidelines for clinically safe medication, further studies are warranted. The effects of 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic> in normal mature female rats and blood stasis syndrome were investigated, and the safety of clinical drugs was guided by the idea of ‘no death.’ The toxicity of zedoariae was also investigated. In conclusion, the present studies demonstrated that processing with vinegar could alleviate toxicity, and enhance anti-angiogenic activity. This study provides preliminary evidence for the effect of vinegar-processed 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic> and CHMs processing.
