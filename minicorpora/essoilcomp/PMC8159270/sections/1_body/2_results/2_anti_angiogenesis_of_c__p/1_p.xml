<p>The volatile oil of 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic> and its vinegar products could inhibit intersegmental blood vessels of 24-hpf zebrafish embryos after 12 h of treatment using a dose of 20 µg/mL without embryo teratogenic and toxicity, indicating that this dose could inhibit intersegmental blood vessels but not induce abnormalities in the zebrafish embryos. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref> shows that at a dose of 20 µg/mL, the intersegmental blood vessels of the group of volatile oil of vinegar-processed products became missing and disorderly, the main blood vessel was broken and obviously missed which indicated that the volatile oil of vinegar-processed products could significantly inhibit intersegmental blood vessels, whereas the group treated with volatile oil of 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic> exhibited slight inhibition. The application of 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic> processed with vinegar resulted in an increase in anti-angiogenesis in the zebrafish model. Collectively, these results show that vinegar processing enhances the anti-angiogenesis effect of 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic>.
