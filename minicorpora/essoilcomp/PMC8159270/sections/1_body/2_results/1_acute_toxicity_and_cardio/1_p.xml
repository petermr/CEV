<p>The 0.5% DMSO aqueous solution showed no obvious toxicity in zebrafish. The LC
 <sub>50</sub> values of volatile oil of 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic> and its vinegar-processed products in zebrafish were 67.315 and 95.755 µg/mL, respectively. The LC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the water decoction of 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic> and its vinegar-processed products were 161.440 and 206.239 µg/mL, respectively. Our results showed that the toxicity of vinegar-processed products was significantly lower than that of raw 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic> in forms of both volatile oil and water decoction; the toxicity of 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic> and its vinegar products water decoctions were dramatically lower than volatile oil (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>). Furthermore, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref> showed that the volatile oil of 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic> has teratogenic effects on zebrafish embryos, there have been varying degrees of scoliosis, pericardial edoema, less melanin phenomenon, and the similar concentrations of raw products volatile oil have more serious trend on teratogenic effects embryos than the vinegar products. Therefore, our results also comfirmed that the vinegar-processed products induced lower toxicity than raw 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic> through comparing the development characteristic of zebrafish embryonic at different time points. In addition, The raw products volatile oil of 
 <italic>C. phaeocauli</italic>s trend on zebrafish cardiac toxicity was the most obvious, emerging the heart membrane bleeding, blood cells accumulate in the heart area phenomenon, the trend of the increase of the heart rate and the time of the function of the time were obviously decreased (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>). And the cardiotoxicity of zebrafish embryos was most prominent when the dose of volatile oil of 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic> was 20 and 50 µg/mL, respectively. While the volatile oil of vinegar products has no obvious toxic effect on the heart. Therefore, our results showed that processing using vinegar could reduce the toxicity of 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic> in a zebrafish model.
