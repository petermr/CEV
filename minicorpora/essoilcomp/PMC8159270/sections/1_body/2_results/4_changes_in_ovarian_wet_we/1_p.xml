<p>Compared to the control group, the ovary wet weights and ovary coefficient of each experimental group were higher. There was a significant difference in the wet weights and ovary coefficient of the ovaries among the CR, CV, MR comparing with control groups (*
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The wet weight and ovary coefficient of the ovaries of the model group was significantly higher than in the control group (
 <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.01). Compared to the model group, the ovary weight and ovary coefficient of the control group was markedly lower than the model group, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, whereas that of the ovary weight of MD group was significantly higher than the model group (
