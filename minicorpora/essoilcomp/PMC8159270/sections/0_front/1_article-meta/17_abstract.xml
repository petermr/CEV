  <title>Context</title>
  <p>Processing with vinegar could enhance the efficacy and reduce the toxicity of 
   <italic>Curcuma phaeocaulis</italic> Valeton. (Zingiberaceae), a Chinese herbal medicine with anti-inflammatory and antitumor activities.

  <title>Objective</title>
  <p>This study investigated the vinegar processing effects by evaluating anti-angiogenic effect and toxicity of 
   <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic> through zebrafish and rat models.

  <title>Materials and methods</title>
  <p>Zebrafish embryos (AB and FLk-GFP strain) were applied to evaluate toxicity, cardiotoxicity and anti-angiogenic activity of volatile oil, and water decoction of the raw and vinegar-processed 
   <italic>C</italic>. 
   <italic>phaeocaulis.</italic> Meanwhile, a blood stasis syndrome rat model was applied to study the toxicity by measuring the ovarian and uterine coefficient.

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>
   <italic>Curcuma phaeocaulis</italic> volatile oil and its vinegar-processed products in zebrafish had an LC
   <sub>50</sub> of 67.315 and 95.755 μg/mL, respectively. 
   <italic>Curcuma phaeocaulis</italic> water decoction and its vinegar-processed products had an LC
   <sub>50</sub> of 161.440 and 206.239 μg/mL, respectively. The toxicity of vinegar-processed products was significantly lower than the raw, and the development characteristic of zebrafish embryos at different times confirmed these results. The volatile oil of vinegar-processed products could inhibit the growth of intersegmental blood vessels at the dose of 20 μg/mL, while the raw materials did not exhibit such effect at the same concentration. The rat experiment also confirmed that the volatile oil could reduce toxicity of ovarian and uterine.

  <title>Discussion and conclusions</title>
  <p>The study indicated that processing using vinegar could decrease toxicity and increase anti-angiogenic activity of 
   <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic>, which could be applied for clinical treatment. Further in-depth study on the synergism and detoxification mechanism of vinegar processing technology is needed.
