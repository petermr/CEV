  <p>Validation of expression patterns of 15 DEGs by qRT-PCR. The relative expression levels were calculated according to the 2
   <sup>-ΔΔCT</sup> method using β-actin as internal reference gene. Error bars represented standard error of mean. * indicated significant difference of the expression means at p &lt; 0.05 between L and S or L and R (n = 4). The relative expression of qRT-PCR was indicated on the left y-axis and the TPM normalized expression level (log2
   <sub>TPM</sub>) of RNA sequencing was indicated on the right y-axis
