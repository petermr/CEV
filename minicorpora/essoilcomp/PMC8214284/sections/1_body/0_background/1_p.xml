<p id="Par13">In the plant kingdom, trichomes are specialized tissues from epidermal cells with diverse structures and functions that play essential roles in resistance to stress, UV radiation, secretion, and accumulation of special compounds [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. One type of trichomes, glandular trichomes (GTs), can synthesize, store, or secrete various bioactive metabolites, such as terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, flavonoids, alkaloids, and acyl sugars, and are therefore known as biochemical cell factories [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. As a result, GTs are the main target for studying the synthesis and regulation of secondary metabolites in plants. The study of GTs in medicinal plants has attracted the interest of scientists, such as the GTs of

 <italic>piperita</italic>, and 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic>. Their GTs synthesize and store essential oils, which are widely used in fragrance industries, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetic products [
