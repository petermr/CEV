<p id="Par15">In the present study, we established the morphological and chemical characteristics of PGTs on the leaves of 
 <italic>P. frutescens</italic>. Metabolomics and transcriptome databases from different tissues were used to identify candidate genes involved in the biosynthesis of bioactive constituents, and the genes affecting the development of trichomes were preliminarily predicted. These results enhanced our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the biosynthesis of bioactive constituents in 
 <italic>P. frutescens</italic> and laid a solid foundation for the future investigation of trichomes, improvement of its health functions, and better-quality medicial plants.
