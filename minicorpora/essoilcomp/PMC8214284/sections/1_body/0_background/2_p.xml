 <italic>Perilla frutescens</italic> (L.) Britt is an edible vegetable and medicinal plant processed in cosmetics such as skin creams, soaps, and dermatological medicinal preparations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Two kinds of trichomes are present on 
 <italic>P. frutescens</italic> leaves, flowers, and stems with multicellular structures: GTs (peltate glandular trichomes PGTs and capitate glandular trichomes CGTs) and non-glandular trichomes (NGTs) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Previous reports have noted that the GTs in 
 <italic>P. frutescens</italic> were considered the primary tissue for essential oil synthesis and accumulation, especially PGTs. The number of essential oil components synthesized in leaves was positively correlated with the number of PGTs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The [
 <sup>14</sup>C]-sucrose tracer experiments showed that the monoterpenoid and phenylpropanoid components of the essential oil were synthesized by PGTs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Histochemical localization further indicated that terpenoids, the main ingredients of essential oil, were present in PGTs and not CGTs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Moreover, the metabolite profiles of PGTs in 
 <italic>P. frutescens</italic> have not been reported. In addition to essential oil, there are a variety of other pharmaceutically bioactive secondary metabolites that are synthesized and accumulated in 
 <italic>P. frutescens,</italic> such as phenolic acids (caffeic acid and rosmarinic acid), flavonoids, and volatiles (monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes), which give the plant pleasant green and purple colors, unique aromas, and medicinal uses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Several studies have focused on secondary metabolite profiling of different tissues of 
 <italic>P. frutescens</italic>, but only a few studies have examined their biosynthetic pathways, especially monoterpenes [
