<p id="Par40">According to the preliminary experiments, we weighed the leaves, stems, and roots (5.0 g) (accurate to 0.01 g). A total of 20 mL 80% methanol was added, and then tissues were extracted by ultrasonic extraction equipment (KH-300SP ultrasonic extraction equipment, Kunshanhechuang, China) three times for 30 min each. The extracts were diluted 10 times. The solutions were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min and passed through a 0.22 μm filter membrane. The collection of PGT secretions was the same as GC–MS, which collected about 500 PGTs in 80% methanol based on our preliminary experiments [
