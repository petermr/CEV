<p id="Par42">For TOF analysis, the mass spectrometer was operated in the positive and negative ESI mode with a duo-spray source, and the mass scan range was set at m/z 50–2000 for both TOF–MS and TOF–MS/MS scans. The following parameters were used: ion spray voltage, 5500/-4500 V; turbo spray temperature, 550 °C; curtain gas, 35 psi; nebulizer gas, 55 °C; collision pressure, 40 V; collision energy spread, 20/-20 V; declustering potential, 60/-60 V; ion release delay, 66.63; and iron release width, 24.92. Analyst TF software (version 1.6, AB SCIEX, Foster City, CA, USA) combined with information-dependent acquisition packing was used to acquire MS/MS data. The spectra peaks were identified via the database from related literature of
