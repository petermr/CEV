<p id="Par41">The metabolite profiles were analyzed on a triple TOF 5600
 <sup>+</sup> system (AB SCIEX, Foster City, CA, USA) with the ESI source coupled to a UPLC system (Shimadzu 30A UHPLC system, Shimadzu, Japan). For UPLC analysis, a 4 μL sample was injected into an analytical reverse-phase column (Agilent Extend-C18, 100 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.8 μm). The separation was performed with 0.1% formic acid in water and acetonitrile. The total running time was 34 min at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. The column compartment was maintained at 40 °C. The mobile phase used a gradient elution of 5%–70% acetonitrile (0–10 min), 70%–95% acetonitrile (10–28 min), 95% acetonitrile (28–30 min), and 4 min to return to the initial conditions of 5% acetonitrile.
