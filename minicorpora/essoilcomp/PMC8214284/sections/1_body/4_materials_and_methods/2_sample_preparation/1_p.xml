<p id="Par36">The volatile compounds were extracted from leaves, stems, and roots for 1 h using a modified simultaneous distillation extraction (SDE, modified Likens-Nickerson apparatus, Luxin, Shanghai, China). According to the preliminary experiments, 30 g of fresh tissue was accurately weighed and then mixed with deionized water in a 150 mL round-bottom flask. Then, it was attached to a modified Likens-Nickerson apparatus. The other round-bottom flask containing 50 mL of n-hexane was also connected to the apparatus. The round-bottom flasks were heated on both sides simultaneously. Water was passed through the condenser (DLSB-5L/25 cryogenic coolant circulating pump, Keer, Nanjing, China) containing 95% ethyl alcohol. The process was carried out for 1 h after the solvent in both flasks started to boil, and finally, the extract was collected in a brown bottle. Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> was added to the extract for dehydration. The supernatant was centrifuged and stored at -80 °C. For volatile oils in PGTs, we used the micropipette method. A capillary tube of 10 µL was drawn to form the tip of a tapered pipette using a needle puller (WD-1 microelectrode drawing instrument; Chendu, China). It was used to absorb volatile oil from PGTs on the abaxial surface of young leaves (node 1) under a stereomicroscope. Then, the tip of the capillary tube was broken into a liquid-phase vial containing 50 µL n-hexane. According to the preliminary experiments, the number of collected PGTs was approximately 240 and stored at -80 °C.
