<p id="Par43">The morphology and distribution of the GTs were evaluated using a stereomicroscope (SetREO Discovery. V20, Zeiss, Jena, Germany) and SEM (SU3500, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). The tissues were fixed with a slide and observed using a stereomicroscope. For the SEM, leaves were fixed in glutaraldehyde (2.5% (v/v) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.3) for 12 h at 4 °C. They were then washed with a phosphate-buffered saline solution (Thermo Fisher, Shanghai, China) three times for 15 min each and dehydrated with an acetone dilution series (30, 50, 70, 90, and 100%). Acetone was replaced with tert-butanol overnight. The material was dried overnight in a freeze dryer (FreeZone 2.5 Liter Benchtop Freeze Dry System, Labconco, Kansas, USA). The specimens were then gold-coated (EM ACE200, Leica Microsystems, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). The coated specimens were then viewed and photographed using an SEM.</p>
