<p id="Par45">The remaining clean reads were de novo assembled into transcripts using Trinity (version 2.0.6) with default settings. Transcripts with a minimum length of 200 bp were clustered to minimize redundancy. For each cluster (representing the transcriptional complexity for the same gene), the longest sequence was preserved and designated as unigenes. Unigenes were blasted against the NCBI Nr (NCBI non-redundant protein database), SwissProt, TrEMBL, CDD (Conserved Domain Database), Pfam, and KOG (eukaryotic orthologous groups) databases (E-value &lt; 1e-5). According to the priority order of the best-aligned results of NR, SwissProt and TrEMBL determined the Unigene ORF and the CDS and corresponding amino acid sequences according to the codon table. Simultaneously, TransDecoder (version 3.0.1) was used to predict CDS sequences of the un-aligned Unigenes. Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotation information was obtained according to the transcript annotation results of SwissProt and TrEMBL. KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) automatic annotation server (KAAS, version 2.1) was used for KEGG annotation.</p>
