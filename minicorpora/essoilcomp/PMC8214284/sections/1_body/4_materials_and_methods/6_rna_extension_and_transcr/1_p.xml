<p id="Par44">Total RNA from the three biological leaf replicates was extracted for RNA-Seq. Total RNA from four biological replicates from each of the plant parts (leaves, stems, and roots) was extracted for qRT-PCR. RNA degradation and contamination were monitored using 1% agarose gels. RNA purity was checked using a Nano Photometer spectrophotometer (Implen, Westlake Village, CA, USA). RNA concentration was measured using the Qubit RNA Assay Kit in Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). RNA integrity was assessed using the RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit of the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). cDNA library preparation for sequencing, data assessment, quality control, and RNA-seq assessment are provided in Supplementary file
