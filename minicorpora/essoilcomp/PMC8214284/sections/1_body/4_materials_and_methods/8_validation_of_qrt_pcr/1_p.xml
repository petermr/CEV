<p id="Par47">To validate the accuracy of the transcriptome, 15 candidate genes involved in the flavonoid, rosmarinic acid, terpenoid biosynthetic pathways, and trichome development were selected and performed using QuantStudio 3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). The qPCR protocol was 95 °C for 30 s, 95 °C for 10 s, and 60 °C for 30 s for 40 cycles, along with melting curve analysis. The gene-specific primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM17" ref-type="media">S8</xref>. β-actin (TRINITY_DN47478_c3_g1) was used as an internal reference [

 <sup>−∆∆CT</sup> method was used to calculate the relative gene expression levels. For each gene, four biological replicates were used in qRT-PCR experiments.
