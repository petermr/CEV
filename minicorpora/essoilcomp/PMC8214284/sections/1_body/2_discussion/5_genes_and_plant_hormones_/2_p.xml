<p id="Par33">In addition, GA and JA hormones regulated trichome development through the transcriptional regulation of 
 <italic>ZFP</italic> and 
 <italic>JAZ</italic>, respectively (Supplementary Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="MOESM14" ref-type="media">14</xref>). Although trichome types in the above three kinds of plants were diverse, the hormone regulation of trichome development shared similar patterns. Thus, in the plant kingdom, plant hormones may share a common regulatory network. Besides regulating trichomes, JA and GA can increase the synthesis of secondary metabolites, such as terpenoids. JAZ and DELLA can be degraded by exogenous application of JA and GA, then the transcriptional activity of 
 <italic>MYC2</italic> was released, which promoted the expression of 
 <italic>TPS</italic> and increased the synthetic rate of terpenoids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. 
 <italic>JAR1</italic> and 
 <italic>MYC2</italic>, known as activated transcription factors in the JA signaling pathway, were highly expressed in the leaves. Their high expression can increase the content of phenylpropanoids, terpenoids, and alkaloids, which played an essential role in regulating stress signal transduction in plants [

 <italic>P. frutescens</italic> with high medicinal and nutritional qualities is a future target. There will be great interest in investigating the molecular basis of 
 <italic>P. frutescens</italic> trichome development and the complete characterization of monoterpene biosynthesis.
