<p id="Par32">Compared with the transcriptomes of leaves with dense trichomes and roots without trichomes, the genes related to trichome initiation and development could be preliminarily analyzed by qRT-PCR. Some homologous genes related to trichome initiation and development were selected from our data (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). In 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, TTG1, GL3, and GL1 consist of the WD40/bHLH/MYB complex, which regulates downstream 
 <italic>GL2</italic> and 
 <italic>TTG2</italic> expression to stimulate the differentiation of epidermal cells into non-trichomes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In 
 <italic>A. annua</italic>, 
 <italic>AaHD8</italic> interacts with 
 <italic>AaMIXTA1</italic> and regulates the expression of 
 <italic>AaHD1</italic> to induce GT initiation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. 
 <italic>SlMX1,</italic>
 <italic>SlCD2</italic>, the closest homologs of 
 <italic>AaHD8</italic>, 
 <italic>WOOLLY</italic>, 
 <italic>SlMYC1</italic>, and 
 <italic>SlCycB2</italic>, positively regulate the initiation of GTs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The expression patterns of homologous genes of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> and tomato were similar, and most genes were highly expressed in the leaves. However, the expression of homologous genes in 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> was entirely different. The functions of these homologous genes will be further studied in 
 <italic>P. frutescens</italic>. Due to their diverse trichome types, the trichome in 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> was a single-celled NGT, while 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> and tomato have multicellular GTs, which are similar to GTs in 
 <italic>P. frutescens</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), suggesting that the gene regulatory network of GTs formation was different from NGTs formation in 
 <italic>A. thaliana.</italic> However, several genes may have a conserved function in the regulation of trichome initiation in 
 <italic>A. thaliana, A. annua,</italic> and tomato [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. For example, 
 <italic>AtMYB61</italic> in 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> was the ortholog of 
 <italic>A. annua AaMYB1</italic>, and myb61 mutants showed lower NGT density, suggesting that 
 <italic>AtMYB61</italic> positively regulated NGTs initiation in 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]
 <italic>; SlTRY</italic> was the ortholog of 
 <italic>AtTRY,</italic> an inhibitor of NGT initiation in 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. When transforming 
 <italic>SlTRY</italic> into 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, the development of NGTs was significantly inhibited [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].
