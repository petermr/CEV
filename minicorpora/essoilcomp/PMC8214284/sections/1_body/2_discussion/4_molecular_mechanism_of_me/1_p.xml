<p id="Par30">Monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are the main components of the volatile oil in 
 <italic>P. frutescens</italic>. Crossing experiments between the principal types of 
 <italic>Perilla</italic> suggested that the different chemotypes were under strict genetic control [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The main components of volatile oil in these chemotypes were generated from the mevalonic and shikimic acid pathways (Supplementary Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="MOESM15" ref-type="media">15</xref>). The presence of the 
 <italic>G</italic> gene is essential for the initiation of monoterpenoid biosynthesis via the mevalonic acid pathway. When the initiation was controlled by the recessive gene 
 <italic>h</italic>, tans-citral was catalyzed by geranyl pyrophosphate, and under the regulation of multiple genes, perillaketone was finally generated [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Although the biosynthetic pathways for essential oils in 
 <italic>Perilla</italic> have been described, the key genes controlling these pathways are still unknown. However, the lack of the 
 <italic>Perilla</italic> genome made it a great challenge to unravel the complete biosynthesis pathway of monoterpenes in 
 <italic>P. frutescens</italic>. A large number of unannotated unigenes (44.03%, Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM17" ref-type="media">S5</xref>) in our transcriptome needed further exploration, which may be annotated as the key genes for the synthesis of perillaketone in the future.
