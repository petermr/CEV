<p id="Par31">The key gene for anthocyanidin, 
 <italic>ANS</italic>, is located in the epidermal cells of the stems, where anthocyanins accumulate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The stem transverse section in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM16" ref-type="media">16</xref> shows similar results. 
 <italic>ANS</italic>, 
 <italic>DFR</italic>, 
 <italic>BZ1</italic>, and 
 <italic>UGT75C1</italic> were the key genes in the biosynthetic pathway of malonylshisonin, and these DEGs expressed highly in leaves were consistent with anthocyanin intensity in LC–MS data. The biosynthesis of rosmarinic acid is generated from both the general phenylpropanoid pathway and a tyrosine-derived pathway [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The 
 <italic>RAS</italic> coupled products from the two pathways and then hydroxylated by 
 <italic>CYP98A14</italic> to form rosmarinic acid (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Seven DEGs were annotated as 
 <italic>RAS</italic> (5) and 
 <italic>CYP98A14</italic> (2), and most of them were highly expressed in roots with the lowest rosmarinic acid intensity. This observation may be attributed to the possible involvement of the predicted genes in other metabolic pathways in the roots.
