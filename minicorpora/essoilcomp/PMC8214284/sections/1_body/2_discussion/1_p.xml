 <italic>P.frutescens</italic> is a well-known medicinal and edible plant that has been widely cultivated in Asia more than 2000 years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The leaves and stems often present green or purple colors. Volatile oil is one of the main components of 
 <italic>P. frutescens</italic>, and different chemotypes have been described based on the main components of essential oils [

 <italic>P. frutescens</italic> in our study was identified as a PK-II type cultivated widely in China. To further mine nutraceutical and medicinal potential, we integrated metabolite profiling and transcriptome analysis of different tissues. Additionally, we displayed the metabolic profiles of PGT secretion for the first time.
