<p id="Par17">The components of volatile oil contributed the most to the aroma of 
 <italic>P. frutescens</italic> and were the active ingredients in the drugs. Volatile oil was the primary evaluation criterion for the quality of medicinal materials in the 
 <italic>Chinese Pharmacopeia</italic> (2015 edition). We measured leaves, stems, roots, and PGT volatiles in plants by GC–MS to investigate the volatile constituents. Essential oil was collected by SDE from leaves (enriched in PGTs), stems, and roots. Secretions from PGTs were collected using micropipettes diluted with solvent, and then analyzed by GC–MS. There were 16 peaks in PGTs, 19 peaks in leaves, 7 peaks in stems, and 7 peaks in roots. 13 peaks have been previously identified, and eight peaks were unknown. The results of the identified peaks are listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, and most of the peaks appeared 10 min later. GC–MS peak mass spectra for the compounds are shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>. Based on the GC–MS results, the oil composition of PGTs was similar to that of distillates from leaves (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a), implying that these PGTs were the dominant source of commercial essential oils. Among these compounds, terpenoids were shown as the leading group. Perillaketone, the main compound, accounts for approximately 50% of the volatile oil of leaves, stems, and PGTs, and the isoegomaketone content in leaves was close to 20%, which implied that the chemical type of 
 <italic>P. frutescens</italic> is PK-II [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Moreover, the volatile composition of PGTs, which are known to be the primary tissues involved in the biosynthesis or accumulation of volatile oil, was strikingly similar to that of the leaves, which shared 11 common identified compounds. The mass spectra of the primary compounds in GC–MS are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, containing perillaketone (4), egomaketone (5), isoegomaketone (6), β-caryophyllene (8), and (Z,E)-α-farnesene (11).
