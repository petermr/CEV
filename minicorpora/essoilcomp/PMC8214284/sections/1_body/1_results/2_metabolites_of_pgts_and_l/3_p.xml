<p id="Par19">The fragmentation behaviors of the above two compounds are shown as examples. The product ion mass spectrum of compound 10 (t
 <sub>R</sub> = 3.2 min) showed a deprotonated ion [M-H]
 <sup>−</sup> at m/z 179.0320. In the MS/MS spectrum, the distinctive product ion at m/z 135.0446 ([M-H]
 <sup>−</sup>-44 amu) corresponded to the loss of a -COOH moiety, which was confirmed to be caffeic acid (10), with the elemental formula C
 <sub>9</sub>H
 <sub>8</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Compound 27 (t
 <sub>R</sub> = 4.85 min) exhibited a deprotonated molecular ion at m/z 359.0772. The MS/MS fragmentation patterns possessed three fragment ions at m/z 197.0455, 179.0360, and 161.0243. The fragment ion at m/z 197.0455 was formed by the loss of m/z 162 fragment (m/z 359–m/z 197; [M-H]
 <sup>−</sup>-162 amu), which was determined to be the characteristic of a caffeoyl moiety [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The fragment ion at m/z 161.0243 corresponded to the deprotonated caffeoyl residue. Thus, compound 27 was tentatively assigned to rosmarinic acid (27) (C
 <sub>18</sub>H
 <sub>16</sub>O
 <sub>8</sub>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d). The identified caffeic acid and rosmarinic acid were confirmed using the retention time of the standard mixture (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref> A, B). Perillaketone and isoegomaketone were also identified by LC–MS using a standard mixture (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref> C, D).
