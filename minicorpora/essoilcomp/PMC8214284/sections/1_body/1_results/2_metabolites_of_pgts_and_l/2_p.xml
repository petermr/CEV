<p id="Par18">To comprehensively identify the metabolite profiles of 
 <italic>P. frutescens</italic>, the compounds were authenticated using LC–MS, which was dedicated to the 
 <italic>P. frutescens</italic> color and medicinal usage. Therefore, metabolite profiles in the four organs were tentatively investigated by UPLC-ESI-Q-TOF–MS/MS through the full scan negative and positive ESI modes. In our study, the compositions of different organs showed significant differences. Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM17" ref-type="media">S1</xref> shows the retention times, molecular formula, and mass spectral data (molecular and fragment ions) of the identified metabolites. LC–MS peaks and mass spectra of the compounds are shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>. We identified 71 compounds from 
 <italic>P. frutescens</italic> through negative and positive modes, of which flavonoids (16), phenylpropanoids (15), and terpenoids (13) accounted for a large proportion. There were 36, 63, 46, and 24 compounds identified in the PGTs, leaves, stems, and roots, respectively. Except for roots, the top three compounds in the other parts were flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, and terpenoids. Caffeic acid and rosmarinic acid were detected as the predominant metabolites [
