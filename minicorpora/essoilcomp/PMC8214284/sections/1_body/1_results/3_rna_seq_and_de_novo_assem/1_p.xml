<p id="Par20">Through Illumina high-throughput sequencing of different tissues of 
 <italic>P. frutescens</italic>, 52.8, 41.0, and 42.2 billion clean reads were obtained from leaves, stems, and roots, respectively (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM17" ref-type="media">S2</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM17" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). The clean reads were assembled into contigs and de novo assembled into transcripts using Trinity, yielding a total of 315,005 transcripts and 117,939 unigenes (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM17" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). A total of 117,939 unigenes were annotated using common databases including the CDD, KOG, NR, NT, PFAM, SwissProt, TrEMBL, GO, and KEGG, to which approximately 34.43%, 28.8%, 43.94%, 31.45%, 25.02%, 42.73%, 43.23%, 46.03%, and 4.74% of unigenes were mapped, respectively (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM17" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). Through homologous species comparison in the NR database, 36.32% of the unigenes had the highest homology with 
 <italic>Sesamum indicum</italic> (Pedaliaceae), followed by 
 <italic>Erythranthe guttata</italic> (Scrophulariaceae) (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>). The details of the GO and KEGG analyses are shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref> A and B.
