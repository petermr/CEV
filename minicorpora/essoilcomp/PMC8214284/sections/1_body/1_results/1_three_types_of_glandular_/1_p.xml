<p id="Par16">The whole plant of 
 <italic>P. frutescens</italic> is densely pubescent. Its leaves are green and soft purple on the adaxial and abaxial surfaces, respectively, which is called the “double color 
 <italic>P. frutescens</italic>.” The primary roots of 
 <italic>P. frutescens</italic> are shorter than those of the lateral roots (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The plants in our study were similar to the 465P and green/red 
 <italic>Perilla</italic> in previous reports [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The pubescence of 
 <italic>P. frutescens</italic> was composed of multicellular GTs and NGTs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The GTs were including PGTs, CGTs and another morphology GTs, with finger-like shape, named digitiform glandular trichomes (DGTs). These three type GTs all contained three parts including basal cells, stalk cells, and head cells, like GTs in other Lamiaceae plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These three types of GTs located on leaves and stems (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), which were captured using an SEM and a stereomicroscope. PGTs consisted of multicellular heads, one stalk cell, and one basal cell, which assumed a globular dome shape at maturity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> a, b). It should be noted that the secretions of PGTs are yellow when mature. PGTs were approximately 42–47 μm in height and 56–60 μm in diameter (with four and eight secretory cells) when mature. CGTs were smaller than PGTs, with a 23–28 μm diameter spherical head and 31–34 μm in height, characterized by a short stalk, one or two-celled head, and one basal cell (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> c, d, g, h). DGTs consisted of one single head cell, a longer stalk cell, and one basal cell (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> e, f). They were approximately 61–69 μm in height and 10–13 μm in diameter when mature (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>).
