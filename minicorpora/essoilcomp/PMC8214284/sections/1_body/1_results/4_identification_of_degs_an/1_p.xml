<p id="Par21">A total of 10,696 DEGs were collected with the filter criteria |FoldChange|&gt; 2 and q-value &lt; 0.05, including 4127 upregulated genes and 4088 downregulated genes in L vs. R, 2548 upregulated and 2574 downregulated in L vs. S, and 3203 upregulated and 2898 downregulated in S vs. R, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref> A). There were 1126 common  unigenes in three comparisons (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref> B). DEGs of S vs. R, L vs. S, and L vs. R comparisons were assigned to GO classifications shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref> A-C. The responses to stimuli, metabolic processes, and cellular processes included in the biological process were enriched in three comparisons; catalytic activity in molecular function was also enriched in three comparisons. To explore the molecular basis of trichome development among leaves, stems, and roots, a large number of unigenes were assigned to GO annotation (128, GO:0,010,026 trichome differentiation; 57, GO:0,010,091 trichome branching; 100, GO:0,010,090 trichome morphogenesis) (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM17" ref-type="media">S6</xref>). In the above unigenes, most were highly expressed in leaves or stems (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">11</xref>), which was consistent with the phenomenon that GTs accumulated at these organs. In the KEGG pathway analysis, pathways such as plant hormone signal transduction and biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids, flavonoids, monoterpenoids, terpenoid backbones, sesquiterpenoids, and triterpenoids were enriched in S vs. R and L vs. R. As for L vs. S, only phenylpropanoid, flavonoid, sesquiterpenoid, and triterpenoid biosynthesis were enriched, revealing the same trends as the distribution of secondary metabolites (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref> D-F).
