<p id="Par23">The leaves and stems of 
 <italic>P. frutescens</italic> showed pleasant purple and green colors, which were genetically controlled to accumulate a significant amount of anthocyanin (especially malonylshisonin) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In our study, 10 DEGs were related to flavonoid biosynthesis and upstream of anthocyanin biosynthesis, which were all highly expressed in leaves (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). Combined with phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and tyrosine-derived pathways, 21 unigenes encoding eight key genes were assigned to rosmarinic acid and caffeic acid biosynthesis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. DEGs in the above two pathways showed similar expression patterns, except that 
 <italic>RASs</italic> were highly upregulated in roots. Metabolites and other DEGs involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis are listed in Supplementary Fig.
