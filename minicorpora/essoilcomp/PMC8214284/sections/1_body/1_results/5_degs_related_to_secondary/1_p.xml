<p id="Par22">The pathways annotated in the KEGG database were involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. We combined the analysis of transcriptomic and metabolomic data to explore key genes involved in terpenoid, flavonoid, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis in three tissues. The metabolism of the terpenoids and polyketides subcategory contained eight pathways, and the largest number of DEGs (23 unigenes) were mapped to terpenoid backbone biosynthesis (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM12" ref-type="media">12</xref>). Corresponding to the metabolic profiles and terpenoid biosynthesis, we aimed at the biosynthesis of terpenoid backbones, monoterpenoids, diterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, and triterpenoids. Among these unigenes, 38 DEGs were identified as encoding 24 key enzymes that controlled terpenoid biosynthesis, and the details are listed in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM17" ref-type="media">S7</xref>. These unigenes were mainly mapped in the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate and mevalonate pathways (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Of the four 
 <italic>DXS</italic> genes, 
 <italic>DXS1</italic>, 
 <italic>DXS2</italic>, and 
 <italic>DXS4</italic> showed the highest expression in leaves, and they were located upstream of terpenoid biosynthesis. These results suggest that 
 <italic>DXS</italic> is important for the generation of 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate pathways and deserves further functional characterization. The genes related to monoterpene biosynthesis also presented the same trends, which may lead to the accumulation of monoterpenes [
