<p id="Par26">Fifteen DEGs were selected to verify the accuracy of the transcriptome data using qRT-PCR. These key structural genes are involved in the biosynthetic pathways of terpenoids, flavonoids, and phenolic acids, and trichome formation. Specific primers were designed using Primer Premier 5.0 (Supplementary Table
