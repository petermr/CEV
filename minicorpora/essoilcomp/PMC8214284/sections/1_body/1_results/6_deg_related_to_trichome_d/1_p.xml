<p id="Par24">Trichomes are classified as non-glandular or glandular. 
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> has single cell non-trichomes, whereas 
 <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> and 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> have multicellular glandular trichomes. The genes related to trichome initiation and development have been widely reported, including 
 <italic>TTG1</italic>, 
 <italic>GL1</italic>, and 
 <italic>GL3</italic> of 
 <italic>A. thaliana; MYC1</italic>, 
 <italic>MX1</italic>, and 
 <italic>CD2</italic> of 
 <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic>; and 
 <italic>MIXTA</italic>, 
 <italic>MYB1</italic>, and 
 <italic>HD1</italic> of 
 <italic>A. annua.</italic> According to these reports, 46 unigenes, encoding 21 key genes, were screened in our transcriptomesÂ (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Except for the 21 homologous unigenes of 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, the expression patterns of homologous genes of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> (13 unigenes) and tomato (12 unigenes) were similar. The homologous genes like 
 <italic>SlMYC1</italic>, 
 <italic>SlMX1</italic>, 
 <italic>SlCD2</italic>, 
 <italic>SlWOOLLY, AaMIXTA</italic>, 
 <italic>AaMYB1</italic>, 
 <italic>AaHD1</italic>, 
 <italic>AaHD8</italic>, and 
 <italic>AaGWS2</italic>, which have been reported to promote trichomes development, all expressed highly in leaves. Among the 46 trichome development-related unigenes, most were TFs belonging to R2R3 MYB, WD40, bHLH, and HD-ZIP IV family.
