<p id="Par25">Plant hormones have also been reported to regulate trichome initiation and development, such as gibberellin (GA) and jasmonic acid (JA) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Our transcriptome data analysis revealed that multiple genes were mapped to activated signaling pathways. In the GA and JA pathways, we identified 24 and 37 unigenes, respectively (Supplementary Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="MOESM14" ref-type="media">14</xref>). Additionally, 16 
 <italic>DELLA</italic> and 18 
 <italic>JAZ</italic> were screened among these unigenes, which negatively regulated the growth and development of trichomes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. As expected, most 
 <italic>DELLA</italic> and 
 <italic>JAZ</italic> were downregulated in leaves enriched with trichomes.
