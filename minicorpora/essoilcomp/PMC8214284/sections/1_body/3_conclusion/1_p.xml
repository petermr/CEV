<p id="Par34">In this study, we presented conclusive evidence for metabolic profiling of PGT-accumulated terpenoids (perillaketone, isoegomaketone, and egomaketone) and the transcriptome and metabolite profiling of leaves, stems, and roots revealing biosynthesis of terpenoids, flavonoids (malonylshisonin), phenolic acids (rosmarinic acid and caffeic acid). Genes, such as 
 <italic>DER</italic> and 
 <italic>ANS</italic>, related to malonylshisonin biosynthesis were highly expressed in leaves with a higher intensity of malonylshisonin. The genes belonging to the R2R2-MYB and HD-ZIP IV family, such as 
 <italic>MIXTA</italic>-like 
 <italic>and HD1</italic>-like, may regulate trichome development in 
 <italic>P. frutescens</italic>. This study provided new insights into the morphology, metabolic profiles, and biosynthesis pathways of the main compounds. In the future, further research is required to uncover a novel molecular mechanism of the regulatory networks involved in the formation of trichomes and monoterpenoid biosynthesis pathways in 
 <italic>P. frutescens.</italic>
