  <p>Chemical reduction and stabilization of MNPs. Reduction of the metal salt solution is done by the presence of secondary metabolites in plant extracts such as (phenols, polyphenols, and flavonoids) to maintain zero-valent metals. Then, MNPs with various shapes and sizes are yielded, followed by coating and stabilizing with capping agents (secondary metabolites). </p>
