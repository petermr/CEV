  <p>A simplified interpretation of the bottom-up and top-down ways. For the biosynthesis of metal nanoparticles (MNPs), the bottom-up method is used where small atoms and molecules are combined into clusters and then to nanoscale particles. Contrariwise, in the top-down method, the nanoparticles (NPs) are created from the bulk materials. </p>
