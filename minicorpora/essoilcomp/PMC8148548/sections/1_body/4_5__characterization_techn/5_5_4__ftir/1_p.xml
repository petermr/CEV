<p>FTIR is a robust, simple, and widespread analytical technique [
 <xref rid="B177-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>], applied to screen and evaluate whether or not the biological molecules of NPs are taking part in the synthesis [
 <xref rid="B160-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>,
 <xref rid="B178-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>]. Over and above, this method has been utilized to search for the interactivity between enzymes and their substrates at the time of the catalytic process [
 <xref rid="B179-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">179</xref>]. FTIR uses infrared radiation (IR) in which some are passing through the sample and some are absorbed, followed by a formation of the spectrum. The function of this spectrum is to make the molecular fingerprint, which in turn determines the identity of the sample [
 <xref rid="B180-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">180</xref>]. FTIR is used to characterize the formation of FeNPs synthesized from 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> and to detect the biomolecules responsible for causing the metal reduction and NP capping [
 <xref rid="B98-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. The leaf extract of a 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> sample has been examined using FTIR spectral analysis to reveal the biomolecules that acted as reducing and capping agents through the synthesis process [
 <xref rid="B109-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. Mo et al. [
 <xref rid="B93-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>] used FTIR to point out the potential biomolecules accountable for the reduction and stabilization during the synthesis of AgNPs. FTIR was served to depict the leaf extract before and after the synthesizing of FeNPs from 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B95-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Pourmortazavi et al. [
 <xref rid="B88-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] used FTIR to examine how the plant extract is influenced by the extraction temperature and to analyze the interaction of AgNPs synthesized using 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> extract. The results observed that, while increasing the temperature, the peak intensity decreased. Golmoraj et al. [
 <xref rid="B106-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>] studied the surface chemical composition of AuNPs mediated using 
 <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> methanol extract by FTIR. In this context, the functional carboxyl group was detected, which has a key role in the stability of AuNPs.
