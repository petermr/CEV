<p>The general use of UV-vis is to inspect the shape and size of NPs in aqueous solutions as well as to determine the optical properties of that solutions [

 <xref rid="B165-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>]. In short, it is a process that measures the quantity of absorbed radiation via an ingredient in solution [
 <xref rid="B160-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>]. In UV-vis, the valence band and the conduction band, take their place where the movement of the electrons is free, then a band of surface plasmon resonance is produced according to the resonance oscillation of NPs with the wave of fallen light [

 <xref rid="B167-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>]. A wide range of studies has reported that each MNP has a special absorption band. According to the literature, AgNPs produce bands at about 200–800 nm that exist in the UV-vis spectrum, which is utilized to characterize NPs in a range of 2 to 100 nm [
 <xref rid="B160-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>]. This confirms the result by Sulaiman et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], which recorded the surface plasmon resonance at 413 nm. A study done by Mo et al. [
 <xref rid="B93-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>] investigated the wavelength of synthesized AgNPs from 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> leaf ranging from 400 to 500 nm. Moreover, 300 to 400 nm was the wavelength recorded by UV-vis through the synthesis of NiNPs from 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic>. Single wavelength peaks of 
 <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic>–mediated AgNPs started from 449 nm and gradually increased by extending the reaction time [
