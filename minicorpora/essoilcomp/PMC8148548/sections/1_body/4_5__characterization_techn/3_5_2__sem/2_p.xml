<p>The commencement of SEM revealed that under optimum conditions, AgNPs derived from 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> have around 50 nm diameter [
 <xref rid="B87-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Furthermore, SEM clearly observed the spheroidal shape of FeNPs from 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> leaf extracts [
 <xref rid="B98-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. SEM confirmed changes in cell surface structure and the deactivation of the important hospital-acquired pathogen cell membranes by using green synthesized AgNPs [
