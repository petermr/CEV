<p>The main biomolecules existing in 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic> leaf extracts are tannins and flavonoids [
 <xref rid="B79-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], which gives the possibility of use in pharmaceutical and agricultural areas [
 <xref rid="B63-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. A vast range of biomolecules is contained in the leaves of 
 <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> comprising tannins, proteins, flavonoids, saponins, and carbohydrates, which are important in the process of NP formation [
 <xref rid="B80-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Synthesis of NPs from different parts of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> trees has been extensively outlined in the literature. The presence of polyphenols such as flavonoids in 
 <italic>E. robusta</italic> leaf extracts is responsible for iron NP (FeNP) fabrication [
 <xref rid="B51-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Nickel oxide NPs (NiONPs) synthesized from 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic> leaves are beneficial in protecting human health due to their antibacterial activity [
 <xref rid="B81-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. While zinc oxide NPs (ZnONPs) have been greenly synthesized as antioxidants and photocatalysts from 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic> leaves [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. These characteristics demonstrate that 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> is a valuable genus that could be used for many purposes.
