<p>Temperature is one of the critical factors in the synthesis process that has a significant role in influencing the morphology of NPs [
 <xref rid="B153-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. NP size decreases with a higher reaction temperature [

 <xref rid="B159-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>]. During the biosynthesis of MNPs, prior to the change in color, metal ions are exposed to a certain temperature that varies according to the NPs and the procedure followed. AgNPs present a smaller size as a result of promoting the temperature of

 <xref rid="B106-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>] examined the stability of AuNP created from 
 <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> using three temperatures (4, 25, and 45 Â°C) and demonstrated that stability was achieved at all three.
