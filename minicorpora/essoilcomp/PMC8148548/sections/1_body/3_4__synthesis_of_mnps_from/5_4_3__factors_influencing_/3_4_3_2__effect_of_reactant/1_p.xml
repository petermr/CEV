<p>Metal ion concentrations are varied according to the parameters taken through the synthesis. Dubey et al. [
 <xref rid="B154-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>] found that a large particle size of AgNPs and AuNPs is attained by the higher concentration of the metal ion. Pourmortazavi et al. [
 <xref rid="B88-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] found that increasing from 1 to 5 mmol/L of metal ion concentration showed a larger size of AgNPs, while enhancement of the concentration to 10 mmol/L achieved an opposite result. Pinto et al. [
 <xref rid="B85-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] observed that a very low concentration of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> bark extraction plays a significant role in AuNP size in which the lower concentrations increase the particle size. Briefly, the addition of 50 mg/L of gold to 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic> leaf extract and essential oil was investigated in the preparation of AuNPs [
 <xref rid="B94-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. More-supplemented 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> extraction has led to the increase of the synthesis reaction rate in research conducted to prepare FeNPs from 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic> [
