<p>A study has been conducted by Rahimi-Nasrabadi et al. [
 <xref rid="B87-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] on the synthesis of AgNPs using 
 <italic>E. leucoxylon</italic>. The researchers have been appraised that the higher the reaction time, the sharper the peak. Other studies confirmed that the color changed to brown in a few minutes [

 <xref rid="B51-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] indicated the formation of FeNPs after 30 min from the addition of the extraction until the appearance of the changed color (black). Pourmortazavi et al. [
 <xref rid="B88-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] concluded that increasing synthesis hours would decrease the AgNPsâ€™ size.
