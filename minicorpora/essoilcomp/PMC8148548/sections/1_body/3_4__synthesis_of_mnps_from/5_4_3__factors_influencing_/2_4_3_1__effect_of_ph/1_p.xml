<p>The acidity and basicity of the medium have a major role in the formation of NPs in different ways such as influencing the surface morphological structure, precipitation position, reduction reaction rate [

 <xref rid="B155-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>], and stability [
 <xref rid="B154-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>] and contributing to the change of plant metabolite charge [
 <xref rid="B156-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. Spherical and decahedral MNPs are well fabricated under a higher degree of pH [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Specification of the pH value is usually done by a pH meter [
 <xref rid="B98-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. It is worth noting that few studies have addressed pH despite its significant role in the process of MNP synthesis [
 <xref rid="B156-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. For example, the preparation of AgNPs from 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B85-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] studied different values of pH (2.7, 7.0, 10.0), showing an effect on AgNP distribution size. A study by Liu et al. [
 <xref rid="B95-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>] also reported the formation of FeNPs from 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> using different pH values (4,6,8) and, thus, achieved the optimum removal efficiency of hexavalent chromium from hydrous solution at pH 4.
