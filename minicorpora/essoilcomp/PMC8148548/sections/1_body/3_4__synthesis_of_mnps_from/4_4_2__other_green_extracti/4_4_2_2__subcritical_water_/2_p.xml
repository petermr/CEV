<p>SW has been employed to extract several compounds from 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> species. According to Wu et al. [
 <xref rid="B128-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>], the ideal condition of SW extraction oil is under 300 Â°C for 30 min, which is enough to obtain 30.1% of bio-oil. In addition, Kulkarni et al. [
 <xref rid="B126-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>] reported the use of SW for the extraction of antioxidants from 
 <italic>E. grandis</italic>. Jimenez-Carmona and de Castro [
 <xref rid="B112-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>] isolated
