<p>Extraction with Subcritical water (SW) is a mechanism mainly dependent on water as an extractant at relatively high pressure to maintain the liquid form and temperature ranging from 100 °C to 374 °C [
 <xref rid="B112-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. SW facilitates fast extraction operation and utilizes low temperatures, which prevent losses of volatiles as well as the degradation of compounds [
