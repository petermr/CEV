<p>Based on the previous studies, microwave-assisted (MAE) is an extraction method adopted to obtain organic materials, inorganic and pesticide remnants from natural products [

 <xref rid="B130-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. It is an unconventional process used as an alternative mechanism due to its shortened extraction time, improved quality yield [
 <xref rid="B131-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>], and consumption of a low quantity of solvents [
 <xref rid="B132-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. Farhat et al. [
 <xref rid="B133-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>] highlight that the use of microwaves for extracting bio-oils is inexpensive and harmless to the environment. The MAE technique focuses on the absorption of microwave irradiation by the plant matrixâ€™s water [
 <xref rid="B134-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. The efficiency of the MAE method can be influenced by the material size, material-to-solvent ratio, extraction time, and power level [
 <xref rid="B135-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. Various bioactive compounds have been extracted from aromatic plants using microwave technology such as 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> [

 <italic>Cymbopogon martini</italic> [

 <italic>Cinnamomum camphora</italic> [
 <xref rid="B138-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. Bhuyan et. al. [
 <xref rid="B139-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>] extracted phenolic compounds and flavonoids from 
 <italic>E. robusta</italic> via MAE. Saoud et al. [
 <xref rid="B140-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>] found that exposure to microwaves for 3 min would be enough to extract 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> essential oil. Gharekhani et al. [
 <xref rid="B141-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>] obtained phenols and flavonoids from 
 <italic>E. camaldulensis,</italic> and Soet [
 <xref rid="B131-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>] also used this technique to extract 
 <italic>E. citriodora</italic> oil.
