<p>Plants have thousands of bioactive compounds used in various sectors, therefore it is crucial to quickly evolve and develop high-yield extraction techniques [
 <xref rid="B110-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. However, conventional ways require a long extraction period, which may cause thermal phytodecomposition [
 <xref rid="B111-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. Moreover, through conventional methods, some volatiles could be lost and toxic solvent residues could be produced [
 <xref rid="B112-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. In recent years, new extraction techniques have been developed and are being used as alternatives to conventional methods with low efficiency including supercritical fluid extraction, subcritical water extraction, microwave-assisted extraction (hydro-distillation), and pressure solvent.
