<p>SFE positively impacts the environment as it employs no, or only slightly, environmentally harmful organic solvents. The performance of SFE operation, as well as the oil yield, are impacted by various factors including extraction time, temperature, sample size and operating pressure [
 <xref rid="B120-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. Zhao et al. [
 <xref rid="B114-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>] reported that the extraction pressure and time are increased along with the increase in oil yield. Additionally, they demonstrated that the temperature moderately affected the extraction and reacted with pressure. Hence, it is important to adjust the right extraction parameters to eliminate any co-extraction between compounds [
