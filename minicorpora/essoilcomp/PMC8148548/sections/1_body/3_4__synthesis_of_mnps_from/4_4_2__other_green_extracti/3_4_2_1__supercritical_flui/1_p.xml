<p>Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) is a green chemical method that has been attracting considerable interest as a sustainable technique in daily food, fragrance, and pharmaceutical industries [

 <sub>2</sub>) is the popular solution used in SFE and has special physical and chemical properties including being nontoxic, non-flammable, and affordable. Moreover, it can be stored at low pressure and close to room temperature [

 <sub>2</sub> in SFE does not leave any residue; therefore, it offers an oil of high quality. In contrast with conventional extraction methods, SFE utilizing CO
 <sub>2</sub> needs low temperatures to operate, which maintains the thermally labile ingredients in the extracts [

 <sub>2</sub> is a non-polar compound; thus, it is not effective for extracting polar molecules. Introducing a co-solvent such as ethanol, water, or methanol increases the amount of the extraction yield [
