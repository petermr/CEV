<p>From the literature, the methodology of generating and reaching the final output of MNPs comprises several steps (

 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> extract, on which the synthesis of NPs depends. 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> parts are collected, followed by rinsing and drying several times, then the dried materials are powdered and added to deionized water. The resultant extract was then centrifuged for a few minutes and filtered to obtain the final volume [

 <xref rid="B39-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], the second step of synthesis is carried out by adding a relevant metal salt solution to the extract, keeping it at a certain temperature for a specific time until the color of the solution changes, which is an evidence of the reduction of the metal ion and NP formation. The produced particles are then centrifuged, washed and dried for use and characterization.
