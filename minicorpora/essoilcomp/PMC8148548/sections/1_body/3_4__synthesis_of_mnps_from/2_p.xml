<p>In the last few years, ample information has been collected and reported related to the synthesis of MNPs from 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic>. Several kinds of MNPs with different shapes, sizes, and characterizations have been synthesized from 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> such as silver NPs (AgNPs) [
 <xref rid="B93-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>], gold NPs (AuNPs) [
 <xref rid="B94-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>], FeNPs [
 <xref rid="B95-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>], and nickel NPs (NiNPs) [
 <xref rid="B81-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. As shown in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00929-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, AgNPs are the most popular among MNPs synthesized from 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic>, while few studies have been conducted on the synthesis of AuNPs, FeNPs, NiNPs, and bimetallic Fe/NiNPs. 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> leaves have been vastly used for the synthesis of MNPs [
 <xref rid="B51-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="B91-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>,
 <xref rid="B96-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>,
 <xref rid="B97-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>] while the bark and wood are rarely used. The use of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> leaves to produce MNPs is due to their richness in active substances such as tannic acids, volatile oils, flavonoids, and organic acids [
 <xref rid="B93-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Furthermore, polyphenols in 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> leaves act as antioxidants with the ability to control NP aggregation and as capping agents that improve MNP dispersion [
 <xref rid="B98-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. The abundant amount of phenolic compounds and antioxidant proportion in 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> leaves would be a determinant factor in synthesizing diverse MNPs [
 <xref rid="B98-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>,
 <xref rid="B99-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>,
 <xref rid="B100-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. On the other hand, the bark of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> is neglected and considered as waste. Despite this, it has abundant amounts of polyphenolic substances to produce MNPs [
 <xref rid="B101-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Different characterization tools have been used to reveal chemical and morphological features. In terms of the sizes and shapes of the MNPs, sizes are varied according to the selected procedure, while their shapes look spherical and cubic in most experiments (
