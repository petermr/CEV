<p>MNPs green synthesized via 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> have been applied in various primary research and practical life aspects due to their antibacterial, antioxidant, and anticancer effects. The current review showed that the green synthesis of MNPs is a cleaner route after considering its nontoxicity, simplicity, sustainability, and eco-friendly advantages. In simple terms, the main focus of the present review was on the mechanism for extracting MNPs from 
 <italic>Eucalyptus,</italic> which was based on standard steps starting from collecting plant parts to adding the metal salt solution and centrifugation to obtain MNPs. Furthermore, the roles of micronutrients existing in 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> have been displayed such as phenols and their derivatives in the synthesis method. Likewise, this review has summarized some factors (pH, reactant concentration, reaction time, and temperature) impacting the synthesis and the most popular characterization tools (TEM, SEM, UV-vis, XRD, and FTIR) used to reveal the characteristics of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic>-mediated MNPs. Although 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> is used for producing MNPs, it is a versatile genus that could be used for various purposes, and there is a need for further investigations in applications such as agriculture and forestry. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, it will expand scientist’s perceptions about the synthesis of MNPs from 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic>, thus enriching future empirical findings. Nonetheless, the interesting information reported in the literature about the synthesis of MNPs from 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> indicates a promising potential to follow the pattern of its cleared and discovered properties for further applications in various aspects. Hence, it would be easy to build and develop a nonpathogenic biological environment that can manufacture MNPs.
