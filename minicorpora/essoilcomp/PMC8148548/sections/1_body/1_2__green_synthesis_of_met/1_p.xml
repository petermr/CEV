<p>Over the decades, advances in MNPs synthesis, characterization, and application have been dramatically increased [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The most popular methods for the synthesis of MNPs are chemical and physical methods; nevertheless, these traditional methods are not affordable on a large scale and release toxic compounds, which determined their uses [

 <xref rid="B29-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. To counteract this problem, a novel, safe, and sustainable experimental method, known as the green method or biosynthesis of NPs, was developed [
