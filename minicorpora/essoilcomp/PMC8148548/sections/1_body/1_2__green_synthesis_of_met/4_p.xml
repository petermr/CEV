<p>According to Vitta et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], the green approach to MNP production is summarized as an oxidationâ€“reduction reaction that takes place due to the reductive capacity of the components inside or outside the cell. In turn, these components transfer electrons in the form of MNPs with a neutral charge (zero). The functional groups contributing to the conversion of metal ions into nanoparticles are ketones, carboxyl, alcohols, amines, sulfhydryl, and aldehydes, and the presence of any of these groups in any biological compound will demonstrate the success of the conversion process [
