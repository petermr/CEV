<p>Different plant parts could be used in the biosynthesis of MNPs such as root, shoot, leaf, and fruit due to their synthesis of super phytochemicals [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The active chemical agents in these parts include polyphenols, polyols [
 <xref rid="B43-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], phenolic acids, terpenoids, sugars, alkaloids, and proteins [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Chemically, these secondary metabolites are complex but are environment-friendly and play a significant role in reducing and stabilizing metallic ions [
 <xref rid="B37-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Micronutrients existing in plants and their derivatives are called phenols [
 <xref rid="B45-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Phenols in the plant extracts are the main compounds for the synthesis and stabilization of NPs [
 <xref rid="B46-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Salgado et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] reported that phenolic compounds act as effective precursors during the formation of FeNPs from 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic>. Polyphenols are favorable as anti-oxidants, anticancer agents, and antimicrobials [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The oxygenated terpenes formed are terpenoids, which are among the biggest natural product families present in all organisms [
 <xref rid="B48-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Essential oils are the source from which plant terpenoids are mainly acquired [
 <xref rid="B49-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The aforementioned metabolites are factors acting as metal salt reductants in addition to capping materials in the process of synthesizing MNPs from plants [
