<p>Nanoscience has an important role in modern medical technology, especially in cancer treatment. For instance, AgNPs prepared from 
 <italic>E. tereticornis</italic> demonstrated an antibacterial effect to be used in the industry of antibacterial drugs, antioxidant efficiency, and anticancer therapeutics to resist MCF-7 cancer cell lines [
 <xref rid="B96-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. 
 <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic>-based AgNPs are effective against certain cancer cell lines in addition to displaying antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="B194-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>]. AuNPs green synthesized utilizing 
 <italic>E. tereticornis</italic> have recently been reported to enter the world of medical and pharmaceutical activity. This is due to their antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiâ€“human breast cancer activities [
 <xref rid="B195-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">195</xref>]. Syukri et al. [
 <xref rid="B196-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>] observed that the covering of surgical sutures with AgNPs mediated using 
 <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> is a successful procedure to be used for treating wounds infected by bacteria. Paosen et al. [
 <xref rid="B104-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>] concluded that AgNPs mediated using 
 <italic>E. citriodora</italic> possess a great antimicrobial-resistance against serious hospital-gained diseases. Another investigation by Radwan et al. [
 <xref rid="B101-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>] using AgNPs from 
 <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> confirmed anti-aging properties, where they blocked apoptosis and hindered the formation of skin wrinkles. A novel medical discovery by Salih et al. [
 <xref rid="B197-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">197</xref>] aiming at investigating the effects of AgNPs biosynthesized using 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic> versus a worm parasite (
 <italic>Echinococcus granulosus</italic>) concluded that the synthesized NPs performed as a rapid sporicidal agent toward parasites, which are the leading cause of human liver cysts. The antioxidant influence of FeNPs prepared from 
 <italic>E. robusta</italic> opens a window to new pharmacological applications [
