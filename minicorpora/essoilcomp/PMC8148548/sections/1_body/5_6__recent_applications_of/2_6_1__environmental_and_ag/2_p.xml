<p>In the field of renewable energy, AgNPs have been prepared from 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic> in combination with 
 <italic>Azadirachta indica</italic> and 
 <italic>Coriandrum sativum</italic>. In addition, AgNPs are effective antireflectors when wrapped around the outer layer of a silicon solar cell [

 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> extracts are also exploited in the field of agriculture. 
 <italic>E. officinalis</italic> is utilized in preparing AgNPs, where the produced NPs can increase rice productivity by exhibiting a nematocidal entity to dominate root and soil nematode growth [

 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> nanoextracts as pesticide and fungicide products to increase the agricultural production in a safe and a sustainable way. For example, FeNPs are applicable to be exploited in pest management against 
 <italic>Rhizoctonia solani</italic>, 
 <italic>Botrytis cinerea,</italic> and 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> besides the antifeedant activity against diamondback moth [

 <italic>E. globulus</italic> extract makes it very suitable to be used in pest management as a botanical insecticide against the aphid species 
 <italic>Myzus persicae</italic> [
