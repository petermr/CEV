<p>Environmental remediation applications have been reported by many researchers. The capacity of biosynthesized FeNPs mediated using 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> leaf extract to remediate eutrophic wastewater has been confirmed [

 <xref rid="B186-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>] examined the efficiency of FeNPs mediated through 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> to eliminate arsenic from polluted areas, which added a piece of knowledge about the fabricated NPs as they have high adsorption capability and considerable environmental application regarding the removal of arsenic. Similarly, the high efficiency of calcined bimetallic Fe/PdNPs using 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> leaves to purify contaminated drink water resources from arsenic (III) has been observed [

 <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic>. The authors of the study demonstrated that AgNPs proved to be great antibacterial and antifungal candidates in cleaning the wastewater system and liquid residues from dyes [
