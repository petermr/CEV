<p>This review discusses the synthesis of MNPs from 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> (family Myrtaceae), an evergreen woody plant native to many regions in the world [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> is a good exporter of bioactive molecules such as terpenoids and phenols, and its organs have been perfectly used in the green route of MNPs synthesis [
 <xref rid="B26-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Thus, this comprehensive review summarizes the most important literature about the synthesis of MNPs using 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> species. Moreover, the factors that influence the production process, characterization techniques, and potential recent applications are also highlighted.
