<p>Nanotechnology is a multidisciplinary, modern, and innovative generation of applied science [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] concerned with the application, synthesis, and design of devices and materials on the nanoscale (smaller than 100 nm) [
 <xref rid="B2-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The earliest discussion of the possible consequences of nanotechnology can be traced back to 1986, when Eric Drexler developed some nanotechnology techniques along with other technological advances [
 <xref rid="B3-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Over the past years, the advances of nanotechnology have been significantly sparked in the fields of medical, agriculture, and forestry [

 <xref rid="B6-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. To develop an efficient synthesis of nanoparticles (NPs), different biological, chemical, and physical strategies have been applied [

 <xref rid="B8-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The synthesis of NPs using conventional methods may increase the environmental pollution and toxicity risk due to the production of by-products [
 <xref rid="B9-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Recently, more interest has been gained, focusing on environment-friendly strategies to produce NPs [

 <xref rid="B12-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Unlike the mentioned chemical and physical techniques, the biological strategy relies on employing living organisms such as plants, fungi, and bacteria to synthesize the metal nanoparticles (MNPs) [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The synthesis of engineered MNPs is mainly divided into two modes as seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00929-f001">Figure 1</xref>. The first approach is a top-down synthesis technique, where the large bulk materials are segmented into NPs [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In contrast, a bottom-up (self-assembly) technique entails an arrangement of small fragments into more complex structures [
 <xref rid="B15-plants-10-00929" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Chemical and biological methods of synthesis commonly use the bottom-up approach in which the obtained MNPs are chemically homogeneous and relatively pure [
