<p>Chowdappa et al. [
 <xref rid="B5-biomolecules-11-00768" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] isolated bioactive siderophores from endophytic fungi obtained from 
 <italic>Cymbidium aloifolium</italic> (medicinal orchid plant) and studied their potential application as antimicrobial agents against phytopathogens in crop plants. These antimicrobial siderophores acted as effective chelating agents with transition metals, forming soluble complexes with Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>. The authors also showed that these siderophores inhibited virulent plant pathogens such as 
 <italic>Ralstonia solanacearum</italic> (responsible for bacterial wilt in groundnut) and 
 <italic>Xanthomonas oryzae</italic> pv. 
 <italic>oryzae</italic> (responsible for bacterial blight in rice). The authors reported that 
 <italic>Penicillium chrysogenum</italic> to be the best among all of the tested fungi and may be utilized in the form of bioactive formulations for development of resistance against other phytopathogens in crop plants.
