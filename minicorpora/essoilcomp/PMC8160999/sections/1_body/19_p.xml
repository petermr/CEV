<p>Overall, this Special Issue has demonstrated the potential of a broad range of bioactive molecules isolated from plant-based materials to improve human health and well-being, as well as the potentiality for nanotechnology to improve the efficacy of these bioactive molecules. Clearly, this is an important area and there is need for much more research to be undertaken in the future to identify other kinds of bioactive molecules and nanoparticle-based delivery systems and prove their efficacy.</p>
