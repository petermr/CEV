<p>Eco-friendly metal nanoparticles can be produced by certain bacterial isolates that have potent antibacterial and antifungal activity. Mondal et al. [
 <xref rid="B6-biomolecules-11-00768" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) extracellularly using an environmental bacterial isolate 
 <italic>Citrobacter</italic> spp. MS5 culture supernatant. These biosynthesized AgNPs showed effective antibacterial activity against extended spectrum Î²-lactamase (ESBL) producing multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacteria. The AgNPs were reported to exhibit high antifungal activity towards pathogenic 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp.
