<p>Researchers have shown that capsaicin can inhibit the growth of some important food-borne pathogenic microorganisms, such as 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, 
 <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>, 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Penicillium expansum</italic>. It has also been shown to exhibit anti-virulence activity against 
 <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Poephyromonas gingivalis</italic>. Capsaicin is the main capsaicinoid playing its role as antimicrobial and antifungal agent and help as an analgesic in anti-inflammatory diseases like rheumatism, arthritis and diabetic neuropathy. A pharmaceutical carbopol-based formulation containing capsaicin extracted from 
 <italic>Capsicum annuum</italic> fruits, was synthesized by Goci et al. [
