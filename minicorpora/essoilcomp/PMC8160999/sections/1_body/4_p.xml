<p>Further, a Web of Science search with keywords such as ‘Antimicrobial nanoformulations’, ‘Antioxidants nanoformulations’, ‘Drug nanoformulations’, ‘Anticancer nanoformulations’, ‘Plant nanoformulations’, ‘Essential oil nanoformulations’, ‘Pharmaceutical nanoformulations’, ‘Food nanoformulations’, ‘Nutraceutical nanoformulations’, ‘Therapeutic nanoformulations’ was carried out. Accordingly, the publication trends revealed a rapid growth in the scientific interest in these areas (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-11-00768-f001">Figure 1</xref>). This search highlighted enhanced interest in the development of novel nanoformulation strategies for many kinds of bioactive agents. Much of this work, focused on the development of nanoparticle-based delivery systems to improve the stability, bioavailability, and efficacy of the bioactive compounds.
