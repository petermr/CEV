<p>On the other note, nanotechnology applications are being used to convert antioxidant and antimicrobial rich essential oils into water-dispersible forms, thereby enhancing their efficacy. Hemp is a widely cultivated crop to produce fibers and nutrients. The ability of hemp essential oil as act as an antimicrobial, anti-leishmanial and antioxidant agent has been reported recently by Menghini et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-biomolecules-11-00768" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The essential oils of three different cultivars of hemp (
 <italic>Futura 75</italic>, 
 <italic>Carmagnola selezionata</italic> and 
 <italic>Eletta campana</italic>), were evaluated for their antiprotozoal efficacy by administering them to mice intraperitoneally, which had initially been infected with 
 <italic>Leishmania tropica</italic>. The bio-pharmacological activity was exhibited by the compound selina-3,7(11)-diene, which revealed its affinity in the micromolar range towards proliferator-activated receptor Î±, cannabinoid CB2 receptor and acetylcholinesterase. 
 <italic>Futura 75</italic> and 
 <italic>E. campana</italic> cultivars showed higher content of selina-3,7(11)-diene, and had higher scavenging/reducing properties with stronger efficacy against the tissue wound induced by 
 <italic>L. tropica</italic>.
