<p>Moving ahead, breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in women around the world. According to U.S. Breast Cancer statistics [
 <xref rid="B11-biomolecules-11-00768" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], one out of every eight women will suffer breast cancer at certain times of her life. Treatment options may differ on the basis of stage of the disease, characteristics of the patient, and general health status. Treatment methods such as surgery, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or herbal treatments are gaining popularity and are continuing to develop rapidly. Recently, researchers are investigating biochemical and therapeutic routes that can utilize natural anticancer agents/extracts obtained from plants, microorganisms, and animal sources. In an article in this Special Issue, the anticancer activity of an extract isolated from a medicinal plant 
 <italic>Dorycnium pentaphyllum</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>haussknechtii</italic> was evaluated against different breast cancer cell lines, to determine invasion, adhesion, and lipid peroxidation [
 <xref rid="B12-biomolecules-11-00768" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The extract showed time- and concentration-dependent cytotoxic effects on MCF-7 breast cancer and MCF-12A as the non-cancerous cell line, in a XTT assay. The optimum concentration of the extract was ascertained based on apoptotic activity, invasion, adhesion, and lipid peroxidation assays. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the extracts to contain uercetin (an antioxidant compound). The mechanism of action underlying was elucidated along with the observed anti-proliferative effects, which caused tumoral cell death, but without any cytotoxic effects on human healthy breast cells. The authors proposed this to the high affinity of quercetin towards the enzymes: proto-oncogene serine/threonine-protein kinase (PIM-1) and hematopoietic cell kinase (HCK), which are involved in breast cancer.
