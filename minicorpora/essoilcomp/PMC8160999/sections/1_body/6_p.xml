 <italic>Alchornea cordifolia</italic>, a popular African medicinal plant that is generally used for various medicinal applications, mainly for its antimicrobial activity against various species of bacteria, fungi, and parasites, as well as its possible efficacy against inflammatory disorders. The article by Sinan et al. [
 <xref rid="B3-biomolecules-11-00768" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] has focused on the total phenolic and flavonoid contents of infusion extracts of 
 <italic>A. cordifolia</italic> leaves and have assessed its chemical composition. The findings of the study described the bioactive potential of leaf extracts such as enzyme inhibition and cytotoxicity activities on HepG2: human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, B16 4A5: murine melanoma cells, and S17: murine bone marrow (normal) cells. Bio-pharmacological effects of the extracts were ascertained and the potential mechanisms of action of the bioactive compounds in this medicinal plant were investigated using docking analysis. The researchers have reported on the presence of a number of bioactive compounds, including gallic acid, ellagic acid, shikimic acid, rutin, quercetin, myricetin, vitexin, quercitrin, kaempferol, and naringenin in methanolic and infusion extracts. Additionally, these extracts showed good cytotoxic activity against human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. This study demonstrated that 
 <italic>A. cordifolia</italic> could be a suitable plant source to further investigate the mechanism of action of the bioactive compounds present (as antioxidant and anticancer agents) for potential pharmaceutical applications.
