<p>Nanotechnology has been used to create topical delivery systems for enhancing the utilization and efficacy of bioactivities. A combinatorial approach was reported to develop nanoemulsion-based delivery systems containing imiquimod in combination with curcumin to improve the topical delivery of these bioactive compounds [
 <xref rid="B9-biomolecules-11-00768" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In the co-delivery system, curcumin acts as a therapeutic agent that minimizes the adverse skin reactions that are frequently related with the topical therapy of imiquimod. The nanoemulsion was dispersed in a hydrogel to develop a formulation suitable for topical delivery. This study claimed that the combination of curcumin and imiquimod in the nanoemulgel system to prevent the appearance of psoriasis-like symptoms compared with the imiquimod nanoemulgel and imiquimod gel formulation alone.
