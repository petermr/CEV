<p>Sudarsan et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-biomolecules-11-00768" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] optimized an eco-friendly approach to synthesize AgNPs using endophytic bacteria (
 <italic>Cytobacillus firmus</italic>) isolated from the stem bark of 
 <italic>Terminalia arjuna</italic>. These silver nanoparticles effectively inhibited bacterial growth in a dose-dependent manner. Results of this study showed good antimicrobial and antifungal activities against Gram-positive (
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus)</italic> and Gram-negative (
 <italic>Escherichia coli)</italic> bacteria, as well as pearl millet blast disease-causing fungi (
 <italic>Magnoporthe grisea</italic>). They also described the role of endophytic secondary metabolites in metal reduction, stabilization, and capping of silver nanoparticles.
