<p>Liposarcoma (LS) is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality and particularly poor prognosis, due to local recurrence and tendency to metastasize to the lungs and liver. Despite the development and clinical utilization of new targeted chemotherapeutic agents, improved radiation targeting, and surgical techniques, only a small increase in overall survival of sarcoma patients’ have been demonstrated over the last two decades. Hence, there is a marked need to explore much more effective and nontoxic antineoplastic drugs to enhance locoregional disease control and overall survival in sarcoma patients. A natural bioactive compound, 6-Shogaol, has been shown to exhibit anticancer properties in certain types of cancer. The study by Yadav and Jang [
 <xref rid="B13-biomolecules-11-00768" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] investigated the anticancer properties of 6-Shogaol against two different human liposarcoma cell lines (SW872 and 93T449 cells). This study revealed that 6-Shogaol to inhibit the growth of both cell types without affecting the normal cell lines (normal 3T3-L1 preadipocytes). The potential anticancer mechanisms of 6-Shogaol were attributed to the nuclear DNA fragmentation, increased sub G1 population, activation of the intrinsic caspase pathway, and PARP cleavage. In addition, 6-Shogaol also upregulated the expression and phosphorylation of GRP-78, eIF-2α, ATF4, and CHOP, which are known ER stress markers in SW872 cells, illustrating the induction of ER stress. The findings illustrated that 6-Shogaol to have strong antigrowth and pro-apoptotic effects on SW872 cells by regulating the intrinsic caspase pathway, oxidative stress, STAT-3, AMPK, and ER stress.
