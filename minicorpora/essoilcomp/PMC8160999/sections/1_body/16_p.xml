This study provided knowledge about the binding affinity and interaction mechanism of native and cross-linked proteins at different temperatures (25 to 95 °C). The authors claimed that β-lactoglobulin and CA were bound to each other through weak Van der Waals’ forces and hydrogen bonding. They also confirmed that there were various CA binding sites on the surface of heat-treated and partially denatured β-LG proteins. The authors reported that CA-β-LG and CA-β-LG
 <sub>Tgase</sub> complexes (ratio 1:1) to have exhibited significantly higher antioxidant activity and inhibitory effects on α-glucosidase, α-amylase, and pancreatic lipase, which are the enzymes associated with metabolic syndrome, when compared to the native proteins.
