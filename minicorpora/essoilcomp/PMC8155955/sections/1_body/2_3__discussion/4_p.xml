<p>The high soil and leaf aluminum contents are probably two of the characteristics that mark the most significant correlations between soil and leaf chemical elements of the

 <xref rid="B44-molecules-26-02949" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] mentioned that some soil ions (e.g., aluminum, cobalt, zinc and manganese), modulate the initial stages of biosynthesis of phenolic products in the plant. Hence, the soil chemistry can influence the phytochemical composition [

 <sup>3+</sup>) is the most limiting factor for plant growth in acid soils [

 <xref rid="B49-molecules-26-02949" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]; in the plant, it causes an alteration of the general metabolism, especially it inhibits root growth, which has as a consequence reduction in the intake of water and nutrients [
