<p>Following this pattern, calcium, iron, magnesium, manganese, nitrogen and silicium also marked a significant correlation between soil and leaf chemical elements in the different localities. Silicium was also found in high concentrations in the plant and in the soil, both mainly in the locality L1 with values of up to 7.2 ppm for the plant and 23.12 ppm for the soil. Some research on silicon has shown that its presence in the plant as a constant element and in large proportion [

In the case of nitrogen, values in the range from 7.11 to 8.75 ppm in soil were found, regarding the plant nitrogen content, we found that especially in L4 (Colaisaca) there was a higher concentration of this element with a range between 9.81 to 12.05 ppm, showing significant differences compared to the other three study locations. Studies on nitrogen mention that this element, as one of the important soil minerals, can alter the essential oil component through biosynthetic metabolic pathways [

These results agree with those found by Jabbari et al. [
