<p>On the other hand, we showed influences of soil and plant chemical elements in the composition of the essential oils of 
 <italic>Siparuna muricata</italic>. The quality and quantity of EOs of aromatic plants may be affected also by the physicochemical properties of soil [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-26-02949" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Various chemical elements in soil found in rhizosphere of plants enter into the enzymes and affect the biochemical processes of plants [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-26-02949" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The importance of soil in essential oil has also been reported in 
 <italic>Thymus hyemalis</italic>, since individuals that develop in silty soils have a greater quantity of phenols and low molecular weight metabolites, compared to individuals found in clay soils [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-26-02949" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In our work, a high variability of results in the content of the chemical elements both in the leaf of 
 <italic>S. muricata</italic> and in the soils of the four sampling locations was found. According to Cruzatty and Vollmann [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-26-02949" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], the content of nutrients in soils the related to its altitude gradient. The same authors state that the soils of Ecuador specifically in the sierra region (highlands), are little evolved and show high mineral contents, as is the case of our study areas, however, they have more acidic pH soils, because of stored organic matter and a high concentration of exchange aluminum.
