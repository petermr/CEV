<p>On the other hand, soils elements such as P, K, Ca, Mg and Mn were those with low concentration values. This is consistent with the comments made by Duran et al. [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-26-02949" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] in a physical-chemical analysis of soils that report concentrations even lower than those found in our study and who in turn mention that leaching, translocation and loss of the content of bases, cause an excessive accumulation of aluminum that generally decreases the assimilation of other mineral nutrients such as potassium, calcium and magnesium. Ross [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-26-02949" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] reports in this work acidic soils with an exchangeable magnesium content below 40 ppm, in our study, we found even much lower magnesium values in soils with values not greater than 5 ppm in the four locations, this low amount of magnesium in the soil is also reflected in the low amount of this element in the S. 
 <italic>muricata</italic> plant with values between 0.29 to 3.51 ppm. Both the exchangeable magnesium and the magnesium in the soil solution make up the magnesium available to the plant. Plants absorb magnesium exclusively from the soil solution which is replenished by magnesium from the exchangeable fraction. Magnesium deficiency in the plant leads to increased starch and dry matter content in older leaves, accompanied by deficiencies in carbohydrate supply to fruits, leaves, and particularly roots [

Who studied the effect of nutrition on the formation of palm oil shows higher oil/bunch ratios were produced through magnesium applications, so it can be that this element also influences the composition of the essential oils of plants.
