<p>The variations in elevation, soil and leaf chemical elements significantly affect the compositions of leaf essential oils (EOs) of 
 <italic>Siparuna muricata</italic> from different locations in the southern region of Ecuador. The soils of the four localities of our study revealed a high content of aluminum, and silicon and sodium. In the 
 <italic>S. muricata</italic> we observed that the nutrient with the highest content was phosphorus, and those in least abundance were manganese and iron. Additionally, correlations between soil and leaf chemical elements as such as aluminum, calcium, iron, magnesium, manganese, nitrogen and silicon in the different localities were found.
