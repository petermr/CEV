<p>The soil chemical elements and locations conditions affects different physiological and chemical processes of plants and therefore could affect significantly the yield and composition of EOs of 
 <italic>S. muricata</italic>. Therefore, it is necessary to develop out long-term studies to understand the effects of the environmental conditions such as topography, clime and plant phenology to better understand the interactive relationships between locations, and plant and soil properties in the chemical components of the essential oil of 
 <italic>S. muricata</italic>.
