<p>On the other hand, aluminum is the chemical element that presented the highest concentrations in the soils of the studied localities, with a range between 9.96 to 54.78 ppm. Silicon was the second element with high values, observing that in this case, L1 was the one with the highest concentrations ranging from 22.49 to 23.12 ppm. Sodium also had high values but this was observed in L2 11.62 to 14.44 ppm (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02949-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). The nitrogen and phosphorus had homogeneity of values in the four localities, in the case of nitrogen, values from 7.11 to 8.75 ppm were observed, and the phosphorus was between 7.01 to 8.21 ppm. On the other hand, manganese was the nutrient with the lowest concentrations between 0.05 to 0.01 ppm, in the same sense, potassium also has low values ranging from 0.15 to 0.73 ppm, however in both cases, observe the homogeneity of concentrations in the four study areas. Magnesium, on the other hand, presented values not greater than 5 ppm in the four locations, while calcium does not exceed 3 ppm, however in the latter case L4 was the one with the highest values compared to the other three locations in a range between 1.96 to 2.67 ppm.
