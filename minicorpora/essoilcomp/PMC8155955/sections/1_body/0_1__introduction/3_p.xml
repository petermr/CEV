<p>The chemical, biochemical and pharmacological properties of certain plants can be defined by the characteristics of the chemical components present in their essential oils, which can be obtained from leaves, roots and stems [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-26-02949" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Thus, elevation; precipitation; light; growing site; soil; anatomical, physiological and chemical variations between different parts of the plant, and from genetically-related factors might modify the qualitative and quantitative amounts of the volatile compounds in the EOs [

 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-02949" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The composition and concentrations of the compounds of interest (active ingredients) may be linked to the place of origin of the plant species and to environmental and edaphological conditions [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-02949" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. They affect some processes associated with growth and development of the plants, even their ability to synthesize secondary metabolites [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-02949" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The plants development and their production depend in part on the ability of the soil to supply and maintain an adequate amount of nutrients in the soil solution. Many of the nutrients that the plant requires for its development are found in the soil in varying amounts, and are sometimes insufficient for proper nutrition [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-02949" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Following this pattern, several studies found that plant species growing under different environmental conditions (e.g., altitude and soil nutrients) show significant differences in the composition of the primary and secondary metabolite composition [

 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-02949" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For instance, Zhao et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-02949" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and Kumari et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-02949" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] for 
 <italic>Herpetospermum pedunculosum</italic> and 
 <italic>Picrorhiza kurroa,</italic> respectively, found correlations between secondary metabolites and altitude; similarly, Sampaio et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-02949" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] found that the distribution of the metabolites in 
 <italic>Tithonia diversifolia</italic> was mainly affected by variation of some soil nutrients such as Ca, Mg, P, K and Cu.
