<p>The samples of the plant correspond to leaves collected manually, subsequently dried in an oven with forced air circulation for 24 h and ground to obtain adequate homogeneity. Nitrogen was determined using the Kjeldahl method modified by Ram√≠rez et al. (2013) [
 <xref rid="B62-molecules-26-02949" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] and its evaluation by UV-V spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 660 nm [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-26-02949" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The phosphorus was extracted with acid mixture (concentrated HNO
 <sub>3</sub> 65% and concentrated HCLO
 <sub>4</sub> 70%) and its assessment using the ammonium vanadate molybdate method by ultra violet spectrophotometry visible at a wavelength of 430 nm. For the determination of K, Ca, Mg, Na, Mn, Al, Cu, Fe, Zn and Si in foliates, digestion with an acid mixture was carried out (concentrated NHO
 <sub>3</sub> 65% and concentrated HCLO
 <sub>4</sub> 70%), from the filtrate of the digestion were taken an aliquots by adding lanthanum oxide for the cases of K, Ca and Mg to minimize interference and determine them by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry [
 <xref rid="B64-molecules-26-02949" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. For Na, Fe, Si, Mn, Cu, Zn and Al, the determination was made by direct reading in the filtrate obtained from the wet digestion and read in the Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer.
