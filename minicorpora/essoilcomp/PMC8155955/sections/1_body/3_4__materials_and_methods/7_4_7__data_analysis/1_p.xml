<p>Correlations between soil and leaf chemical elements of the essential oil of S. muricata were recorded in each locality using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was performed to detect patterns of similarity of chemical compound in relation to each locality. The NMDS was run using Sørensen (Bray–Curtis) as the distance measure, and the number of runs was 500. In addition, we used a cluster analysis (complete linkage) to classify all the secondary metabolites of the essential oil of 
 <italic>S. muricata</italic> in each locality. Clustering was conducted using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averaging (UPGMA). To identify the secondary metabolites of the essential oil of S. muricata that contributed most to the dissimilarity between the four localities, we used the SIMPER statistical routine. All analyses were performed using R statistical software version 3.1.13 [
