<p>The enantioselective GC analysis was performed on an Agilent 6890N, the instrument was equipped with a 2.3-diethyl-6-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-β-cyclodextrin enantioselective column, 25 m × 0.25 mm × film thickness 0.25 µm from Mega, Legnano, Italy, the following oven temperature program was used: 60 °C for 5 min, a gradient of 2 °C/min up to 220 °C, hold for 2 min. The elution order of the separated enantiomers was determined by injection of enantiomerically pure standards [
