<p>For the identification of the oil components was based in the comparison of peak retention time, retention index, and mass spectrum with that of authentic standards using a mixture of the homologous series of n-alkanes, from C9 to C20. The peak identification was based on the combination of linear retention indices and mass spectra with those reported in the WILEY275, NIST 17 and Adams [

Quantification of essential oil components was performed using GC-FID, with the same method and instrumental configuration described for GC/MS by peak-area normalization by considering an equal response factor for the different chemical classes.
