<p>GC/MS analysis was performed on an Agilent Technologies 6890 N gas chromatograph coupled to a mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies 5973, Santa Clara, CA, USA) using a DB-5 MS (5% -phenyl-methylpolysiloxane, 30 m, 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness; J &amp; W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA) capillary column. The oven temperature program was: 5 min at 60 °C, subsequently 3 °C/min up to 165 °C, then 15 °C/min up to 250 °C, held for 10 min. Injector temperature was 220°C, respectively. Helium (He) was used as the carrier gas, at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Split ratio, 1:50; acquisition mass range, m/z 35–350. All mass spectra were acquired in electron-impact (EI) mode with an ionization voltage of 70 eV. Oil samples were diluted to 1:100 in methylene chloride (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA, 99.9% purity), and the volume injected was 1 μL.</p>
