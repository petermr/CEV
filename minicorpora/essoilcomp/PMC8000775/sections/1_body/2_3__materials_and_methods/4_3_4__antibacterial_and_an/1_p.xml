<p>The essential oils were screened for antimicrobial activity against a panel of bacteria (

 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> (ATCC No. 12228),

 <xref rid="B49-plants-10-00488" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] as previously reported by us [
 <xref rid="B38-plants-10-00488" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Serial dilutions of the essential oils (2500, 1250, 625, 312.5, 156.3, 78.1, 39.1, and 19.5 μg/mL) in appropriate media (cation–adjusted Mueller Hinton broth for bacteria and yeast-nitrogen base growth medium for fungi) were carried out in 96-well microtiter plates. Microorganisms (1.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL for bacteria and 7.5 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> CFU/mL for fungi) were added to the 96-well plates, which were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C for bacteria and 35 °C for fungi. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined to be the lowest concentrations without turbidity. Gentamicin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was the positive antibacterial control, amphotericin B (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was the positive antifungal control, and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) was used as the negative control (50 μL DMSO diluted in 50 μL broth medium, and then serially diluted as above). (–)-β-Pinene, (±)-linalool, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene, and caryophyllene oxide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were also individually screened for activity.
