<p>Hydrodistillation of the leaves of 
 <italic>L. egregia</italic> collected from Agbegi-Odofin Village, Ikire, Osun State, Nigeria, yielded a pale-yellow essential oil with an average yield of 0.68 ± 0.2% on a weight-to-weight basis. The essential oil was analyzed by gas chromatography—mass spectrometry (GC-MS) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00488-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The essential oil showed monoterpene hydrocarbons (1.53%), oxygenated monoterpenoids (2.86%), sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (86.43%), oxygenated sesquiterpenoids (1.15%), and non-terpenoids (6.50%). The predominant sesquiterpene hydrocarbons include α-panasinsen (34.90%), (
