<p>As far as we are aware, there have been no published reports on essential oils from 
 <italic>Lannea</italic> species, so essential oil compositional comparisons at the genus level are not possible. Both α-copaene and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene are common essential oil components, including the Anacardiaceae (see, for example [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-10-00488" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-plants-10-00488" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]). Selin-4,11-diene, on the other hand, is relatively uncommon in the family, but has been observed in 
 <italic>Sclerocarya birrea</italic> leaf essential oil [
 <xref rid="B37-plants-10-00488" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and 
 <italic>Haematostaphis barteri</italic> leaf essential oil [
 <xref rid="B38-plants-10-00488" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Likewise, α-panasinsen is a rare volatile component in the Anacardiaceae, but detected as an aroma component of 
 <italic>Mangifera indica</italic> cv. Alphonso [
 <xref rid="B39-plants-10-00488" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and 
 <italic>Sclerocarya birrea</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>caffra</italic> [
 <xref rid="B40-plants-10-00488" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] fruits.
