<p>Both 
 <italic>L. egregia</italic> and 
 <italic>E. sonchifolia</italic> essential oils were dominated by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, with (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene abundant in both oils. α-Copaene, abundant in 
 <italic>L. egregia</italic> essential oil, was found to be only 1.5% in 
 <italic>E. sonchifolia</italic> oil. Selina-4,11-diene and α-panasinsen were major components in 
 <italic>L. egregia</italic> essential oil but were not detected in the essential oil of 
 <italic>E. sonchifolia</italic>. Likewise, γ-himachalene, abundant in 
 <italic>E. sonchifolia</italic> essential oil, was not detected in the essential oil of 
 <italic>L. egregia</italic>.
