<p>The essential oils of 
 <italic>Lannea egregia</italic> and 
 <italic>Emilia sonchifolia</italic>, medicinal plants collected from southwestern Nigeria, were found to be rich in sesquiterpenoids. Both essential oils exhibited antibacterial and antifungal activities that are consistent with traditional uses of the plants. While sesquiterpene hydrocarbons were the predominant chemical class in both essential oils, it is not apparent which individual components may be responsible for the antimicrobial activity. It is likely, however, that synergistic effects are also responsible for the activities of the components. Nevertheless, the essential oils may be recommended for further exploration as complementary antimicrobial agents.
