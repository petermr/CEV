  <p>The embryotoxicity of different concentrations of ZO essential oil in the time–kill analysis of embryonic zebrafish. Zebrafish embryos were treated with 0.1% DMSO (control), and 0.24, 0.49, 0.98, 1.95 and 3.91 µg/mL of ZO essential oil. The Kaplan–Meier curve shows the average survival rate in six different groups in the three independent experiments (
   <italic>n</italic> = 60 embryos/group). The log-rank test was used for statistical analysis (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001).
