  <p>The embryotoxicity of different concentrations of ZO essential oil in embryonic zebrafish. Zebrafish embryos were treated with a series of twofold dilution concentrations (0.24–3.91 µg/mL). Percentages of embryonic mortality were calculated from embryo deaths after exposure to ZO essential oil at 0.24, 0.49, 0.98,1.95, 3.91 µg/mL, and 0.1% DMSO (control). Data represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments (
   <italic>n</italic> = 60 embryos/group). Experiments were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison test. Different lowercase letters indicate significant differences between groups (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).
