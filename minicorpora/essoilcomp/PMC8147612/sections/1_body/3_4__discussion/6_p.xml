<p>Additionally, as an initial step in drug development, we performed an acute oral toxicity study in rats to evaluate the safe dose of this medicinal plant in an in vivo model, which provides for more toxic expression, including general appearance and behavioral changes, than in vitro assay. Specifically, in our current study, each rat received a single dose of ZO essential oil (2000 mg/kg), and the results showed no mortality of any rats, no significant changes in the percentage of body weight gain, daily food, and water consumption, and no differences in relative organ weight along with normal organ appearance and structures in gross pathology and histopathology analysis, when compared to the control group (

These temporary effects could imply that ZO essential oil may possess CNS-depressant or sedative-hypnotic effects. This result is in agreement with a previous in vivo study of terpenes, e.g., terpinen-4-ol, which is a compound that has sedative and anesthetic effects in fish [
