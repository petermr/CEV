<p>Development deformities in zebrafish embryos were observed in the groups treated with 0.49–3.91 µg/mL of ZO essential oil. Deformities of body parts or organs included a dented tail, failure of tail detachment, spinal curvature, pericardial sac edema, and poor reabsorption of yolk (

These findings suggest that the accessibility of the ZO essential oil introduced into the animal’s body increases with the duration of exposure and eventually leads to embryotoxicity. This phenomenon may be caused by the alternation of the embryo protective layer (chorion) protein, which may result in opening and widening of the chorion pore channel during normal development of the zebrafish leading to weakened and damaged chorion, which, in turn, allows more ZO essential oil to pass into the embryos [
