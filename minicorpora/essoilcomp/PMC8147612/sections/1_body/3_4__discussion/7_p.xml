<p>The present study revealed the monoterpene and sesquiterpene compounds in ZO essential oil and determined the toxicological profiles of the essential oil in zebrafish embryos and larvae. However, in the acute oral toxicity study in rats, ZO essential oil exhibited only temporary alteration of some general appearance characteristics without other significant toxicity or inducing death. Since routes of administration of ZO essential oil in the zebrafish model (topical route) and the rat model (oral route) were different, the toxic concentrations of ZO essential oil in the zebrafish model cannot be directly compared with the doses of ZO essential oil in the rat model. Moreover, the teratogenic effect of any substance depends on the ability of that substance to cross the placental barrier. In addition, some compounds found to be toxic in a rat embryotoxicity study were also found to cause deformities in zebrafish [

However, further confirmation of safety profiles of ZO essential oil in long-term toxicity studies, especially with other higher-order vertebrates, is needed. Such toxicological studies using different animal species are necessary to confirm the safety of any novel commercial pharmaceutical products containing ZO essential oil.
