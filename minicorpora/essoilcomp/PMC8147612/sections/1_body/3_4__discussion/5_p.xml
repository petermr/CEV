<p>A decrease in the hatching rate of zebrafish embryos and a delayed hatching process were observed, which are events correlated with increasing concentrations of ZO essential oil (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxics-09-00102-f005">Figure 5</xref>A). A low hatchability rate and delayed hatching process normally indicate growth retardation, which may be due to abnormal embryo development. In particular, it may be related to a decreased chorion breaking ability resulting from the inhibition of the tetraspanin gene (
