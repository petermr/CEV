<p>Prior to performing safety studies in a rodent model, a toxicological assay of vertebrate zebrafish has been proposed as a tractable model for screening potentially suitable phytochemical concentrations in whole more complex organisms. The present study provides a toxicity assessment of ZO essential oil in zebrafish embryos. This study observed no embryotoxic mortality or malformation when using the lowest concentration of ZO essential oil (0.24 µg/mL), indicating that this concentration is not toxic to fish embryos. In contrast, increases in ZO essential oil concentrations were found to be related to higher rates of embryonic mortality and death of all embryos at the concentrations of 3.91 and 1.95 µg/mL, at 96 and 72 hpf, respectively (

These results indicate that in zebrafish embryos the toxicity of ZO essential oil appears to be concentration- and time-dependent manner. These results are in line with studies of other plants in the Zingiberaceae family, including the essential oil of 
 <italic>Zingiber cassumunar</italic> Roxb. and the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> Linn., in which embryotoxicity of zebrafish embryo was also observed to be concentration- and time-dependent manners [

Additionally, since zerumbone was found to be a major compound of ZO essential oil in this study, it could be responsible for the embryotoxic and teratogenic effects on zebrafish. Moreover, sabinene and terpinen4-ol found in ZO essential oil could also be responsible for these effects since they were also found to be the major compounds of cassumunar ginger oil that also possessed embryotoxic and teratogenic effects [
