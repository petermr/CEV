<p>Various plants have been shown to possess significant pharmacological activity and to provide many health benefits, both in preclinical studies (in vitro and in vivo models) and in clinical studies in humans [

Presently, the use of medicinal plants is increasing as their natural compounds are believed to be safer than modern medicines. However, the toxicological profiles of most medicinal plants have not been completely determined. Many plant-derived treatments may result in harmful effects in humans, including carcinogenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic effects [

Toxicity testing in a diverse range of in vitro studies using animal models is crucial and includes experimental screening methods for determining the safety profile of medicinal plants. For example, acute oral toxicity test in rodents is widely used to evaluate acute toxicity of a drug or an herb. These tests can include evaluation of the LD

However, using these animals to study consumes time and expense. Thus, there is an effort to find an alternative animal model for the toxicity study of medicinal plants in embryonic development.
