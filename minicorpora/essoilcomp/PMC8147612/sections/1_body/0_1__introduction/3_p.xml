In Malay traditional medicine, midwives in Perak commonly make the poultice from leaves and rhizomes of ZO before applying it to the body of the confinementâ€™s women for postpartum care. ZO leaves are also used as the poultice for lumbago [

In Thai traditional medicine, ZO rhizomes are used to treat gastrointestinal diseases (peptic ulcers and stomachache), constipation, myalgia, sprain, bruising/contusion, and wounds. Moreover, essential oil from ZO rhizomes has been used as a topical agent for Thai traditional massage. Although various pharmacological activities including antidiabetic, anticancer, and antimicrobial activities of ZO have been reported [

 <xref rid="B17-toxics-09-00102" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, the reports about phytochemical characteristics of essential oil of ZO rhizomes found in Thailand and its toxicological profiles including embryotoxicity, teratogenicity, and acute oral toxicity in animal models are still lacking. Thus, the present study aimed to identify the phytochemical profile of ZO essential oil from ZO grown in Thailand and evaluate its toxicity in in vivo models using both zebrafish embryos and rats. These findings of this study are intended to provide part of the data necessary to confirm the safety of new products developed using ZO essential oil in the future.
