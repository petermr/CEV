<p>The essential oil of 
 <italic>Zingiber ottensii</italic> (ZO) Valeton contains terpene compounds, of which zerumbone is a major constituent. The embryotoxicity of ZO essential oil in zebrafish appears to be in a concentration- and time-dependent manner and to have a moderate LC
 <sub>50</sub> (1.003 Âµg/kg). Teratogenic effects of ZO essential oil on zebrafish embryos include morphological defects, reduced hatchability, and decreased heart rate. In the acute oral toxicity study in rats, temporary changes in general conditions including sedation, lethargy, and ataxia seem to be found, but percent body weight gain, water and food consumption, and organ characteristics were unchanged, and there were no deaths of any rats. These preclinical study results provide crucial support for the safety profile of ZO essential oil, an initial step in drug and natural pharmaceutical development. However, further long-term toxicity studies are needed to confirm the safety of any newly developed products containing ZO essential oil.
