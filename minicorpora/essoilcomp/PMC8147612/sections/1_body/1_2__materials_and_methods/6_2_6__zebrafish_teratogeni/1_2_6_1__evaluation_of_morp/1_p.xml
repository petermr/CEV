<p>The teratogenicity of the zebrafish was evaluated both in embryos and in larvae after five days (120 hpf) exposure to five different concentrations of ZO essential oil by observing morphological changes and developmental abnormalities. After treatment, the embryos and larvae were examined every 24 h using a stereomicroscope. Embryonic and larval morphology was determined according to OECD Test Guideline 236 [
 <xref rid="B18-toxics-09-00102" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and the normal development of the embryos and larvae was compared using the method of Kimmel et al. (1995) [
 <xref rid="B7-toxics-09-00102" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], as previously described. Examples of teratogenicity identified included deformities in somite otolith and eyes, failure of tail detachment, absence of heartbeat or blood circulation, yolk sac or pericardial edema, yolk sac malabsorption, and skeletal malformation and delayed hatching [

The malformed embryos and larvae were captured with an Olympus digital camera (OM-D E-M10 Mark III), and the teratogenicity was evaluated by the percentage of embryos or larvae with abnormalities to the number remaining of normal embryos, as previously described [
