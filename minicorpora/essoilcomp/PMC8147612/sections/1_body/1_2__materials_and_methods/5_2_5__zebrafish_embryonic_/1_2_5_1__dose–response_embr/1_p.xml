<p>Embryotoxicity in the zebrafish was assessed by measuring the mortality rate of the zebrafish embryos. Exposure of the zebrafish embryos to the extract was performed according to the method described in OECD 236 [
 <xref rid="B18-toxics-09-00102" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. At 6 hpf, healthy zebrafish embryos were selected for subsequent experiments. Overall, 20 fertilized eggs for each concentration treatment were transferred to individual wells of 24-well plates. The embryos were exposed to various concentrations of ZO essential oil containing 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) diluted in 2 mL of embryo water. It was serially diluted via twofold serial dilution to produce five different concentrations of ZO essential oil (3.91, 1.95, 0.98, 0.49, and 0.24 Âµg/mL). The control (untreated) group was exposed to 2 mL of embryo water containing only 0.1% DMSO. The experiment was duplicated, each performed with three independent replicates. The embryos were observed under a stereomicroscope every 24 h. Death of an embryo was indicated by coagulation and/or absence of a heartbeat. The number of dead embryos in each concentration at 96 hpf was recorded, and the mortality rate was calculated. The GraphPad Prism8 [log (inhibitor) vs. normalized response-variable slope nonlinear model] was used to calculate the 50% lethal concentration (LC
