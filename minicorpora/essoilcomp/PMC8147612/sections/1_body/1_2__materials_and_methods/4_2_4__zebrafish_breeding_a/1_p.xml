<p>The evening of the day before breeding the healthy and active adult male and female wild-type zebrafish (ratio 1:2) with high ability to produce fertilized eggs were selected for spawning and were moved to a spawning tank equipped with 5 L of filtered tap water and fitted with spawning enhancers consisting of marbles and a spawn trap. Mating occurred the next morning within 30–60 min after the lights were turned on. The zebrafish were then removed from the spawning tank and placed back into their resting glass tank. Spawning enhancers were removed from the spawning tank. Water was poured out slowly from one corner of the spawning tank, and the fertilized eggs were collected with a plastic pipette and transferred to clean Petri dishes containing embryo water prepared with minor modifications of the previously reported protocol [

Fertilized embryos were kept at 26.5 °C and allowed to develop for 6 h postfertilization (hpf). Microscopic observation was accomplished using a stereomicroscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) to observe embryo development prior to treatment [
