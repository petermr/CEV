<p>Wild-type zebrafish (
 <italic>Danio rerio</italic>) were purchased from a local ornamental fish shop, that normally supplies zebrafish used for studying in the aquatic laboratory of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand. Maintenance of zebrafish was in accordance with the internationally accepted guideline (OECD 236) [
 <xref rid="B18-toxics-09-00102" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], with minor modifications. Adult zebrafish were maintained in an 80 L glass tank with a maximum density of 1 g fish/L filtered tap water (pH 6.9–7.4, 26 ± 1 °C) with a 14:10 h of the light–dark cycle in the Aquatic Medicine Room located of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Chiang Mai University. The zebrafish were fed twice a day: frozen brine shrimps (
 <italic>Artemia</italic>) in the morning and commercial dry flake food in the afternoon. Water was changed and feces removed from each tank daily. Water parameters, including temperature, pH, nitrite, nitrate, and ammonia content, were also monitored daily. All zebrafish were quarantined for at least 3 months before using them in the experiments. They were selected and graded into many groups depending on health status and fertility. Only zebrafish with the best quality were selected to be used as the breeders. These zebrafish were acclimatized for 4 weeks before initial breeding. All experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Thailand (Permit No. R8/2563, 17 July 2020).
