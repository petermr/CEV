 <xref rid="B25-toxics-09-00102" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The female rats used in the experiment were randomly selected and marked on the tail for individual identification. A single high dose of 2000 mg/kg of ZO essential oil was administered by oral gavage to one rat following 12 h of fasting. 48 h later, the same dose was administered to another four rats, for a total of five treated rats. The negative control group of five rats was treated in parallel with the vehicle (0.9% saline). Food was provided to all rats approximately 1 h after administration.
