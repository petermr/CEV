<p>After 14 days, all the rats were sacrificed, and their vital organs, including heart, kidneys, liver, lung, and spleen were removed, weighed, and microscopically examined. All vital organs isolated from each rat were fixed in 10% buffered formalin before being subjected to further histopathological evaluation. The relative organ weight of each animal was calculated as follows: 
 <disp-formula>Relative organ weight = organ weight (g)/body weight of the rat (g) Ã— 100</disp-formula>
