<p>One kg of ZO fresh rhizomes and 1 L of distilled water were used to obtain ZO essential oil by hydrodistillation extraction using a Clevenger apparatus over a period of 3 h. The ZO essential oil was then collected and stored in an airtight dark bottle at 4 °C until use. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) was used to identify the chemical components found in ZO essential oil. The system was comprised of a 7890A gas chromatograph (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a 5975C mass-selective detector (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) using a DB5-MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 µm film thickness). The ionization energy was 70 eV and the ion source temperature was 230 °C. The oven temperature was initially set at 50 °C, then slowly raised to 220 °C over a period of 45 min (4 °C/min) with helium as the carrier gas. The flow rate of the carrier gas was set at 1 mL/min using a split mode (split ratio 500:1). The injection temperature was 250 °C, and the detector temperature was 280 °C. Identification of the ZO essential oil components was based on the comparison of their retention times and their mass spectra by matching with standard reference database and library, which included NIST Mass Spectral Database (2008) and W8N08 library (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., Hoboken, NJ, USA). Each component’s percentage was calculated based on the total area of all peaks obtained from the ZO essential oil.</p>
