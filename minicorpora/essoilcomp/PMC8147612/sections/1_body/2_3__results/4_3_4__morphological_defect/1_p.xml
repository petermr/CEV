<p>Determination of teratogenicity was performed using five different concentrations of ZO essential oil (3.91, 1.95, 0.98, 0.49, and 0.24 µg/mL) and 0.1% DMSO (control) at various time points over the period 24–120 hpf (

 <xref rid="toxics-09-00102-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The results showed no teratogenic abnormalities in the control group of zebrafish embryos or in the group treated with 0.24 µg/mL of ZO essential oil (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxics-09-00102-f004">Figure 4</xref>E,F). However, all embryos and larvae were found to express morphological abnormalities when 3.91, 1.95, and 0.98 µg/mL of ZO essential oil were present at 48, 72, and 96 hpf, respectively (
 <xref rid="toxics-09-00102-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Notably, zebrafish embryo’s accumulative abnormalities were found in the groups treated with 0.49–3.91 µg/mL of ZO essential oil. Morphological defects included pericardial sac edema, coagulation, dented tail, poor reabsorption of the yolk sac, malformation of the yolk sac, and spinal curvature (
