<p>Embryotoxicity was evaluated at five different concentrations of ZO essential oil (3.91, 1.95, 0.98, 0.49, and 0.24 µg/mL). Coagulation and the absence of heartbeat in zebrafish embryos were indicative of mortality [

No viable zebrafish embryos were observed in the groups treated with 1.95 and 3.91 µg/mL ZO essential oil. The LC
 <sub>50</sub> value of ZO essential oil was 1.003 µg/mL.
