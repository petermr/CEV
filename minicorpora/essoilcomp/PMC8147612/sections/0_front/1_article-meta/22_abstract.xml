  <italic>Zingiber ottensii</italic> Valeton (ZO) exhibits pharmacological activity and has long been used in traditional medicine. However, reports about its safety profiles are limited. The present study aimed to evaluate the phytochemical profile and the toxic effects of ZO essential oil on the development of zebrafish and acute oral toxicity in rats. The essential oil was isolated from ZO rhizomes, and phytochemicals were analyzed using a gas chromatography–mass spectrometer (GC–MS). The embryotoxic and teratogenic effects of ZO essential oil were evaluated in zebrafish embryos and larvae and the acute oral toxicity was determined in rats. GC–MS results showed the essential oil contained zerumbone as a major phytoconstituent (24.73%). The zebrafish embryotoxicity of ZO essential oil appeared to be concentration- and time-dependent manner, with a moderate LC
  <sub>50</sub> (1.003 µg/mL). Teratogenicity in zebrafish embryos also included morphological defects, decreased hatchability, and reduced heart rate. In rats, ZO essential oil (2000 mg/kg, p.o.) resulted in no mortality or significant toxicities. These findings suggest that ZO has embryotoxic and teratogenic effects in zebrafish embryos but does not result in death or acute oral toxicity in rats. Further long-term toxicity studies are needed to confirm the safety of products developed from ZO essential oil.
