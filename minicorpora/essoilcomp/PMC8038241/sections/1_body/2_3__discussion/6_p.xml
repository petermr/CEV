<p>Any effects over K
 <sup>+</sup> need to be understood to understand the EOâ€™s mechanism of action, since this ion contributes to the membrane potential in excitable cells, especially neurons, skeletal muscle fiber and smooth muscle fiber, through their action on their channels. On the other hand, EODa effects on serotonin-induced contractions may occur through an external agonist mechanism, where the EODa may bind to membrane receptors and modify the activity of ion channels such as Na
 <sup>+</sup> and K

 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-02041" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This mechanism begins with the coupling of serotonin to the Gq/11 protein receptor, activating phospholipase C (PLC), which hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP
 <sub>2</sub>) into inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP
 <sub>3</sub>) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP
 <sub>3</sub> diffuses into the cytoplasm and binds to inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP
 <sub>3</sub>R receptors), these being calcium channels present in the SR membrane, which when activated release Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>. Meanwhile DAG together with Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> activate PKC that acts in several processes including the regulation of transmembrane Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> transport [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-26-02041" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The observed relaxation may be due, in part, to a blockage of IP
 <sub>3</sub>R activation by IP
 <sub>3</sub>, as observed in Pelaia et al., [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-26-02041" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and by other mechanisms such as: increased Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>-ATPase activity, decreased IP
 <sub>3</sub> formation, protein kinase A (PKA) activity and stimulation of the Na
 <sup>+</sup>/Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> exchanger.
