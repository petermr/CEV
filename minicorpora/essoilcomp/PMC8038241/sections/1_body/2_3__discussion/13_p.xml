<p>The lethal effect of terpenes and/or essential oils is the result of the toxic action of these compounds on various receptor targets, especially in signaling or regulatory pathways that are directly associated with the nervous system, such as: acetylcholinesterase interference, binding to oxytocin, nicotinic, GABAergic and tyramine receptors [

In addition to numerous target effects, where these substances do not act on a single target, the complex composition of essential oils contribute to the lethality of insects, not only because of their pharmacodynamic effect, but also because of the possibility of activating on several targets, and pharmacokinetic effects [
