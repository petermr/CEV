<p>Pereira-de-Morais et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-02041" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] demonstrated that the EODa relaxed the smooth muscle of isolated rat tracheas, with the data indicating that this effect is supposedly due to the blockage of 
 <sc>l</sc>-type calcium channels. Similarly, Menezes et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-26-02041" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] reported a relaxant effect for the 
 <italic>Lippia origanoide</italic> essential oil against contractions promoted by KCL, whilst also indicating the involvement of KCa and KV potassium channels in smooth muscle relaxation, a fact that may explain the relaxation promoted by the EODa since both of these have the same compounds at greater quantities in their composition.
