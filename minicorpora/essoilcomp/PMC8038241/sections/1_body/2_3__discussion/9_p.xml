<p>The toxic action of the 
 <italic>D. ambrosioides</italic> essential oil has also been investigated in other important models, with studies reporting that this species has pesticidal, larvicidal and insecticidal activity. The 
 <italic>D. ambrosioides</italic> essential oil presented a remarkable in vitro schistosomicidal action, killing 100% of the adult worms in 24 and 72 h, and significantly reducing in vitro cell viability, obtaining however, a selectivity index 31.8 times more toxic to adult 
 <italic>Schistossoma mansoni</italic> worms than the tested cells [
