<p>The constituent variations in the aforementioned analyses may be explained by the numerous variables present when comparing studies using the same plant species that have been grown and collected from different locations. These variables include the type of soil, pluviosity indices, wind intensity, collection time and collection season, among other factors that are important influencers in the constitution of essential oils, where such differences have been previously reported [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-02041" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Another factor that must be taken into account is the maturation or age of the plant, which can alter the essential oil composition [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-02041" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Changes in composition can also be observed by chemical reactions that may occur spontaneously following EO extraction, such as by the self-oxidation of Î±-terpinene, increasing the concentration of several other constituents such as ascaridol and thus reducing its own concentration when in contact with the air [
