<p>Fruit fly exposure by fumigation to the 
 <italic>Dysphania ambrosioides</italic> essential oil caused a significant increase in mortality. This effect depends on the exposure time and the oil concentration. In the study by Pinho et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-26-02041" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], the 
 <italic>Psidium guajava</italic> essential oil presented significant action in terms of 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> mortality, where additionally, the tested concentrations caused a total loss of motor capacity in the flies, depending on the dose and time of exposure. These findings corroborate with the present study and suggest that aromatic plant essential oils may be toxic to arthropods.
