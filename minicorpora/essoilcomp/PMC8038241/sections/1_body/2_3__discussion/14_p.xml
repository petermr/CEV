<p>It has been suggested that the reduced mobility of 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, observed by the lower number of flies reaching the top of the column, is a result of the effective inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) [

Thus, we may infer the EOâ€™s ability to induce relaxation in smooth muscle may be explained by an increased concentration of acetylcholine in the vascular endothelium. Acetylcholine in the endothelium acts through muscarinic receptors coupled to G proteins, which contrary to stimulating calcium influx for an effective contraction, induces the activation of nitric oxide synthase promoting the production of nitric oxide and relaxation [

 <xref rid="B55-molecules-26-02041" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. However, it is noteworthy that other pathways causing changes in the mobility of flies may be involved, including the dopaminergic pathway, since decreases in dopamine significantly alter insect mobility [
