<p>The α-terpinene was one of the main compounds identified in the 
 <italic>D. ambrosioides</italic> essential oil, also known as 
 <italic>Chenopodium ambrosioides</italic>, which showed acaricidal activity [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-26-02041" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Moreover, α-terpinene has shown an acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-26-02041" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], thus corroborating with the findings in this study, since α-terpinene is the main monoterpene of present in the EODa.
