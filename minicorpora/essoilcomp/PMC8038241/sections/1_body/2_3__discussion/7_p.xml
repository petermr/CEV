<p>Studies with essential oils from aromatic medicinal plants such as 
 <italic>Melissa officinalis</italic> and 
 <italic>Lippia alba</italic> have shown inhibition of contractions promoted by K
 <sup>+</sup> and 5-HT (electromechanical and pharmacomechanical pathways) in several organs from rats such as: ileum, trachea, aorta and uterus [
