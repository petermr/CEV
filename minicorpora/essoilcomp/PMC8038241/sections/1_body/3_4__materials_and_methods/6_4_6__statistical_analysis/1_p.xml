<p>Data are expressed as the mean ±S.E.M. For statistical analysis and graph production, the Sigma Plot 11.0 software was used for the ex vivo assays using a one-way ANOVA followed by Holm-Sidak, and the GraphPad Prism 7.0 software for the other tests. Results considered statistically significant obtained a null hypothesis probability of less than 5% (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Student’s 
 <italic>t</italic>-tests and analysis of variance (two-way ANOVA), followed by Tukey’s 
 <italic>t</italic>-test were used. For calculating the EC
 <sub>50</sub> values, logarithmic interpolation and sigmoidal regression were performed, with the concentration capable of producing 50% of the maximum effect being considered as the EC
 <sub>50</sub>, with the calculations being performed for each experiment.
