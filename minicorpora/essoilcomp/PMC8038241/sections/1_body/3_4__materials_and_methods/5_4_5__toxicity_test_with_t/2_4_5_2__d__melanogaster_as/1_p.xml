<p>Fly exposure to the essential oil was performed using the fumigation protocol as described: 20 adult flies (male and female) were placed in 130 cm
 <sup>3</sup> flasks, containing a filter paper soaked with 20% sucrose in distilled water at the bottom. A filter paper (1 cm
 <sup>2</sup>) was attached to the inside of the bottle’s screw cap to apply different doses of the essential oil. In doing so, the flies feed on the sucrose solution at the bottom of the flasks while the essential oil is allowed to volatilize from the top and reached the fly’s respiratory system. The bottles received the following treatments: 1% sucrose (control) and 1, 2 or 4 μg/mL of the essential oil or the tested constituent. Fly survival readings were taken every hour until the eighth hour. The results are shown as the number of live flies (mean ± SD) obtained from six independent experiments.
