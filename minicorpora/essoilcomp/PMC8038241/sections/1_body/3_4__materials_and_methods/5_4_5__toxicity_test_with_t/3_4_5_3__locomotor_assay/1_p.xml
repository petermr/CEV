<p>Locomotor capacity was evaluated following the negative geotaxis behavior as described by S. Boutkhil et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-02041" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], with some modifications. Twenty adult flies (1–4 days old, males and females) were exposed to the essential oil as described in the previous section. Briefly, after the hourly fly mortality count, a negative geotaxis test was performed simultaneously with the surviving flies, where this consisted of counting the number of flies that rise above 5 cm in the glass column of the experiment itself, during a 5 s time interval. The tests were repeated five times with 1 min intervals. The results are presented as the number of flies that reached the top ± SD obtained from three independent experiments.
