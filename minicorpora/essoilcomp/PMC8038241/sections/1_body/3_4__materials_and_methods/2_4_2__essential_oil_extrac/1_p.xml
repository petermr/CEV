<p>The leaves from the plants were collected and cut into approximately 1 cm
 <sup>2</sup> pieces. Subsequently, the plant material was immersed in distilled water and subjected to extraction by hydrodistillation in a Clevenger type apparatus to obtain the essential oil. The extractions were performed in triplicates and treated with anhydrous sodium sulfate. The oil was then filtered through cotton and transferred with a Pasteur pipette to an amber glass and stored at −20 °C. The extraction and analysis procedures were performed at the Natural Products Research Laboratory (Laboratório de Pesquisa de Produtos Naturais—LPPN)-Regional University of Cariri (Universidade Regional do Cariri—URCA, Crato, Brazil).
