<p>The 
 <italic>Sus scrofa domesticus</italic> coronary artery ex vivo muscle contractility methodology has shown the relaxant activity of both the EODa and its major compound on smooth muscle contractions induced by potassium and serotonin. The EODa composition revealed the presence of oxygenated terpenes, which are capable of promoting toxic effects in insects from a low concentration, in addition to inducing a precocious impairment in fly mobility, which creates a difficulty in dispersing these insects. The above makes the EODa a potential product for carrying out necessary studies on the safety of these compounds for humans, both for its myorelaxant action on the vascular system, and its toxicity for cultivating crops, with the possibility of developing formulations with more effective, safe and attractive cost benefits.
