 <italic>Dysphania ambrosioides</italic> (L.), Mosyakin and Clemants (Chenopodiaceae), also known as 
 <italic>Chenopodium ambrosioides</italic>, occurs frequently in subtropical and subtemperate regions with a cosmopolitan characteristic, and is popularly used for the treatment of worms [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-02041" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], as a diuretic and in respiratory and inflammatory alterations. According to the world health organization [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-26-02041" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], 
 <italic>D. ambrosioides</italic> is one of the most commonly used medicinal plants in the world, this being due to its wide distribution and ethnomedical knowledge. The 
 <italic>D. ambrosioides</italic> EO has previously been reported in the literature with insecticidal activity against bees and houseflies [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-26-02041" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], as an antiviral, anthelmintic, antifungal antileishmanial and antioxidant. The EO possesses components with known medicinal value such as: ascaridol, isoascaridol, p-cymene, limonene and α-terpinene. Bioactive products isolated from plants are used for the treatment of tuberculosis, rheumatism, uterine hemorrhaging and respiratory diseases [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-26-02041" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Studies have demonstrated α-terpinene as safe in embryo-fetotoxicity tests in rats [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-26-02041" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], however, other studies have revealed some toxic effects in the oral use of this substance [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-26-02041" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-02041" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, among the concerns for the development of new products with biological and/or pharmacological activity is the determination of toxic doses and safety margins. Several studies demonstrate anatomical and physiological similarities between the cardiovascular system of humans and pigs (
 <italic>Sus scrofa domesticus</italic>), in particular the control of smooth muscle, with effects involving electromechanical and pharmacomechanical mechanisms being reported [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-02041" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-02041" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-02041" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-26-02041" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The myorelaxant effect that drugs and medications have on vascular smooth muscle is a fundamental tool in the control of conditions in which vasoconstriction or vascular obstruction are responsible for damage to tissues, organs, systems or even the survival of the organism. Therefore, tests with swine coronary arteries yield relevant information on the subject, as some studies have already demonstrated the myorelaxant action of extracts, essential oils and their components [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-02041" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-02041" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-02041" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-02041" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-02041" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-02041" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-02041" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Thus, smooth muscle effects, particularly in coronary arteries, provide important information, which may generate enormous possibilities for other studies involving the action and mechanisms of contraction of smooth muscle. This study aimed to evaluate the myorelaxant activity of the 
 <italic>Dysphania ambrosioides</italic> essential oil (EODa) in an ex vivo 
 <italic>Sus scrofa domesticus</italic> coronary model, as well as to verify the toxic concentrations of the EODa and its major constituent, α-terpinene, against the 
 <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> alternative model.
