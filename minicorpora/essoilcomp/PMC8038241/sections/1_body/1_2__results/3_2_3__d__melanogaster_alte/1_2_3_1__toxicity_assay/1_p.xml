<p>The toxicity tests for the 
 <italic>Dysphania ambrosioides</italic> essential oil and α-terpinene against 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> were performed with three concentrations (1, 2 and 4 mg/mL) using the fumigation method. This test uses flies as an alternative model to the use of mammals, generating information for the determination of the toxicity profile of the essential oil and the compound. The calculation for the average lethal concentration (LC
 <sub>50</sub>) of the EODa was determined as 1.806 mg/mL, by sigmoidal regression, whereas for α-terpinene an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 2.282 was obtained. The aforementioned results were similar to those observed by [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-02041" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], where the EODa obtained an LC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.96 mg/mL, this being lower than the isolated constituent (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02041-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The same methodology was used to determine the EC
 <sub>50</sub> for mobility, for which a value of 1.646 mg/mL was obtained.
