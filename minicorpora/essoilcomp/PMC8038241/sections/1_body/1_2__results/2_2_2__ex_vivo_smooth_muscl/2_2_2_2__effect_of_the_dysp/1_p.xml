<p>Increasing and cumulative concentrations of the EODa (1, 3, 10, 30, 100, 300, 600 and 1000 μg/mL) were administered to evaluate its myorelaxant effect on 5-TH-induced contractions in swine smooth muscle coronary arteries (pharmacomechanical coupling). Increasing concentrations of the EODa promoted a concentration-dependent relaxation that was statistically significant from the 30 µg/mL concentration (
