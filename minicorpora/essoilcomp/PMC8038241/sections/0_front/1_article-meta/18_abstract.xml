 <p>Purpose: Alternative methods for the use of animals in research have gained increasing importance, due to assessments evaluating the real need for their use and the development of legislation that regulates the subject. The principle of the 3R’s (replacement, reduction and refinement) has been an important reference, such that in vitro, ex vivo and cord replacement methods have achieved a prominent place in research. Methods: Therefore, due to successful results from studies developed with these methods, the present study aimed to evaluate the myorelaxant effect of the 
  <italic>Dysphania ambrosioides</italic> essential oil (EODa) using a 
  <italic>Sus scrofa domesticus</italic> coronary artery model, and the toxicity of both the 
  <italic>Dysphania ambrosioides</italic> essential oil and its major constituent, α-terpinene, against 
  <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> in toxicity and negative geotaxis assays. Results: The EODa relaxed the smooth muscle of swine coronary arteries precontracted with K
  <sup>+</sup> and 5-HT in assays using 
  <italic>Sus scrofa domesticus</italic> coronary arteries. The toxicity results presented LC
  <sub>50</sub> values of 1.546 mg/mL and 2.282 mg/mL for the EODa and α-terpinene, respectively, thus showing the EODa and α-terpinene presented toxicity to these dipterans, with the EODa being more toxic. Conclusions: Moreover, the results reveal the possibility of using the EODa in vascular disease studies since it promoted the relaxation of the Sus scrofa domesticus coronary smooth muscle.
