 <p>In the present work, essential oil and fatty acids and extracts obtained from aerial parts of 
  <italic>Phlomis linearis</italic> Boiss. &amp; Bal. were investigated for chemical composition and biological activities. The phytochemical analyses were conducted with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/flame ionisation detector (GC-MS/FID) and liquid chromatography-mass spectromtetry (LC-MS/MS) techniques. The extracts and essential oil were studied for 
  <italic>α</italic>-amylase and acetylcholinesterase activities with two different spectrophotometric methods. Antimicrobial activities of the extracts were investigated by microdilution. The extracts were evaluated 
  <italic>in vitro</italic> for cytotoxic effects against cancer and normal cell lines by MTT assay. The essential oil (EO) contained 
  <italic>α</italic>-pinene (12.5%) and 
  <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene (10.7%) as main compounds. Palmitic
  <italic> </italic>(26.5%) and nonadecanoic acids (26.6%) were determined as fatty acids. Phytochemical analysis of the extracts found phenolic acids, phlinosides, verbascoside, and flavonoids. The extracts and essential oil demonstrated poor 
  <italic>α</italic>-amylase inhibitory activity. The best acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity was obtained for diethly ether extract of 
  <italic>P. linearis</italic> (67.2 ± 3.4%) at 10 mg /mL concentration. Ethyl acetate extract found to be effective against 
  <italic>Staphlococcus aureus</italic> at a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 156.26 µg/mL. Diethyl ether extract of 
  <italic>P. linearis </italic>was active on A549 cell lines with an IC
  <sub>50</sub> = 316 ± 4.16 µg/mL when compared with cisplatin IC
  <sub>50</sub> = 24.43 ± 0.14 µg/mL. To the best of our knowledge, the present work is the first comprehensive report on anti-acetylcholinesterase, anti-α-amylase, and antimicrobial activities, as well as cytotoxic effects of 
  <italic>P. linearis</italic>.
