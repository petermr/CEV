<p>After serial dilution of samples in 96 well, each microorganism suspension was pipetted into each well and incubated at 35 °C for 24 h. Positive growth controls (to assess the presence of turbidity) were performed in wells not containing antimicrobial agents. Microbial growth was observed by adding 20 µL of resazurin of 0.01% with minor modifications of CLSI standards. The experiment was done in triplicate and calculated the mean of MIC.</p>
