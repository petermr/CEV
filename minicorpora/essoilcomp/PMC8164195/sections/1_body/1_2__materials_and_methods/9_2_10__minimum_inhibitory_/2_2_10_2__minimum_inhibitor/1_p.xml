<p>Antimicrobial activity performed for different extracts of 
 <italic>P. linearis. </italic>The extracts were prepared within DMSO, and the standard antimicrobial powders were obtained from Sanovel Pharmaceutical Industry (İstanbul, Turkey). Ampicillin, cefuroxime, and fluconazole were used as reference drugs. The MIC values of the strains were evaluated with a slight modification of microdilution methods [29­–30]. The extracts were diluted 2-fold initially with a final concentration range of 2500 to 19.53 µg/mL. Ampicillin, cefuroxime, and fluconazole prepared at 64–0.125 µg/mL within DMSO and water. Bacterial suspensions were grown overnight in double strength broth and standardized to 10
 <sup>5</sup> CFU/mL for bacteria. 
 <italic>Candida</italic> suspensions were standardized using a turbidimeter (McFarland densitometer, Biosan, Latvia, 0.5 density) to 5 x 10
 <sup>3</sup> CFU per well in RPMI medium under sterile conditions. 10 μL yeast inoculum was added to each well of the microplates.
