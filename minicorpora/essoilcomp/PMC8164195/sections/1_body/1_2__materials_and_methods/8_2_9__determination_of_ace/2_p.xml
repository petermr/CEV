<p>A total of 25 µL of the sample, 50 µL of buffer, and 25 µL of AChE (0.22 U/mL) solution added into the 96 well (flat-bottom) plates and incubated for at 25 °C for 15 min. After that, 125 µL of Ellman’s reagent DTNB (5,5-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (3.0 mM) and 25 µL of substrate ATCI (15 mM) were added. The mixture was programmed to stand at 25 °C for 15 min and read at 412 nm by a microplate reader (Biotek Powerwave XS, USA). Galanthamine solution was prepared at a concentration of 0.6 mg/mL and used as a positive control. Similarly, a blank control was prepared by adding the sample solution to all reaction reagents and added 25 µL of the buffer instead of the enzyme. The control wells contained all the reagents without the sample. The percentage of inhibition was calculated according to Equation (1). The mean standard error (± SEM) was used for evaluation of the data.</p>
