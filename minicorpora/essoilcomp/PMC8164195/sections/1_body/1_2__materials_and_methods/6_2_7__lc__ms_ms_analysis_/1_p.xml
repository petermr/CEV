<p>LC-MS/MS analyses of extracts were carried out using the Applied Biosystems 3200 Q-Trap LC- MS/MS (Antes, İstanbul, Turkey) system equipped with an ESI source operating in negative ion mode. For the chromatographic separation, a GL Science Intersil ODS (Tokyo, Japan) 250 × 4.6 mm, i.d., 5 µm particle size, octadecyl silica gel analytical column operating at 40 °C was used. The solvent flow rate was maintained at 0.5 mL/min. Detection was carried out with PDA detector. The elution gradient consisted of mobile phases (A) acetonitrile:water:formic acid (10:89:1,v/v/v), and (B) acetonitrile:water:formic acid (89:10:1, v/v/v), respectively. The amount of B was increased from 10% to 100% in 40 min. LC-ESI-MS/MS data were collected, and processed by Analyst 1.6 software [25­–26]. </p>
