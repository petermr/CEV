<p>The antidiabetic potential of 
 <italic>P. linearis</italic> extracts and EO was determined upon inhibition of the 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase enzyme that is involved in hydrocarbon’s metabolism. The iodine/potassium iodide (I/KI) method was used [27]. The concentration of samples was prepared with MeOH at 10 mg/mL, and the enzyme was prepared with 0.8 U/mL in 20 mM in sodium phosphate buffer pH (6.9). The control wells contained all the reagents without the sample (the solvents of the samples instead were added). Acarbose (inhibitor of α-amylase) prepared in concentration of 0.25 mg/mL was used as the positive control. The percentage of inhibition was calculated according to Equation (1):
