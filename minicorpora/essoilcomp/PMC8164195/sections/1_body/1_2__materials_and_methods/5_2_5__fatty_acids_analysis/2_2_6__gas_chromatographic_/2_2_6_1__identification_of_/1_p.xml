 </fn>. In addition, identification of compounds was confirmed by comparison of their RRI values with data reported for polar column. The relative percentage amounts of the separated compounds were determined from FID chromatograms. Confirmation was done using the in-house “Başer Library of Essential Oil Constituents” database, analysed with known pure compounds by chromatographic runs at the same conditions.
