<p>The lipid extraction kit is used for the extraction of the total lipids from 
 <italic>P. linearis.</italic> According to protocol, 0.15 g mill-ground plant material was treated with a 3 mL solvent containing chloroform/MeOH (2:1). After homogenising and vortexing of mixture, 0.5 mL of an aqueous buffer of the kit was added, and the sample was mixed by a vortex again. Subsequently, the extraction solution was poured into a syringe system containing a filter. The eluted solvent contained the chloroform phase with total lipids. Then, 200 mL of aliquot of the total lipids dried under a stream of nitrogen for subsequent transesterification. After drying, 1 mL of BF
 <sub>3</sub>-MeOH solution and 0.3 mL of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane were added. The mixture was heated at 95°C for 1 h under reflux. Then, 1 mL of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane and 1 mL of distilled water were added. The mixture was vortexed and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min. The top hexane layer was transferred into a vial and then injected into the GC-MS and GC-FID system without solvent evaporation before injection.
