<p>Human lung epithelial cell line (A549, ATCC CCL-185), human colon cancer cell line (HT-29, ATCC® HTB-38), and mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line (NIH/3T3, ATCC CRL-1658) were used for determining IC
 <sub>50</sub> of the extracts by MTT method according to previous studies [31–33]. Stock solutions of the extracts were prepared in ethanol. The tested extracts were added to the wells (1000–7.8125 µg/mL) in quadruplicates. Inhibition % was calculated for the extracts. Nonlinear regression analysis was used for IC
 <sub>50</sub> values. Calculations on the results were performed according to Equation (2):
