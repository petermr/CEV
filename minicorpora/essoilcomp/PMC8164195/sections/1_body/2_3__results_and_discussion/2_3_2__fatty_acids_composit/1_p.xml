<p>The total lipids of 
 <italic>P. linearis</italic> were obtained with microextraction technique with subsequent transesterification of fatty acids. Gas-chromatographic analysis gave nine compounds representing 97.4% of fatty acids (Table 2). The fatty acids fraction of 
 <italic>P. linearis</italic> was characterised with abundance of saturated fatty acids. Namely, palmitic (26.5%), nonadecanoic (26.5%), and stearic (10.6%) acids were found as major fatty acids. In literature, there are several reports about fatty acid composition of 
 <italic>Phlomis</italic> species. Namely, 
 <italic>P. bracteosa</italic> Royle ex Benth. was characterised with octadecadienoic (6.8%), elaidic (4.4%), pentadecanoic (3.8%), and stearic (1.9%) acids [44]. Palmitic (33.1%, 27.4%, 27.8%), 
 <italic>Î±</italic>-linolenic (23.1%, 24.4%, 24.6%), and oleic (10.5%, 23.7%, 14.4%) acids have been reported for 
 <italic>P. armeniaca </italic>Willd.,
 <italic> P. nissolii </italic>L., and
 <italic> P. pungens </italic>var.
 <italic> pungens </italic>Willd., respectively [45]. Hexadecanoic acid in 
 <italic>P. herba-venti </italic>L. leaves (12.9%) and flowers (33.1%) [46], octadecanoic acid in 
 <italic>P. bruguieri</italic> Desf. (56.41%), and 
 <italic>P. olivieri</italic> (44.4%) have been detected [47]. To best of our knowledge, the fatty acid composition of 
 <italic>P. linearis </italic>have not previously been reported. Therefore, the current study is the first report on lipophilic constituents of
 <italic> P. linearis.</italic>
