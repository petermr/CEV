<p>The EO inhibited AChE (39.5 %) at 10 mg/mL concentration. In this report, EOs of 
 <italic>P.</italic>
 <italic>linearis</italic> consist of 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (12.5%) and 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene (10.7%) as major compounds. In a previous research, α-pinene, 1,8-cineole, and camphor were found to be uncompetitive reversible inhibitors of AChE [66]. According to recent study, the EO of 
 <italic>P. kurdica</italic> was also reported for AChE (41.4%) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) (36.2%) inhibitory activity at 250 µg/mL concentration [67]. Additionally, EOs for 
 <italic>Piper</italic> species demonstrated their acetylcholinesterase activities. EOs contain terpenes and phenylpropanoids as predominant compounds like 
 <italic>P. linearis</italic> essential oil. [68]. Therefore, anti-AChE activity of the tested 
 <italic>P. linearis </italic>EOs could be attributed the presence of the predominant compounds. However, it should be noted that essential oils are mixture of many chemical compounds, which may potentially modulate enzyme inhibitions. Therefore, main and minor compounds of the EO may attempt to enzyme inhibitions.
