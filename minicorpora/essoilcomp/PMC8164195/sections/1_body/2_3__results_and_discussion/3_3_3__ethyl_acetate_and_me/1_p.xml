<p>Phenolics acids, flavonoids, and phenylethanoid glycosides were identified for the ethyl acetate and methanol extracts via LC-MS/MS technique. The list of the compounds detected in 
 <italic>P. linearis</italic> ethyl acetate and methanol extract with MS detector is summarised in Table 3. The results of phytochemical analyses of the extracts were examined with 5-caffeoylquinic acid, 3.5/1.5 dicaffeoylquinic acid, phlinosides, verbascoside, quercetin, and luteolin derivatives. Chromatographic profiles EAc and MeOH extracts of 
 <italic>P. linearis</italic> obtained with liquid chromatography were given in Figures 1 and 2.
