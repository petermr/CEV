<p>In this study, phenolics acids, flavonoids, and phenylethanoid glycosides were identified for the EAc and MeOH extracts. These compounds have been reported to have antidiabetic effects [62–64]. Twenty-one flavonoids were investigated for inhibitory activities against α-glucosidase and α-amylase. Luteolin inhibited α-glucosidase (36%, at 0.5 mg/mL) [63]. Six group of flavonoids were reported inhibitory activities against 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase and α-amylase. Among them, luteolin, myrcetin, and quercetin were found as potent inhibitors with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.36, 0.38, and 0.50 mM, respectively against 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase enzyme [64]. Moreover, MeOH extract of 
 <italic>Phlomis stewartii </italic>displayed 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibitory activity (80.2% at 1.0 mg/mL) [65]. The 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase inhibitory capacities of these extracts might be attributed to their phytochemicals contents.
