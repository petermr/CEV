<p>In this study, the extracts and EO of 
 <italic>P. linearis</italic> were evaluated for in vitro 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase activity. As indicated in Table 4, the EO inhibited the enzyme’s activity by 25.7% at concentration of 10 mg/mL. The following order of the extracts against α-amylase activity was observed at 10 mg/mL concentration: 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane (31.5 ± 2.6%), methanol (30.5 ± 1.4), diethyl ether (28.3 ± 4.0%) and ethyl acetate (24.8 ± 2.0%). It should be noted that acarbose displayed more potent inhibition of α-amylase (57.2%, concentration at 0.25 mg/mL) than all tested extracts and EO.
