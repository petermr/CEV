<p>Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder and characterised by hyperglycemia. α-amylase is a key enzyme that hydrolysis carbohydrates to disaccharides, and α-glucosidases hydrolysis disaccharides to monosaccharides like glucose. Therefore, inhibition of these enzyme systems helps to control hyperglycemia and digestion of carbohydrates to reduce blood glucose levels [60–61].</p>
