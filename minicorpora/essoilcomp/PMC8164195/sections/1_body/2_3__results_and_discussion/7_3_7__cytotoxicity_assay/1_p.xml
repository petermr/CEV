<p>MTT test was evaluated to see cytotoxic activity of the extracts of 
 <italic>P. linearis</italic> against A549 and HT-29 cancer cell lines. Also, the cytotoxic activities of extracts were studied against NIH3T3 cells, and to determine the selectivity of the extracts towards carcinogenic cell lines. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the extracts were determined against cell lines in Table 6.
