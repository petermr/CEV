<p>As a conclusion, DE extract indicated lower cytotoxic effect on NIH3T3 cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 849.25 µg/mL), while it showed higher value of IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 316 µg/mL cytotoxic effect on A549 cell line and its selectivity index was calculated as 2.69. This finding improved the DE extract can be employed as a candidate in anticancer therapy. This extract can lead into
