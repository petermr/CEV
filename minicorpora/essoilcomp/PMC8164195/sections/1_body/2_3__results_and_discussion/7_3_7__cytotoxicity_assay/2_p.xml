<p>The compounds should be nontoxic on healthy cell lines and show cytotoxic effect in cancer cell lines as anticancer drug candidates. Hence, cytotoxic effect of the extracts against NIH3T3 cell line was tested. Cytotoxic activity was found to be EAc (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 99.15 µg/mL), MeOH (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 613.52 µg/mL), DE (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 849.25 µg/mL), and H (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 1000 µg/mL) extracts, respectively against NIH3T3 cells. EAc extract showed higher cytotoxicity on NIH3T3 cell lines. Conversely, H and DE extracts showed lower cytotoxicity on NIH3T3 cells.
