<p>In the present study, we evaluated the chemical composition of the EO of 
 <italic>P. linearis</italic> obtained by hydrodistillation of aerial part of 
 <italic>P. linearis</italic>. The hydrodisitillation resulted with yellowish EO with a pleasant odour. The oil yield calculated on water free basis was 0.07% (w/v). Chemical composition of EO was analysed with GC-MS/FID systems. The list of volatile compounds determined in the EO of 
 <italic>P. linearis</italic> with their relative retention indices, relative percentages are shown in Table 1. Twenty-four compounds were determined in the EO, representing 97.0% of the total oil composition. The major compounds of the oil were presented by monoterpene 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (12.5%) and sesquiterpenes namely: 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene (10.7%), 
 <italic>α</italic>-cadinol (10.4%), and germacrene D (8.8%). The major representatives of the oxygenated sesquiterpenes (32.8%) were found to be as 
 <italic>α-</italic>cadinol (10.4%), 
 <italic>α</italic>-eudesmol (5.7%), caryophyllene oxide (5.1%), 
 <italic>τ</italic>-muurolol (4.2%), 
 <italic>β</italic>-eudesmol (4.0%), and 
 <italic>δ</italic>-cadinol (3.4%). The sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (28.2 %) were the second important group in the oil with 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene (10.7%), germacrene D (8.8%), 
 <italic>δ</italic>-cadinene (6.2 %) and 
 <italic>γ</italic>-cadinene (2.5 %) as major constituents, respectively.
