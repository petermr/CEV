<p>Generally, antimicrobial acitivity have been focused on EO extracted from 
 <italic>Phlomis</italic> species in the literature. The EOs of 
 <italic>P. ferruginea</italic> Ten [70] 
 <italic>P. bovei</italic> De Noe subsp. bovei [71] 
 <italic>P. bracteosa</italic> Royle ex Benth. [72] 
 <italic>P. floccosa</italic> D. Don [73], 
 <italic>P. kurdica</italic> Rech. fil. [67] and isolated a few compounds as, forsythoside B, phlinoside C and verbascoside from 
 <italic>P. lanceolata</italic> [74] showed antimicrobial activities, while the EO of 
 <italic>P. linearis</italic> has been reported only in antiangiogenic and antiinflammatory activity [22]. In addition to EO, methanol extracts of 
 <italic>P. olivieri, P. bruguieri</italic>,
 <italic> and P.herba-venti</italic> were investigated in terms of their antibacterial effects against some bacteria pathogens [46]. To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first report on the antimicrobial activities of 
 <italic>P. linearis</italic> Boiss. &amp; Bal on different extracts.
