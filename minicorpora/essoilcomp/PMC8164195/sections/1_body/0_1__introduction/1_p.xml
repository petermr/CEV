<p>Medicinal plants have been very popular with researchers for the investigation of chemical profile and biological properties. Phytochemicals present in plants are valuable compounds of the human diet and used for the prevention of chronic diseases, such as degenerative disorders, cancer and diabetes, and as antiinfective agents. Plant secondary metabolites have many biological properties as they are antimicrobial [1–2], antioxidant, [3], enzyme inhibitor [4], antiinflammatory [5], antiproliferative [6], anticancer [7], and antidiabetic [8]. The antimicrobial activity of plant extracts and essential oils (EOs) has been known for many years. The researchers have documented various publications with the antimicrobial activity of Eos and plant extracts [2,9–12], their cytotoxic [7,13], and management of diabetes as α-amylase inhibitors [14–17].</p>
