<p>To date, very little research has been carried out on phytochemistry and biological activity for 
 <italic>P. linearis</italic>; there have been no attempts to examine the anti-acetylcholinesterase, anti-Î±-amylase, and antimicrobial activities, as well as cytotoxic effects against human lung cancer, human colon cancer, and mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines for 
 <italic>P. linearis</italic>. We aimed to investigate the phytochemical characterisation of EO, fatty acids and extracts from aerial parts of 
 <italic>P. linearis</italic>, and biological activities of the extracts and EO.
