<p>The present work is the first investigation on essential oil and extracts from aerial parts of 
 <italic>P. linearis </italic>to include on anti-acetylcholinesterase, anti-α-amylase, and antimicrobial activities, as well as cytotoxic effects. The phytochemical characterisation of essential oil, fatty acids, and extracts from aerial parts of 
 <italic>P. linearis</italic> were represented using GC-MS /FID and LC/MS-MS techniques. The essential oils and extracts of 
 <italic>P. linearis</italic> were found to have valuable phytochemicals with biological activities. The results showed that ethyl acetate extract of 
 <italic>P. linearis</italic> possess high antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 6538. Therefore, 
 <italic>P. linearis</italic> could be recommended for the combination with antimicrobial drugs for drug industry, especially against 
 <italic>S. aureus.</italic> Furthermore, diethyl ether extract indicated cytotoxic effect against human lung cancer cell lines. The best acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity was obtained for diethyl ether extract of 
 <italic>P. linearis.</italic>
