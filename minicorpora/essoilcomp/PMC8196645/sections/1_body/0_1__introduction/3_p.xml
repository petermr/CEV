<p>The counter-current chromatography (CCC) is a liquidâ€“liquid separation technique with numerous advantages compared to other chromatographic techniques, especially for the treatment of a large number of mixtures in an environmentally-friendly way [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-03072" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It is based on the different distribution of substances in the two miscible phases and is used for the fractionation of complex mixtures of compounds with a wide range of polarities [

 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-03072" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It is important to note that CCC is the most effective technique for the separation of high added-value compounds from unpolar extracts such as the phenolic fractions obtained from edible oils, triterpenic fractions of different gums, etc. [

 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-03072" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Nevertheless, the search of the literature for the analysis of essential oils by counter-current chromatography revealed the presence of a very limited number of similar scientific works. Most of them are related to the fractionation of essential oils [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-03072" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] or in the separation of specific volatile compounds [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-03072" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-03072" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-03072" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-03072" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] by using High-Speed Countercurrent Chromatography (hydrodynamic CCC). Only two scientific works were found focusing on the separation of essential oils using a Centrifugal Partition Chromatography (CPC) device (hydrostatic CCC). In the first one, Dang and et al. described the isolation and purification of six volatile compounds from essential oil (EO) of

 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-03072" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In both cases, the analysis was performed on a preparative scale. It is important to note that, compared to HSCCC, the CPC technology can be also used for large-scale separations, thus offeringthe advantage of pilot and industrial-scale applications.
