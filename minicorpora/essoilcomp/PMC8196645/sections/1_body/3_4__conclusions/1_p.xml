<p>In the current study an effective CPC-based protocol for the recovery of volatile compounds with repellent activity against 
 <italic>Ae. Albopictus</italic> was developed. The initial biological screening of five EOs of 
 <italic>Pinus</italic> and 
 <italic>Juniperus</italic> species revealed that the essential oil obtained from needles of 
 <italic>P. pinea</italic> presented significant ability to repel the Asian tiger mosquito. The EOs obtained from the wood part of 
 <italic>P. nigra</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>nigra</italic> and 
 <italic>P. hedreichii</italic> and the fruit of 
 <italic>J. oxycedrus</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>deltoides</italic> are tested herein for the first time and present moderate repellent activity. A rapid and effective CPC method for the isolation of the main terpenes of the EOs of 
 <italic>P. pinea</italic> and 
 <italic>J. oxycedrus</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>deltoides</italic> was developed. The CPC analyses of both EOs are presented here for the first time and resulted in the successful isolation of (−)-limonene, guaiol, 
 <italic>β</italic>-myrcene and germacrene D as well in the recovery of simple mixtures of (−)-limonene/
 <italic>β</italic>-phellandrene, 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene/
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene and 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene/germacrene D. From them, (−)-limonene, guaiol, and germacrene D presented high repellent activity against 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> while 
 <italic>β</italic>-myrcene showed only weak activity.
