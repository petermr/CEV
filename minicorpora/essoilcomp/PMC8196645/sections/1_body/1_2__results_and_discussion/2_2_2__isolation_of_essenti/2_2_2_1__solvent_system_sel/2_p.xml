<p>In order to have an efficient separation using the CPC technique, K
 <sub>D</sub> values between 0.2–5 and separation factors over 1.5 are needed [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-26-03072" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Taking into account the distribution coefficient values (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03072-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) we conclude that during the CPC analysis of JOX EO, 
 <italic>β</italic>-myrcene will be eluted first, following by 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene and the last, germacrnene D. Regarding the separation quality, the measured separation factors showed that only 
 <italic>β</italic>-myrcene will be completely separated (a &gt; 1.5). Concerning 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene and germacrnene D (a = 1.46 &lt; 1.5) there will be a partial overlap of the elution zones, thus giving fractions with pure 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene, fractions with pure germacrene D, and between those, some fractions with both compounds. As for the analysis of PPI EO, the compounds will be eluted in the following order: guaiol, 
 <italic>β</italic>-phelandrene, limonene, 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene, 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene, 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene. The calculated separation factors showed that guaiol will be completely separated from the other target compounds, limonene and 
 <italic>β</italic>-phelandrene will be separated from the other compounds but only partially separated between them, while 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene will be eluted at almost the same time with 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene and 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene (a &lt; 1.5). Overall, the calculated K
 <sub>D</sub> values and separation factors showed that the chosen biphasic system is capable to lead to an effective fractionation of the major compounds of both essential oils.
