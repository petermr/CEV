<p>The next step of the study includes the fractionation of the essential oils obtained from the fruits of 
 <italic>J. oxycedrus</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>deltoides</italic> (JOX) and the needles of the 
 <italic>P. pinea</italic> (PPI) by using Centrifugation Partition Chromatography. The goal here was both to develop an efficient method for the chromatographic analysis of EOs and to receive pure volatile compounds for further biological investigation regarding their repellent activity against 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. Based on the GC-MS analysis of the two selected EOs, the CPC analysis was focused on the recovery of enriched fractions of their main components i.e., 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene, 
 <italic>β</italic>-myrcene and germacrene D from JOX and 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene, limonene, 
 <italic>β</italic>-phelandrene, 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene, and guaiol from PPI.
