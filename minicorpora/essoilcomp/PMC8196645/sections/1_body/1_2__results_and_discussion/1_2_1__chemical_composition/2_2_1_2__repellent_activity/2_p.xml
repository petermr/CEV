<p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the repellent activity of the essential oils from the wood part of 
 <italic>P. nigra</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>nigra</italic> and 
 <italic>P. hedreichii</italic> and the fruit of 
 <italic>J. oxycedrus</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>deltoides</italic> are tested against 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. On the other hand, the essential oil of the fruits of 
 <italic>J.</italic>
 <italic>turbinata</italic> grown in different places in Greece has been evaluated before [

 <xref rid="B37-molecules-26-03072" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In all references, although the aerial parts of 
 <italic>J.</italic>
 <italic>turbinata</italic> have a high amount of 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene, the rest of the constituents may differentiate and the results of the repellant are in accordance with our study. In contrast, Traboulsi and co-workers tested the EO from needles of 
 <italic>P. pinea</italic> against the 
 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> mosquito species and found that this EO was effective for protecting from mosquito bites [

 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-03072" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This fact may explain the good repellant activity of PPI essential oil in our bioassays. Nevertheless, substances such as pinenes, limonenes, etc. may occur in EOs in one or more enantiomeric forms [

 <xref rid="B40-molecules-26-03072" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Since the enantioselectivity may play an important role in the activity of EOs, further phytochemical analysis and biological investigation of the individual components is needed in order to safely correlate the chemical composition with the repellent activity.
