<p>The essential oil obtained from fruits of 
 <italic>J. turbinata</italic> were characterized by a high abundance of α-pinene (81.72%). It is important to note that the species 
 <italic>J. turbinata</italic> of E. Mediterranean and Greek origin was previously recorded as 
 <italic>J. phoenicea</italic> [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-26-03072" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Thus, the previous works regarding the GC-MS analysis of EOs from the fruits of 
 <italic>J. phoenicea</italic>, published by Evergetis et al. [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-26-03072" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and Vourlioti-Arapi et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-03072" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], refer to the same plant material (fruits of 
 <italic>J.</italic>
 <italic>turbinata</italic>) and showed that α-pinene is also the major volatile compound. On the other hand, 
 <italic>β</italic>-myrcene (43.53%) is the main compound of EO from fruits of 
 <italic>J. oxycedrus</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>deltoides</italic> followed by germacrene D (23.77%) and 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (15.65%). These results are in accordance with the previously-published data, where 
 <italic>β</italic>-myrcene, germacrene D and 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene ware presented in 53.85%, 17.03% and 19.70%, respectively [
