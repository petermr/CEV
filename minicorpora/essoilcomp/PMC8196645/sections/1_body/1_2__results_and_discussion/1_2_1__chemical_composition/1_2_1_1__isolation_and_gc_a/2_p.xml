<p>All obtained oils were analyzed by GC-MS (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-03072">Figure S1a–e: Supplementary Material</xref>). The major constituents of each EO are presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03072-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, while the detailed chemical compositions are given in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-03072">Table S2 (supplementary material)</xref>. The GC-MS analysis resulted in the identification of 92.11%, 98.40%, 97.88%, 98.19% and 98.68% of constituents for PNI, PHE, PPI, JTU and JOX EOs respectively. The PNI essential oil was characterized by a wide range of volatile compounds. Totally 43 secondary metabolites were identified from which 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (32.82%) and sandaracopimarinal (18.10%) were presented as major components, followed by 
 <italic>δ</italic>-cadinene (5.23%) and 
 <italic>γ</italic>-muurolene (4.93%) (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03072-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, 13 volatile compounds were presented in concentrations between 1–4% while the other constituents are presented in traces (&lt;1%) (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-03072">Table S1: Supplementary Material</xref>). The chemical composition of the above EO significantly differs from the previously published data for the EO of wood of 
 <italic>P. nigra</italic> where limonene, citronellol, 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene and 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene were found to be the major constituents [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-26-03072" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. PHE essential oil is less complicated than the previous one, containing only 13 volatile compounds. From them, cis-
 <italic>β</italic>-terpineol (47.41%) constitutes the major compound, followed by longifolene (11.88%) thunbergol (9.61%) and 
 <italic>α</italic>-terpineol (9.19%) (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03072-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The results of the above analysis differ considerably from the previously-published results for the essential oils from wood [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-26-03072" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and needles [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-03072" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] of 
 <italic>P. heldreichii</italic>. On the other hand, the analysis of PPI essential oil showed the presence of 18 volatile compounds from which limonene (45.45%) was presented as the major constituent followed by 
 <italic>β</italic>-phelladrene (12.79%) and 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (9.50%) (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03072-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These results are in accordance with the previously published data in witch limonene (39.05%), 
 <italic>β</italic>-phelladrene (13.8%) and 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (5.13%) were presented in similar concentrations [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-26-03072" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].
