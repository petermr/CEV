<p>Germacrene D, isolated from JOX EO, presented high repellent activity (97.4% repellency: 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03072-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). In contrast, the isolated 
 <italic>β</italic>-myrcene presented the lowest activity (31.4% repellency: 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03072-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) among all the tested samples. The low activity of 
 <italic>β</italic>-myrcene (main compound of JOX EO) compared to the moderate activity of 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene explains the low repellent activity presented from the JOX essential oil. However, the CPC analysis of this EO resulted in the recovery of the active volatile compound germacrene D, which was isolated and tested for the first time against this mosquito species.
