<p>From the isolated compounds, (−)-limonene, guaiol and germacrene D showed “DEET-like” repellent activity. Guaiol and (−)-limonene, isolated from PPI EO presented the highest activity with 100% and 99.6% repellency respectively. Both compounds were isolated and tested for the first time against 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. On the other hand, the two tasted mixtures containing (−)-limonene and 
 <italic>β</italic>-pheladrene at ratios of 55/45 and 70/30 also showed high repellent activity (98.1% and 99.1% repellency respectively). This fact led us to conclude that not only (−)-limonene, but also 
 <italic>β</italic>-pheladrene is an active compound against the Asian tiger mosquito. Taking into account that 
 <italic>α</italic>- and 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinenes presented moderate activity (57.5% repellency of their mixture:

 <italic>β</italic>-pheladrene and guaiol are responsible for the high repellent activity of the PPI essential oil (
