<p>Essential oils of 
 <italic>P. pinea</italic> and 
 <italic>J. oxycedrus</italic>Â subsp. 
 <italic>deltoides</italic> were fractionated by CPC using for both experiments the biphasic solvent system composed of n-Heptane/Acetonitrile/Butanol 1.6/1.6/0.2 
 <italic>v/v/v</italic>. The appropriate biphasic system was selected according to the partition coefficient K
 <sub>D</sub> of the target compounds. The K
 <sub>D</sub> values were determined by GC-MS analysis using the following procedure: 10 mg of essential oil was added to the mixture of 3.4 mL of the biphasic system (1.6 mL n-Heptane, 1.6 mL Acetonitrile and 0.2 mL Butanol) and the solution was then mixed thoroughly by shaking. After the system equilibration, the two phases were separated and analyzed by GC-MS (

 <sub>D</sub> value was expressed as the peak area of the target compounds in the stationary phase divided by the one in the mobile phase (
