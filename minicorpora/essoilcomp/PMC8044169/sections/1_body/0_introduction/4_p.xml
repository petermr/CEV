 </sup> have been reported in different countries, but so far, the antibacterial and antifungal activity of this oil has not been investigated simultaneously on 11 strains of microorganisms. This study was performed for the first time to investigate the composition of essential oils obtained from Rose Damascus harvested from Isfahan region of Iran and its antibacterial and antifungal activity.
