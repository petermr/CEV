<p id="Par11">The minimum concentration capable of inhibiting the growth was calculated for microbial susceptible to the extracts by means of microdilution method. In this method, various dilutions of the essential oil were prepared. A specific amount of sample was weighed and a suitable ratio of TSB medium and DMSO solvent were used to prepare the initial stock with the concentration of 2000 μg/mL. Then, serial dilutions to obtain lower concentrations (1000, 500, 250, 125, 62.5, 31.25, and 15.63 µg/mL) were prepared. For this purpose, sterile 96-well microplates were provided. To each plate 95 µL of culture medium, 5 µL of bacterial suspension with 0.5 McFarland dilution, and 100 µL of different essential oil dilutions were added, and then the plate was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h for bacterial strains and at 30 °C for 48 h for yeast. Based on the opacity and color change in each well, MIC or minimum concentration capable of inhibiting the growth was determined. To determine the minimum bacterial concentration (MBC), after 24 h incubation, wells containing non-growth medium were inoculated with nutrient agar medium and incubated at 37 °C for further 24 h. These tests were performed in triplicate.</p>
