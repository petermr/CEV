<p id="Par8">The determination of the constituents of essential oil samples was done by Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Model 6890 chromatography coupled with Agilent model N-5973 mass spectrometer with HP-5MS capillary column with 5% Methylphenylsiloxane static phase (length 30 m, internal diameter 0.25 mm, layer static thickness 0.25 μm) and ionization energy of 70 eV was used for qualitative identification of components. In temperature programming for the analysis, the temperature would first start at 60 °C in the oven and then would rise at a rate of 3–246 °C. The temperature of injector and detector temperature were was 250 °C, the sample volume was 1 µl with 1.50 split and the helium carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min. The chemical components of the essential oils were identified based on the analysis of the chromatograms of each oil regarding the retention indices (RI) in relation to standards of n-alkane mixtures (C8-C20) and mass spectral data of each peak using a computer library (Wiley-14 and NIST-14 Mass Spectral Library), along with comparing these data with literature
