<p id="Par16">Oleic acid with the amount of 17.63% was the third dominant component of rose essential oil, which was only reported previously in New Delhi with the amount of 0.37%

 </sup>. This fatty acid has not been previously recorded in rose essential oils in Iran, while in this essential oil has been detected in high percentage, indicating a specific genotype of Iranian rose in the world. Oleic acid (9-Octadecenoic acid) is a component of omega-9 unsaturated fatty acids that is beneficial for the human body

 </sup>. Indeed, it is well known that unsaturated fatty acids reduce cholesterol by activating cholesterol acetyltransferase

Its derivatives have a regulatory role on the cell membrane and have been used as an anticancer drug as they may induce apoptosis in cancer cells

 </sup>. Also, two saturated fatty acids of stearic acid (4.09%) and palmitic acid (4.49%) were found in the essential oil that has not been previously detected in any of the essential oil from rose in the world. Palmitic and stearic acids are considered as precursors for the production of unsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid. In other words, saturated fatty acids such as palmitic acid and stearic acid may be converted in oleic acid by enzymatic activity
