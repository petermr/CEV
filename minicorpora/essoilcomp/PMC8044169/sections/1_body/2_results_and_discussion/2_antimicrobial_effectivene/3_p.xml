 <italic>K. pneumonia</italic>e with inhibition halo of 8.00 ± 0.00 mm, which was equal to that obtain by using rifampin and gentamicin (8 mm). However, the inhibitory and lethal power of the essential oil against this bacterium (MIC and MBC = 500 μg/mL) was not significant. But compared to the study of Jirovetz et al.

 </sup> on Bulgarian rose oil (diameter of inhibition zone of 10 mm and MIC of 600 μg/mL), the effect of rose oil in the present study was better. High levels of citronellol as well as the presence of geraniol in the rose essential oil seemed to be responsible for the inhibition of the growth of this bacterium. Some researchers reported that rose essential oils containing citronellol and geraniol had strong antimicrobial activity against some bacteria including this

 </sup>. On the other hand, the presence of oleic acid, stearic acid, and palmitic acid are other compounds contributing to the antibacterial effect of this essential oil. Fatty acids have antifungal and antibacterial activities against many microorganisms whose spectrum of activity varies by degree of saturation, carbon-chain length and orientation of the double bond

 </sup>. Although the mechanism of antibacterial activity of fatty acids is not yet known, it is believed that their functional nature is related to the permeability and membrane disruption and fatal alterations in the cytoplasmic content of the bacterium, thereby rupture/alteration of the membrane-dependent conduction systems may occur

 </sup>. Carbapenemase-producing 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> infections will be associated with increased treatment costs and prolonged hospitalization, treatment failure, and mortality. The poor prognosis of infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria producing carbapenemase has been reported. In a USA report on circulatory infections caused by carbapenemase-producing bacteria in 2011, patients reported a mortality rate of 47 to 66 percent. A study has shown that the risk of dying is twice as high in patients with infections caused by these strains
