<p id="Par19">The antibacterial and antifungal properties of essential oil isolated from 
 <italic>R. damascena</italic> flower was evaluated by measuring the inhibition halo diameter, the MIC, and the MBC. Results are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The highest inhibition halo of rose essential oil was against 
 <italic>A. brasiliensis</italic> (15.00 ± 0.00 mm), as its antifungal activity was higher that obtained by treating the same strain with nystatin (30 mm), while the inhibitory and lethal effects of the essential oil against this fungus were not significant. Interestingly, the antifungal activity of rose oil has not been previously studied in any area of the world, therefore, there was no study to compare the obtained results. This antifungal property can be connected with the activity of oxygenated compounds such as linalool

 </sup>. The antimicrobial effect of the essential oil is not only due to their major constituents. Indeed, it is also possible that compounds in lower amount are likely to have synergistic effects with other active compounds

 </sup> promoting their effects. 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> infections can occur in a variety of forms, including disease in hosts with normal immunity, infection in damaged host tissues, and infection in suppressed hosts

 </sup>. On the other hand, due to the presence of degrading enzymes in these fungi, they can cause a high degree of corruption when they are on or inside the food, threatening human and animal health. Therefore, rose oil in the present study is a good natural source against the growth of 
 <italic>A. brasiliensis</italic> and it prevents human diseases as well as food spoilage.
