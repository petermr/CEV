 <italic>C. albicans</italic> was below 6 mm (ND), and a significant inhibition and lethal effect (MIC and MBC = 125 μg/mL) were also observes, which was similar to the nystatin antibiotic (125 μg/mL). In comparison with the essential oil of rose in Bulgaria in the study of Gochev et al.

 </sup> with MIC value of 1024–600 μg/mL, the effect of Iranian essential oil is significant. The high content of nonadecane and heneicosane alkanes in rose oil seems to be one of the most important factors of its effective antifungal activity. Previous studies indicate a high percentage of alkanes such as nonadecane in essential oils with improve the antimicrobial activity

 </sup>. Geraniol, on the other hand, is one of the contributing factors to its antifungal activity. The antifungal effect of geraniol on 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> has been previously demonstrated by Jirovetz et al.
