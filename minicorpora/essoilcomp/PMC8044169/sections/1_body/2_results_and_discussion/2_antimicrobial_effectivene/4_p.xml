<p id="Par22">Rose essential oil had a lower activity against Gram-positive 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (11.33 ± 0.58 mm) compared to rifampin and gentamicin (21 mm). However, the inhibitory and lethal power of the essential oil against these bacteria (MIC = 500 μg/mL and MBC = 1000 μg/mL) was not significant, which was less than the antibacterial activity of rose oil against this bacterium in Bulgaria (diameter of inhibition zone = 20 mm and MIC = 60 μg/mL), and Saudi Arabia (MIC = 250 μg/mL)

 <italic>S. aureus</italic> is one of the most important pathogens transmitted through food that is widely distributed in the environment and human and animal communities, both as pathogens and as normal flora. The presence of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> in the skin and respiratory organs of human and warm animals allows the transmission of this organism from human or animal to food materials and products
