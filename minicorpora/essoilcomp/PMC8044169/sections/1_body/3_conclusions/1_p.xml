<p id="Par24">Rose essential oil is an extractive product with high medicinal and economic value due to its fragrance quality. In the present study, on the one hand, citronellol and geraniol compounds produced a high quality aroma of this essential oil, and on the other hand, probably the prevalence of nonadecane and heneicosane alkanes and the presence of linalool caused strong antifungal activity against 
 <italic>A. brasiliensis</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Also, for the first time, saturated and unsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid, stearic acid and palmitic acid were found in large amount in this essential oil. These compounds might had a strong effect against Gram-negative bacterium 
 <italic>K. pneumonia</italic>, which should be the subject of the future studies. Therefore, this essential oil can be a potential natural compound for the prevention and treatment of fungal diseases in humans and food spoilage.
