    "The overuse of synthetic pesticides in plant protection strategies has resulted in numerous side effects, including environmental contamination, food staff residues, and a threat to non-target organisms. Several studies have been performed to assess the pesticidal effects of plant-derived essential oils and their components, as partially safe and effective agents, on economically important pests. The essential oils isolated from Satureja species are being used in medicinal, cosmetic, and food industries. Their great potential in pest management is promising, which is related to high amounts of terpenes presented in this genus. This review is focused on the acute and chronic acaricidal, insecticidal, and nematicidal effects of Satureja essential oil and their main components. The effects of eighteen Satureja species are documented, considering lethality, repellency, developmental inhibitory, and adverse effects on the feeding, life cycle, oviposition, and egg hatching. Further, the biochemical impairment, including impairments in esterases, acetylcholinesterase, and cytochrome P450 monooxygenases functions, are also considered. Finally, encapsulation and emulsification methods, based on controlled-release techniques, are suggested to overcome the low persistence and water solubility restrictions of these biopesticides. The present review offers Satureja essential oils and their major components as valuable alternatives to synthetic pesticides in the future of pest management."
