<p>The plant is a chemically complex species, due to its numerous natural constituents [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-26-02774" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Cannabinoids, a specific chemical class found in cannabis, are produced in the glandular trichomes of the plant. Among the cannabinoid constituents of cannabis, Δ
 <sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ
 <sup>9</sup>-THC), which is naturally present in the form of an acid (Δ
 <sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, Δ
 <sup>9</sup>-THCA), is the main psychoactive constituent of the plant. Decarboxylation of the acid with age or heat is required to form the pharmacologically active Δ
 <sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol [
