<p>Cannabis is primarily a dioecious plant (male and female flowers occur on individual plants); it is only occasionally found as a hermaphrodite (male and female flowers on the same plant). It flowers under a short photoperiod (below 12 h of light) and continues growing vegetatively during the longer photoperiod days.</p>
