<p>The present review discusses the chemistry of all identified major Cannabis constituents including cannabinoid and non-cannabinoid constituents (nonâ€“cannabinoid phenols, flavonoids, terpenes, and alkaloids), with special emphasis on the chemical structures, methods of isolation, and identification. This review also updated the chemistry of 125 cannabinoids, 42 phenolics, 34 flavonoids, 120 terpenes and 2 alkaloids. The last review on cannabis chemistry was published by our group in 2017 as a chapter book which focused on the new constituents reported between 2005 and 2017 only but, in this review, we provided a chemical account on the chemistry of major constituents (323 compounds) of cannabis from 1940 up to now along with their structures. For the reader, this review should provide almost all the information of cannabinoids and non-cannabinoids, their methods of isolation, identification and structures in one place. In addition, these 323 compounds include 12 new compounds (five cannabinoids, one cannabispiran, three flavonoids, and three terpenes). The inclusion of all the 323 chemical structures along with all other details makes this review unique.</p>
