<p>Cannabidiol (CBD, 
 <bold>47</bold>) was isolated from an ethanolic extract (red oil) of Minnesota wild hemp. It was purified as a 
 <italic>bis</italic>-3,5-dinitrobenzoate crystalline derivative [

 <italic>C. sativa</italic> after extraction with benzene and identified by comparing its UV spectrum with that of CBD derivatives [

 <sub>5</sub>, 
 <bold>49</bold>) was isolated from the decarboxylated ethanol extract of hemp leaves on using florisil and silica gel column chromatography. CBDM (
 <bold>49</bold>) was identified by comparing its physical properties with an authentic sample YA [
