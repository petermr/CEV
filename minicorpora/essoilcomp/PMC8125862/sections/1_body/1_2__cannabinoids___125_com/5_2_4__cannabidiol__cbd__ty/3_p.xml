<p>Recently, two new CBD homologues with 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexyl and 
 <italic>n</italic>-heptyl side chain were isolated from the hexane extract of 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> and their chemical structures were assigned as cannabidihexol (CBDH, 
 <bold>54</bold>) and cannabidiphorol (CBDP, 
 <bold>55</bold>). The two compounds were purified using a semi-preparative C18 HPLC using a mixture of ACN/0.1 aqueous formic acid as a mobile phase. The fractions containing 
 <bold>52</bold> and 
 <bold>53</bold> were analyzed by HRESMS. The chemical structures of CBDH and CBDP were determined by HNMR, C-NMR, UV, and HR-ESI-MS and confirmed by stereoselective synthesis [
