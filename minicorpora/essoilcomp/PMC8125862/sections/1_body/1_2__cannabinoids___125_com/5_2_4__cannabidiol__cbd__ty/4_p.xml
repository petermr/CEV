<p>In 2020, a CBD dimer was isolated from the hexane extract of hemp and named Cannabitwinol, (CBDD, 
 <bold>56</bold>). The hexane extract was chromatographed on a Sigel column, which was eluted with hexane/CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub> followed by semi preparative C18-HPLC using a mixture of ACN/H
 <sub>2</sub>O/formic acid (7:3:0.1) as the mobile phase. The chemical structure of CBDD (
 <bold>56</bold>) was determined by applying a plethora of 1D and 2D NMR at −30 °C and was confirmed by HRESIMS and MS/MS spectrometry. The authors confirmed the chemical structure of 
 <bold>56</bold> as two units of CBD connected by a methylene bridge and suggested that the dimerization of CBD occurred as a result of enzymatic reaction medicated by a one-carbon donor enzyme like methylene tetrahydrofolate [
