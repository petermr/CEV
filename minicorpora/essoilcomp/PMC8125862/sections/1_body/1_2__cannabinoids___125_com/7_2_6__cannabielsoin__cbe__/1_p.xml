<p>In 1973, cannabielsoin (CBE-C5, 
 <bold>59</bold>) was detected in the ethanolic extract of Lebanese hashish. The extract was subjected to counter current distribution followed by GCMS analysis [

 <bold>60</bold>) and cannabielsoin acid B (CBEAB, 
 <bold>61</bold>) were isolated from hashish; the structural elucidation was carried by NMR spectroscopy and chemical transformations [

 <bold>62</bold>) and Cannabielsoic acid B-C3 (CBEAB-C3, 
 <bold>63</bold>) were also reported from cannabis [
