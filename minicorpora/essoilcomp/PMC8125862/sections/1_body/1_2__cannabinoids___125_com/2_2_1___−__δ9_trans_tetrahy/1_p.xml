<p>The isolation of pure (−)-Δ
 <sup>9</sup>-
 <italic>trans</italic>-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ
 <sup>9</sup>-THC, 
 <bold>1</bold>), from a hexane extract of hashish using column chromatography over florisil followed by alumina was reported by Goani and Mecholum in 1964. A crystalline nitrophenylurethane derivative of THC was prepared, followed by a mild alkaline hydrolysis for further purification of THC. IR and NMR spectroscopic techniques were used to elucidate its chemical structure [

 <sup>9</sup>-
 <italic>trans</italic>-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid A (Δ
 <sup>9</sup>-THCAA, 
 <bold>2</bold>) was isolated using a cellulose powder column (eluted with a mixture of hexane and dimethylformamide), followed by preparative thin layer chromatography. The chemical structure of THCAA (
 <bold>2</bold>) was elucidated through a combination of UV, IR, and NMR spectroscopic analysis [

 <sup>9</sup>-THCAA (
 <bold>2</bold>) was also reported using an acid–base extraction procedure [

 <sup>9</sup>-THC (
 <bold>1</bold>) and Δ
 <sup>9</sup>-THCAA (
 <bold>2</bold>) from 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> plant material was optimized, using an enhanced extraction procedure, and the separation of Δ
 <sup>9</sup>-THC (
 <bold>1</bold>) was further improved using fractional distillation. For extensive separation, different stationary phases, such as silica, alumina, and C
 <sub>18</sub> silica, were tested to obtain pure Δ
 <sup>9</sup>-THC (
 <bold>1</bold>) with a high yield. Following these tests, an efficient, preparative C
 <sub>18</sub> HPLC method was developed for the purification of Δ
 <sup>9</sup>-THC (
 <bold>1</bold>) from the distillate. These steps resulted in an overall reduced cost of production [
