<p>Cannabisol (
 <bold>23</bold>) was isolated from a group of illicit cannabis samples received under the cannabis potency monitoring program, with a high CBG content using flash silica gel chromatography eluted with hexane/CHCl
 <sub>3</sub> (1:1). The structure of 
 <bold>23</bold> was unambiguously deduced by HRESIMS, GCMS, and NMR spectroscopy. GC-MS analysis of these samples indicated the dimeric nature of the compound, displaying two molecular ion peaks at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 314 and 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 328, corresponding to Δ
 <sup>9</sup>-THC and 2-methyl-Δ
 <sup>9</sup>-THC, respectively [
