<p>Two new heptyl and hexyl homologs of Δ

 <sup>9</sup>-
 <italic>trans</italic>-tetrahydrocannabiphorol (
 <bold>24</bold>) and (−)-Δ
 <sup>9</sup>-
 <italic>trans</italic>-tetrahydrocannabihexol (
 <bold>25</bold>) were recently isolated from the hexane extract of 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> inflorescences of an Italian origin (strain CIN-RO). The hexane extract was cooled at −20 °C for 48 h to remove waxes by precipitation. The dewaxed extract was subjected to semi-preparative liquid chromatography on a C18 stationary phase column to isolate compounds 
 <bold>24</bold> and 
 <bold>25</bold> after heating the corresponding acids at 120 °C for 2 h as clear oil. 
 <sup>1</sup> H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR, circular dichroism (CD) and UV absorption spectroscopy, along with LC-HRMS were used to determine their chemical structure. Both compounds were prepared synthetically using stereoselective synthesis to confirm their chemical structures [
