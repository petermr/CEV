<p>Cannabichromene (CBC, 
 <bold>67</bold>) was isolated from the hexane extract of hashish, using column chromatography (florisil column) in 1966 [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-26-02774" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The carboxylic acid derivative of CBC (
 <bold>67</bold>), cannabichromenic acid (CBCA, 
 <bold>68</bold>) was isolated from the benzene extract of hemp, using silica-gel column chromatography. The chemical structure of CBCA (
 <bold>68</bold>) was determined using IR, NMR, and UV spectroscopies [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-02774" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Cannabivarichromene (± CBCV, 
 <bold>69</bold>) was identified through GC-MS analysis, and both cannabichromevarin (+ CBCV, 
 <bold>70</bold>) and cannabichromevarinic acid (CBCVA, 
 <bold>71</bold>) were isolated from a benzene extract of the “Meao” variant of cannabis from Thailand [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-02774" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Three cannabichromene derivatives, (±)-4-acetoxycannabichromene (
 <bold>72</bold>), (±)-3”-hydroxy-Δ
 <sup>4”</sup>-cannabichromene (
 <bold>73</bold>) and (–)-7-hydroxycannabichromane (
 <bold>74</bold>), were isolated from high potency 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> using silica-gel VLC, normal-phase silica HPLC, and reverse-phase silica (C
 <sub>18</sub>) HPLC. These derivatives (
 <bold>72</bold>–
 <bold>74</bold>) were chemically identified using 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic techniques [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-26-02774" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In 1984, the CBC-C
 <sub>3</sub> derivative (
 <bold>75</bold>) was reported, and using mass spectral analysis, the chemical structure of the CBC-C
 <sub>3</sub> derivative (
 <bold>75</bold>) was determined to be 2-methyl-2-(4-methyl-2-pentyl)-7-propyl-2H-1-benzopyran-5-ol [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-26-02774" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The structures of these nine CBC-type cannabinoids (
 <bold>67</bold>–
 <bold>75</bold>) are shown in
