<p>Krote and Sieper isolated cannabicyclol (CBL, 
 <bold>64</bold>) from hashish by thin layer chromatography, but its structure was correctly elucidated by Mechoulam and Gaoni in 1967, based on spectral data [

 <xref rid="B48-molecules-26-02774" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The relative configuration of CBL (
 <bold>64</bold>) was determined by X-ray analysis in 1970 [

 <bold>65</bold>) was obtained from the benzene extract of cannabis. The benzene extract was chromatographed on a polyamide column using methanol water as a mobile phase. CBLA was isolated as a methylated derivative and considered to be an artifact formed when CBCA is naturally irradiated during storage [

 <bold>66</bold>) was detected in the ether extract of Congo marihuana and was identified by GLC and GCMS [

 <bold>65</bold>) was determined to be produced during the natural irradiation of cannabichromenic acid (CBCA, 
 <bold>68</bold>), proving that CBLA is not a natural cannabinoid [
