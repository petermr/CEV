<p>The chemical structure and the isolation details of seven cannabinol derivatives (
 <bold>76</bold>–
 <bold>82</bold>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02774-f005">Figure 5</xref>) have been reported in 1980 [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-02774" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Both 8-hydroxycannabinol (
 <bold>83</bold>) and 8-hydroxy cannabinolic acid A (
 <bold>84</bold>) were isolated from the high potency variety of 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> and chemically identified based on NMR and high-resolution mass (HR-MS) analysis in 2009 [

 <bold>85</bold>) and 4-terpenyl cannabinolate (
 <bold>86</bold>) were isolated from the same cannabis variety (high potency 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic>), and their chemical structures were confirmed by GC-MS analysis [
