 <italic>,</italic> three cannabichromanones were isolated, namely cannabichromanone B (
 <bold>110</bold>), C (
 <bold>111</bold>), and D (
 <bold>112</bold>). The absolute configurations of these three cannabinoids were assigned on the basis of the Mosher ester and inspection of their circular dichroism spectra. The isolation of these compounds was performed using semi-preparative C
 <sub>18</sub> HPLC [

 <bold>113</bold>), 4-acetoxy-2-geranyl-5-hydroxy-3-
 <italic>n</italic>-pentylphenol (
 <bold>114</bold>), and 2-geranyl-5-hydroxy-3-
 <italic>n</italic>-pentyl-1,4-benzoquinone (
 <bold>115</bold>) were isolated from the buds and leaves of the same variety of cannabis (high potency 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic>) using several chromatographic techniques, including silica-gel VLC, solid-phase extraction, reverse-phase columns (C
 <sub>18</sub> SPE), and normal-phase HPLC. In addition, 5-acetoxy-6-geranyl-3-
 <italic>n</italic>-pentyl-1,4-benzoquinone (
 <bold>116)</bold> was isolated on silica gel column chromatography followed by normal-phase HPLC [

 <bold>117</bold>) was isolated from a non-psychotropic variety of 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic>. This unusual metabolite is presumably formed from CBD and was isolated from a polar fraction of hemp by using flash chromatography over reverse-phase C
 <sub>18</sub> silica gel followed by normal-phase HPLC. The chemical identity of CBM (
 <bold>117</bold>) was revealed by a combination of 1D and 2D NMR along with ESI-MS spectroscopic techniques [

 <bold>118</bold>) was isolated in 2011 from a cannabis variety called Carmagnola by applying many chromatographic techniques including RP-18 column, silica gel column chromatography, and NP-HPLC chromatography. Its chemical structure was established using MS and NMR data [
 <xref rid="B65-molecules-26-02774" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Seven more cannabinoids (
