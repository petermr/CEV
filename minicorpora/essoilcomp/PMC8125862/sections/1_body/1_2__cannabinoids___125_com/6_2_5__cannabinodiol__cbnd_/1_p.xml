<p>Only two cannabinodiol (CBND) type cannabinoids (
 <bold>57</bold> and 
 <bold>58</bold>) have been reported (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02774-f004">Figure 4</xref>). In 1972, cannabinodivirin (CBND-C
 <sub>3</sub>, 
 <bold>57</bold>) was detected in hashish by GC-MS analysis [

 <sub>5</sub>, 
 <bold>58</bold>) was isolated from Lebanese hasish, using silica-gel column chromatography. The structure of CBND-C
 <sub>5</sub> (
 <bold>58</bold>) was determined by 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR and confirmed by the phytochemical transformation of cannabinol into cannabinodiol [
