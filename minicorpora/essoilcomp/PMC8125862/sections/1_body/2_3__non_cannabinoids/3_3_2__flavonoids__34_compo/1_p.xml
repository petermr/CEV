<p>Thirty-four flavonoids were isolated from 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> (
 <bold>168</bold>–
 <bold>201</bold>), which could be categorized into seven basic chemical skeletons that can be methylated, glycosylated (C or O glycosides), prenylated, or geranylated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02774-f013">Figure 13</xref>). The seven chemical structures of the flavonoid aglycones are orientin, vitexin, isovitexin, apigenin, luteolin, kaempferol and quercetin. The details of the isolation and chemical structures of 19 flavonoids (
 <bold>168</bold>–
 <bold>171</bold>, 
 <bold>173</bold>–
 <bold>175</bold>, 
 <bold>178</bold>–
 <bold>184</bold>, 
 <bold>187</bold>–
 <bold>188</bold>, and 
 <bold>193</bold>–
 <bold>195</bold>) isolated from 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> were reviewed by turner et al. in 1980 [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-02774" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The flavonoid glycosides, vitexin (
 <bold>172</bold>), cytisoside (
 <bold>176</bold>) and cytisoside glucoside (
 <bold>177</bold>), were identified from Canadian cannabis plants grown from seeds, where the authors used TLC, a hydrolytic test and UV spectroscopic analysis to determine their chemical structures [
 <xref rid="B86-molecules-26-02774" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Crombie et al. isolated two methylated isoprenoid flavones named Canniflavone 1 and Canniflavone 2 from a Thailand strain of cannabis [
 <xref rid="B79-molecules-26-02774" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]; four years later, Barrett et al. isolated the same two compounds and named them Canniflavin A (
 <bold>189</bold>, prenyl flavone) and Canniflavin B (
 <bold>190</bold>, geranyl flavone) from the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic>. The structures were elucidated by using UV, 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectroscopic techniques [
 <xref rid="B87-molecules-26-02774" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. In 2008, Radwan el al isolated another methylated isoprenoid flavone, canniflavin C (
 <bold>191</bold>), along with 6-prenylapigenin (
 <bold>185</bold>) and chrysoeriol (
 <bold>192</bold>), from a high potency variety of 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> grown in Mississippi polar fractions by using combination of various chromatographic techniques, such as VLC, silica gel column chromatography, and RP-HPLC. The geranyl moiety in Canniflavin C (
 <bold>191</bold>) is attached to the C-8 instead of the C-6 as in Canniflavin B based on 1D and 2D NMR analysis [
 <xref rid="B80-molecules-26-02774" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. The glycoside apigenin-6,8-di-C-β-D-glucopyranoside (
 <bold>186</bold>) was isolated from the methanolic extract of hemp [
 <xref rid="B88-molecules-26-02774" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], Two flavonoid glycosides (
 <bold>196</bold>–
 <bold>197</bold>) were isolated from the pollen grains of the male plants of a Mexican variety of 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> that was cultivated at the University of Mississippi. Their chemical structures were identified as kaempferol-3-O-sophoroside (
 <bold>196</bold>) and quercetin-3-O-sophoroside (
 <bold>197</bold>) based on 1D and 2D NMR and UV experiments [
 <xref rid="B89-molecules-26-02774" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. The flavonoid glycoside Rutin (
 <bold>198</bold>) was isolated for the first time from hemp pectin. The ethanolic extract was purified by macroreticular resin, silica gel column chromatography, and Sephadex-LH-20. Spectroscopic methods (ESI-MS, 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR, 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR) were used for identification of its chemical structure [
