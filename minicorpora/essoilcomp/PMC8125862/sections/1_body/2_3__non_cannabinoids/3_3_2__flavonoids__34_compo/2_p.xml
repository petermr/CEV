<p>The flavonoids Quercetin (
 <bold>199</bold>), Naringenin (
 <bold>200</bold>), and Naringin (
 <bold>201</bold>) were identified and quantified in the hydroalcoholic extract of hemp inflorescence from monoecious cultivars grown in Central Italy. Four cultivars (Ferimon, Uso-31, Felina 32 and Fedora) were analyzed at four stages of growth from flowering to ripening using HPLC-PDA. Naringenin (
 <bold>200</bold>) and its glycoside (Naringin, 
 <bold>201</bold>) was detected only in Fedora 17 and Ferimon cultivars, respectively, while Quercetin (
 <bold>199</bold>) was present in the hydroalcohlic extract of the four cultivars [

 <bold>200</bold>) was also detected and quantified in the industrial hemp of Futura 75 cultivar cultivated in Italy and the quantification was performed by HPLC-DAD-MS of the water extract [
