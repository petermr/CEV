<p>A total of four miscellaneous terpenes have been identified in cannabis (

 <bold>319</bold>), are isophorone-type compounds and were isolated from Dutch hemp [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-26-02774" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Both were identified from the stems and leaves of the plant through isolation, spectral data comparison, and synthesis from (+)-α-ionone. The other two miscellaneous-type compounds were identified from the volatile oil of
