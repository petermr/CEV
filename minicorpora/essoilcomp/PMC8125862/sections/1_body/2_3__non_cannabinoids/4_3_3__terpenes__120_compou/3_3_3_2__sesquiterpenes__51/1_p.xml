<p>In 1942, a study was conducted for the analysis of the higher boiling point fraction of Egyptian hashish, resulting in the identification of one sesquiterpene, α-caryophyllene (α-humulene) (
 <bold>263</bold>) [
 <xref rid="B95-molecules-26-02774" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. This was the first sesquiterpene to be identified in cannabis. Around 20 years later, in addition to α-caryophyllene (
 <bold>263</bold>), β-caryophyllene (
 <bold>264</bold>) was identified in the volatile oil of fresh 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic>, through GC analysis [
 <xref rid="B105-molecules-26-02774" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Five sesquiterpenes were identified in the volatile oil of Indian 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> in 1965. These sesquiterpenes were, namely, caryophyllene oxide (
 <bold>265</bold>), curcumene (
 <bold>266</bold>), α-
 <italic>trans</italic>-bergamotene (
 <bold>267</bold>), α-selinene (
 <bold>268</bold>), and β-farnesene (
 <bold>269</bold>), [
 <xref rid="B97-molecules-26-02774" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. In 1973, four new sesquiterpenes were reported from the analysis of the volatile oil of 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic>, namely longifolene (
 <bold>270</bold>), humulene epoxide I (
 <bold>271</bold>), humulene epoxide II (
 <bold>272</bold>), and caryophyllene alcohol (caryophyllenol) (
 <bold>273</bold>) [
 <xref rid="B106-molecules-26-02774" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. The sesquiterpene β-bisabolene (
 <bold>274</bold>) has only been reported in one study, which included the analysis of headspace volatiles, volatile oil, and samples of marijuana from Customs’ seizures [
 <xref rid="B101-molecules-26-02774" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Another three sesquiterpenes, allo-aromadendrene (
 <bold>275</bold>), calamenene (
 <bold>276</bold>), and α-copaene (
 <bold>277</bold>), were reported for the first time from the essential oil of 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> grown in Mexico in 1974. The compounds were identified using both GC/FID and GC/MS [
