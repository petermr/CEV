<p>Ross and ElSohly studied the composition of cannabis essential oil prepared by steam distillation of marijuana buds, by collecting the oil using the lighter-than-water volatile oil apparatus. The study included the preparation of volatile oil from fresh buds, as well as samples that were dried and stored at room temperature at three time points: 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months. The composition of the oils was then determined by GC-MS and GC-FID, where the percentage compositions of each component determined by the GC-FID method, and the presence of the terpenes was identified by GC-MS. There was a total of 68 components identified in the study, with 57 identified as monterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and other compounds, such as ketones and esters. The fresh budsâ€™ oil was determined to have the greatest composition of monoterpenes, at approximately 92.48%. Sesquiterpenes represented 6.84% of the total percent composition and other compounds represented only 0.68%. Analysis of the three-month samples showed a decrease in the percent composition of monoterpenes and an increase in the percent composition of sesquiterpenes and other compounds, where the monoterpenes represented 62.02% composition, the sesquiterpenes were 35.63%, and other compounds represented 2.35% of the volatile oil. Three new oxygenated monoterpenes were reported for the first time in this study, namely, ipsdienol (
