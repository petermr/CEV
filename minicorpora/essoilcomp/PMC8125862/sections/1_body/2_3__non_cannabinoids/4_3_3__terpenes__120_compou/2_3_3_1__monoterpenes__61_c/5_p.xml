<p>As the aroma of 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> L. is of high importance for the detection of illicit marijuana trafficking, the composition of the emitted aroma constituents was investigated, using a direct gas chromatographic analysis of the headspace components. The marijuana standard was grown and harvested at the University of Mississippi, and real samples were obtained from Customs’ seizures. The samples were prepared by weighing 1 g of each sample, placing it in a microvial, and heating the sample at 65 °C for 1 h. From the microvial, 5 mL of the headspace air was withdrawn using a gas-tight syringe and directly injected into the gas chromatograph. A total of 18 terpenic compounds were detected, out of which three compounds had not been previously reported, namely 2-methyl-2-heptene-6-one (
 <bold>227),</bold> fenchyl alcohol (
 <bold>254</bold>), and borneol (
 <bold>256</bold>), [
