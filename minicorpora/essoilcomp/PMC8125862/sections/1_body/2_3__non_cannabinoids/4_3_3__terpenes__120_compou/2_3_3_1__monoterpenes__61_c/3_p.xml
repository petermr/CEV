<p>Terpenoid-related compounds were detected from the hydrodistillation of freshly harvested 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> L. from India [
 <xref rid="B97-molecules-26-02774" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. The essential oil obtained from the hydrodistillation underwent fractional distillation, yielding five fractions. Fraction 5 was further chromatographed over alumina using petroleum ether, benzene, ether, and alcohol successively as eluents. The fractions collected with petroleum ether were combined and named Fraction 5-A, while the fractions collected with benzene as the solvent system were combined and collectively known as Fraction 5-B. Upon GC-MS and physico–chemical analyses, twenty-four different metabolites were detected, out of which 12 monoterpenes were not reported previously, namely α-terpinene (
 <bold>207</bold>), β-phellandrene (
 <bold>208</bold>), γ-terpinene (
 <bold>209</bold>), α-terpinolene (
 <bold>210</bold>), α-pinene (
 <bold>214</bold>), β-pinene (
 <bold>215</bold>), camphene (
 <bold>216</bold>), linalool (
 <bold>221</bold>), α-terpineol (
 <bold>232</bold>), terpinene-4-ol (
 <bold>233</bold>), linalool oxide (
 <bold>243</bold>), and sabinene hydrate (
 <bold>249</bold>) [
