<p>Two dihydrophenenathrens, cannabidihydrophenanthrene (cannithrene 1) (
 <bold>154</bold>) and cannithrene 2 (
 <bold>155</bold>), were isolated from Thailand cannabis [

 <xref rid="B79-molecules-26-02774" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. The chemical structure of cannithrene 2 was confirmed by X-ray crystallography of its diacetate derivative. The authors proposed that cannabidihydrophenanthrene (
 <bold>154</bold>) was biogenetically derived from cannabispiradienone (
 <bold>129</bold>) via a diene-phenol rearrangement [

 <bold>156</bold>â€“
 <bold>157</bold>) and one phenethrene derivative (
 <bold>158</bold>) were isolated from an ethanolic extract of a high potency cannabis variety grown in Mississippi using a combination of normal and reversed phase chromatographic techniques and were identified as 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3,7-trimethoxy-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene (
 <bold>156</bold>), 4-hydroxy-2,3,6,7-tetramethoxy-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene (
 <bold>157</bold>) and 4,7-dimethoxy-1,2,5-trihydroxyphenanthrene (
 <bold>158</bold>) [

 <bold>159</bold>) from an acetone extract of 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> chemotype (CARMA) after fractionation and column chromatography. Denbinobin (
 <bold>159</bold>) was purified by crystallization from ether [

 <italic>C. sativa</italic>, its chemical structure was determined as 2,3,5,6-tetramethoxy 9,10-dihydrophenanthrenedione (
 <bold>160</bold>) using 1D and 2D NMR as well as ESI-MS [
 <xref rid="B82-molecules-26-02774" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. The chemical structures of the reported dihydrophenathrenes and phenanthrenes are presented in
