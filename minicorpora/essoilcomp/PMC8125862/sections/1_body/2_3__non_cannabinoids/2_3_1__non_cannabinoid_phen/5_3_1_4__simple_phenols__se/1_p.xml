<p>Five simple phenols (

 <bold>167</bold>) were detected in the essential oil of Cannabis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02774-f012">Figure 12</xref>) and identified by GC/MS as eugenol (
 <bold>161</bold>), methyleugenol (
 <bold>162</bold>), iso-eugenol (
 <bold>163</bold>), trans-anethol (

 <bold>166</bold>) was isolated and identified from hemp pectin using silica gel column chromatography and identified via 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR, 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR, and ESI-MS spectroscopic methods [

 <bold>167</bold>) was identified from the stem exudate of greenhouse-grown 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> by TLC, but its aglycone (phloroglucinol) was isolated after acid hydrolysis of the exudate. Phloroglucinol was identified by 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR and GC/MS experiments [
