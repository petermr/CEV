<p>Twelve dihydrostilbenes (
 <bold>142</bold>–
 <bold>153</bold>) were isolated and identified from 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02774-f010">Figure 10</xref>). Turner et al. reported four new dihydrostilbenes in his review [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-02774" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These compounds are 3-[2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethyl]-5-methoxyphenol (
 <bold>142</bold>), 3-[2-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-ethyl]-5-methoxyphenol (
 <bold>143</bold>), 3-[2-(3-isoprenyl-4-hydroxy-5-methoxy-phenyl)-ethyl]-5-methoxyphenol (
 <bold>144</bold>) and canniprene (
 <bold>145</bold>). Their chemical structures were determined by chemical and spectral analysis, while the chemical structure of 
 <bold>145</bold> was confirmed by synthesis [
 <xref rid="B71-molecules-26-02774" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Two dihydrostilbenes, named cannabistilbene I (
 <bold>146</bold>) and cannabistibene II (
 <bold>147</bold>), were isolated from the polar acidic fraction of a Panamanian variant of 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> grown at the University of Mississippi. The chemical structure of cannabistilbene I (
 <bold>146</bold>) was elucidated as 3,4′-dihydroxy-5-methoxy-3′(3-methylbut-2-enyl)-dihydrostilbene by 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR and mass spectral analysis and confirmed by total synthesis. The chemical structure of cannabistilbene II (
 <bold>147</bold>) was proposed as either 
 <bold>147A</bold> or 
 <bold>147B</bold> based on spectral analysis [
 <xref rid="B76-molecules-26-02774" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. El-Feraly isolated 3,4′,5-trihydroxy-dihydrostilbene (
 <bold>148</bold>) from the ethanol extract of a hashish sample. The chemical structure of 
 <bold>148</bold> and its prepared triacetate were established by 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectroscopic analysis as well as total synthesis [
 <xref rid="B77-molecules-26-02774" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Recently, Guo et al. isolated three new prenylated stilbenes (
 <bold>149</bold>–
 <bold>151</bold>) and two other known stilbenes (
 <bold>152</bold>–
 <bold>153</bold>) from the leaves of 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> grown in Yunnan Province, China. The authors applied multiple chromatographic techniques in the isolation and purification of compounds 
 <bold>149</bold>–
 <bold>153</bold>, such as column chromatography over silica gel cc, ODS C
 <sub>18</sub> Si gel column chromatography, Sephadex column chromatography, and preparative HPLC. Spectral techniques such as 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy and HRESIMS were used to determine the chemical structures as α,α′-dihydro-3′,4,5′-trihydroxy-4′-methoxy-3-isopentenylstilbene (149), α,α′-dihydro-3,4′,5-trihydroxy-4-methoxy-2,6-diisopentenylstilbene (150), and α,α′-dihydro-3′,4,5′-trihydroxy-4′-methoxy-2′,3-diisopentenylstilbene (151), α,α′-dihydro-3,4′,5-trihydroxy-4,5′-diisopentenylstilbene (152) and combretastatin B-2 (153) [
