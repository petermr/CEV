<p>A year after cannabisativine was reported, the second spermidine alkaloid, namely anhydrocannabisativine (
 <bold>323</bold>), was isolated from the dry leaves and small stems of cannabis of the Mexican variety grown in Mississippi [
 <xref rid="B111-molecules-26-02774" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. The compound was isolated through a series of acidâ€“base extractions and silica-gel chromatography. The identity of the compound was proven by spectral data analysis and by the conversion of cannabisativine (
 <bold>322</bold>) to anhydrocannabisativine (
 <bold>323</bold>). In 1978, the spermidine alkaloid was isolated from the roots and leaves of a Mexican variant [

 <bold>322</bold>) in 15 different 
 <italic>Cannabis</italic> variants using TLC eluted with chloroform: acetone: ammonia (1:1:1) [
