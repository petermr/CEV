<p>Only two spermidine alkaloids (
 <bold>322</bold>–
 <bold>323</bold>) have been identified in 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02774-f018">Figure 18</xref>). In 1975, the first spermidine alkaloid was isolated from a methanolic extract of cannabis roots from a Mexican variant grown in Mississippi, and it was identified as cannabisativine (
 <bold>316</bold>) by X-ray crystallography [

 <xref rid="B110-molecules-26-02774" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. The ethanolic extract was extracted and acid–base partitioned, as well as subjected to column and thin-layer chromatography followed by crystallization of the alkaloid from acetone.
