<p>To date, there have been over 500 constituents of 
 <italic>Cannabis sativa</italic> reported, out of which 125 are identified to belong to the cannabinoid-type compounds, with five new cannabinoids reported in the last 2 years. The other non-cannabinoid-type compounds are classified into various chemical classes, including alkaloids, flavonoids, non-cannabinoid phenols, and terpenes. This review discusses the chemistry, identification, isolation, and structural elucidation of these major classes of compounds, to provide an overview of their chemical structures and to better understand the complexity of the chemical profile of 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic>.
