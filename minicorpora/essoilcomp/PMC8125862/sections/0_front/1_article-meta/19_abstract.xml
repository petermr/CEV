  <italic>Cannabis sativa</italic> is one of the oldest medicinal plants in the world. It was introduced into western medicine during the early 19th century. It contains a complex mixture of secondary metabolites, including cannabinoids and non-cannabinoid-type constituents. More than 500 compounds have been reported from 
  <italic>C. sativa</italic>, of which 125 cannabinoids have been isolated and/or identified as cannabinoids. Cannabinoids are C
  <sub>21</sub> terpeno-phenolic compounds specific to 
  <italic>Cannabis.</italic> The non-cannabinoid constituents include: non-cannabinoid phenols, flavonoids, terpenes, alkaloids and others. This review discusses the chemistry of the cannabinoids and major non-cannabinoid constituents (terpenes, non-cannabinoid phenolics, and alkaloids) with special emphasis on their chemical structures, methods of isolation, and identification.
