<p>To analyse the chemical compositions of the TTO and PMO, the GC-MS system (Agilent Technologies) equipped with gas chromatography (7890B) and mass spectrometer detector (5977A) (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) was used. Samples were diluted with hexane (1:19, 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>). The GC was equipped with an HP-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm internal diameter and 0.25 μm film thickness). Analyses were carried out using helium as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min at a split ratio of 1:10, injection volume of 1 µL and the following temperature program: 40 °C for 1 min; rising at 4 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> to 150 °C and held for 6 min; rising at 4 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> to 210 °C and held for 5 min. The injector and detector were held at 280 °C and 220 °C, respectively. Mass spectra were obtained by electron ionization (EI) at 70 eV; using a spectral range of m/z 40 to 550 and solvent delay of 3 min. The identification of different constituents was determined by comparing the spectrum fragmentation pattern with those stored in Wiley and NIST Mass Spectral Library data.
