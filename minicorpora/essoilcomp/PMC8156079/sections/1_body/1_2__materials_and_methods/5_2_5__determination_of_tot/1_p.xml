<p>The total sugar content was determined by the anthrone method at 630 nm as described in [
 <xref rid="B28-foods-10-01103" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Briefly, 200 mg fruit were extracted three times with ethanol (80%) at 80 Â°C. Then, the extracts were evaporated to dryness and redissolved in 2 mL distilled water. One millilitre of sample extracts was added to 1.5 mL of anthrone reagent (0.2% in H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>) and mixed thoroughly. The sample was brought to boil using a boiling water bath. The solution was cooled to room temperature and absorbance was measured. The formation of the blue-green complex indicates the presence of total sugars. Glucose was used as a standard. Vitamin C content was determined using the titrimetric method with 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol described by the Association of Official Analytical Chemistry [
