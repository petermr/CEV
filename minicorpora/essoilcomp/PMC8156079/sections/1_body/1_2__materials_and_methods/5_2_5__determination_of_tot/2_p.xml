<p>TPC was calculated by using the Folin–Ciocalteu reagent with some alteration by using gallic acid as a standard curve [
 <xref rid="B17-foods-10-01103" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Five grams of the sample was diluted using 5 mL of methanol (80%). The solution was blended with 2.5 mL of Folin–Ciocalteu (10-fold with distilled water) and added to 2.5 mL of distilled water. Afterwards, 2 mL of aqueous sodium carbonate solution (7.5%,

The absorption was assessed at 765 nm using the spectrophotometer, and the results were expressed as milligrams of gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per 100 mg of fresh fruit weight.
