<p>Green bean (
 <italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic>) belongs to the family of 
 <italic>Fabaceae</italic> and is considered one of the most important legume crops worldwide. The pods of green bean can be harvested at an immature stage (as a fresh vegetable) or mature stage (for dried seeds). Green bean is a rich source of minerals, vitamins, and dietary fibre that play a significant role in the human diet and wellbeing [

During postharvest, green beans are susceptible to mechanical damage, shriveling, chlorophyll pigment degradation, and increased fibre content [
