<p>To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is a novel investigation. There were no previous reports on the effect of ethanol, AsA, TTO, and PMO on postharvest behaviour and quality of green beans. The objective of the current study was to assess the effect of these natural compounds on the quality parameters and shelf life of fresh-cut green beans stored for 15 d at 5 °C.</p>
