<p>Due to rapid urbanisation in developing countries, demand for fresh minimally processed refrigerated fruit and vegetable has increased significantly. Minimal processing includes trimming, peeling, coring, cutting, and packing. These unit operations result in some undesirable morphological and physiological changes such as browning, pigmentations, and microbial growth. Additionally, the moisture loss and respiration rate of minimally processed vegetables are much higher during refrigerated storage compared to non-processed vegetables.</p>
