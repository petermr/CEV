<p>Appearance is the most important quality parameter for the consumer’s acceptance. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-01103-f003">Figure 3</xref> shows the appearance differences among treatments after 3 and 15 d from storage of green bean samples. It has been reported that the quality and acceptability of stored shredded carrots was maintained by exogenous AsA application [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-01103-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). This could be due to the inhibitory effects of AsA on chlorophyll degradation, ripening, and senescence. A sensory evaluation of the overall acceptability of the products, over time, and according to the proposed treatments, would be desirable. Our results shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-01103-f001">Figure 1</xref>A agree with a number of previous studies [

Exogenous application of PMO has been shown to retard ripening, maintain appearance and suppress the decay of Mangosteen fruit [
