<p>Previous works demonstrated the inhibited role of EOs and their several compounds for controlling human and plant pathogens [
 <xref rid="B4-foods-10-01103" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Our results in 
 <xref rid="foods-10-01103-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> show that both PMO and TTO had an inhibitory effect on microbial growth on the samples surface. The same trend was confirmed by previous work on dragon fruit [
 <xref rid="B12-foods-10-01103" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], where PMO inhibited the mould growth during storage for 21 d. It was found that TTO treatment suppressed the growth of the pathogens on the surface of strawberry fruit during refrigerated storage [
 <xref rid="B36-foods-10-01103" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], mostly due to inhibitory effects of the main chemical compositions of PMO such as Levomenthol [
 <xref rid="B63-foods-10-01103" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] and TTO such as 4-Terpinenol [
 <xref rid="B64-foods-10-01103" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] against microbial growth (
