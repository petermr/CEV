<p>Controlling postharvest diseases by ethanol application has been tested by various previous reports; e.g., 
 <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> was controlled in table grape [

 <xref rid="B18-foods-10-01103" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The reduced fungal growth in samples treated by ethanol is due to its striking lethal interactions with fungal spore that occurred in the mitochondrial membrane [
