<p>Weight loss of fresh fruit and vegetables during cold storage is affected by factors such as the structure of the cuticle [

 <xref rid="B17-foods-10-01103" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Our results agree with Jin et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-foods-10-01103" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], who reported a gradual decrease of water loss in sweet melon treated with vapour ethanol stored at 23 Â°C for 19 d. The reduced weight loss of the green bean samples by the 1% ethanol treatment could be attributed to the inhibitory effects on ethylene biosynthesis resulting in a decrease respiration process [
 <xref rid="B22-foods-10-01103" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Previously, Ali et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-foods-10-01103" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] reported a considerable decrease in the weight loss of litchi fruit treated by AsA compared to untreated samples. They suggested that AsA treatment reduced senescence and metabolic activity, which leads to a reduction of weight loss.
