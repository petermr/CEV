<p>In this study, either ethanol or AsA slowed the reduction of total sugar during cool storage (

Another study indicated that treatment with AsA inhibited the reduction of the sugars content in strawberry fruit during cold storage [
 <xref rid="B58-foods-10-01103" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. This result could be due to the reduction of PAL activity by AsA treatment resulting in a lower loss of sugars during storage [

 <xref rid="B53-foods-10-01103" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Our results agree with previous work, where a reduction in total sugar loss was recorded in mushrooms treated after harvest with PMO compared to control [
