<p>It is well known that TPC are considered the most important antioxidant compounds, responsible for scavenging free radicals, resulting in higher antioxidant defense [

 <xref rid="B18-foods-10-01103" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], who reported that TPC in loquat fruit increased at the beginning of storage and then decreased during the end of storage. In this study, ethanol and AsA treatments conserved the TPC of samples during storage. Additionally, it has been reported that that TPC in mung bean sprouts and litchi fruit was increased by AsA treatment, respectively [
