<p>Treatment with either ethanol or PMO resulted in a higher TSS in green bean samples compared to control (

 <xref rid="B18-foods-10-01103" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] observed a higher TSS content in loquat fruit treated with ethanol compared with the control. Additionally, our results agree with early work reporting a gradual increase in TSS in mangosteen fruit treated [
 <xref rid="B37-foods-10-01103" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] with PMO. Higher retention of TSS in samples treated with PMO can be related to the reduction of evaporation transpiration and respiration rate leading to conserving TSS [
