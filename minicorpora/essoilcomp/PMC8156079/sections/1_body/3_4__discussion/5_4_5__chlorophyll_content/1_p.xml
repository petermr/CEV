<p>It has been confirmed that ethanol retards chlorophyll degradation [

 <xref rid="B46-foods-10-01103" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The maintained chlorophyll content of the samples treated with ethanol is due to its inhibited effects on the activities and gene expression of chlorophyll enzymes [
 <xref rid="B21-foods-10-01103" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It has been reported that AsA reduced the degradation of chlorophyll, which is correlated to photosystem and therefore resulted in higher chlorophyll content [
 <xref rid="B47-foods-10-01103" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Our results shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-01103-f001">Figure 1</xref>d are in concurrence with Barzegar et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-foods-10-01103" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], who found that AsA treatment maintained chlorophyll content in stored sweet pepper and green chilies, respectively.
