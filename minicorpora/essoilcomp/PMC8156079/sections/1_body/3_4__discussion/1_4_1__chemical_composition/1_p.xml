<p>The chemical composition of EOs agreed with Wu et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-foods-10-01103" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], who stated that PMO mostly composed of monoterpenes and their derivatives. Vasile et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-foods-10-01103" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] showed previously that the TTO contained both light monoterpenes and numerous sesquiterpenes, which are represented as the main component in 4-terpineol, followed by Alpha-Terpinene and Gamma-Terpinene. These were some of the important constituents of PMO and TTO in our results.
