<p>Our results indicated that PMO had higher radical scavenging activity than the results reported by others [
 <xref rid="B25-foods-10-01103" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] who found that IC50 was recorded at 500 µL mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, which is a very high concentration compared to the concentration used in this study (50 µL mL
 <sup>−1</sup>). Variations in the antioxidant potential of EOs have been reported, primarily due to the presence of conjugated double bond compounds, which serve as hydrogen/electron donors [
