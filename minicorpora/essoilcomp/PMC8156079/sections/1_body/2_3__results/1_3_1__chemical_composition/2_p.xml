<p>In this study, the free-radical scavenging activity of PMO and TTO were assessed through the DPPH radical scavenging test. The radical scavenging activity was observed in EOs at the concentration of 50 µL mL
 <sup>−1</sup> for each PMO and TTO. PMO had lower radical scavenging activity (54%) compared to TTO (63.56%).
