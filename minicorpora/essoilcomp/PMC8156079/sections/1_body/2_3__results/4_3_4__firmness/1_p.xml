<p>A reduction in firmness was observed for all the samples with increasing storage period (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-foods-10-01103">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). There was no difference in firmness between samples treated with ethanol and the control during storage periods except after 9 d of storage (

Moreover, treatments with AsA, PMO and TTO were equally effective in maintaining firmness at higher levels than controls from day 9 and thereafter. It was also shown that no difference was observed in firmness between treatments with TTO and PMO and the control only after three and six days of storage (
