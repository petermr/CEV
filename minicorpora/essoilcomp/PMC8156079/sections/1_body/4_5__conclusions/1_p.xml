<p>Our study suggested that ethanol, AsA, PMO, and TTO can extend the life of fresh-cut green beans pods under refrigerated conditions by reducing weight loss and maintaining appearance, chlorophyll content, firmness, vitamin C, TSS, total sugar, and TPC. Moreover, a reduction in the mould and yeast count and total microbial count during storage was observed. Ethanol was the most effective application, followed by PMO and TTO, for preserving quality during refrigerated storage at 5 Â°C up to 15 d. Although all the treatments had positive effects, the best treatment shall be selected based on particular requirement and economic feasibility. For example, if there is a problem of higher microbial load along the value chain, we recommend the use of ethanol as it was the most effective, followed by PMP, TTO. Moreover, further research is required to enhance the storage ability of fresh-cut green beans and other legume crops including peas and board bean.</p>
