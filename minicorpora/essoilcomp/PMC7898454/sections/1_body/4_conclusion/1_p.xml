<p id="Par51">In this study, the chemical composition of the essential oils extracted from 
 <italic>E. umbellata</italic> fruit was determined. Out of the detected compounds (through GC-MS analysis), 68 were identified. As a rich source of valuable phytochemicals the extracted oils demonstrated antioxidant, anticholinesterase, and antidiabetic activities. The essential oil of this plant could therefore be used as alternative drug to treat oxidative stress related diseases. However, further studies are needed to identify the responsible compounds and test them individually for the observed biological potentials in in vitro and in vivo. Toxicological aspects and bioavailability evaluations of them are also important and needs to be evaluated.
