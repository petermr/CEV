<p id="Par44">Plant and their products are used by human as important health remedies since time immemorial. Plants are considered to be the natural product factories as they are self-nourished that also have the capabilities to cope with uneven situations. In uneven situation they produce certain chemical called secondary metabolites which are used as tool of offence and defence. Most of these metabolites contain phenolic rings and are natural antioxidants. There is need to isolate them in pure state which would leads to the development of novel drugs [

Natural antioxidants are potentially safe as they have limited side effects, efficient in term of their efficacies and inexpensive as they are obtained from renewable sources. Epidemiologically a relation has been established between plant antioxidants and reduction in a number of certain chronic disorders [
