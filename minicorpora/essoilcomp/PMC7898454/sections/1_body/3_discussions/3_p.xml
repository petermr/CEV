<p id="Par45">Natural antioxidants, usually belongs to phenolic and flavonoid categories of phytochemicals. However, it should be noted that flavonoids are larger compounds and are usually not present in essential oils. At the same time phenolic are also very few in them. There are many volatile components in such samples responsible for the antioxidant activities (described below). 
 <italic>E. umbellata</italic> is the least explored plant. Although antibacterial, anti-fungal, insecticidal, phytotoxic activities, free radical scavenging, antidiabetic, and anti-amnesic activity has been reported [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], but essential oil of fruit has not been investigated yet. Substantial DPPH and ABTS free radical scavenging activities were observed for the extracted oil which may be due to the chemical constituents as indicated in GC-MS results (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). The octadecanoic acid has been reported with significant antioxidant potential [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Similarly, the 
 <italic>cis-cis</italic>-9,12-Octadecadienoic acid which is commonly known as linoleic acid is an antioxidant compound [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Likewise the α-linolenic acid [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and 3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-2-hexadecen-1-ol (Phytol) reportedly possess free radicals scavenging potential [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Humulene epoxide is also a moderate antioxidant [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The 2-Mwthoxy-4-vinylphenol i.e., p-Vinylguaiacol is a significant radical scavenger [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. As far as the (+)-ascorbic acid 2,6- dihexadecanoate is concerned, this is used as a reference standard in free radicals scavenging activities [
