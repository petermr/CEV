<p id="Par48">Our previously reported data on 
 <italic>E. umbellata</italic> verifies its antioxidant, antidiabetic, anticholinesterase, and neuroprotective potentials [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Some of the compounds present in the essential oil of 
 <italic>E. umbellata</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) have already been confirmed to possess neuroprotective activities for instance, the 
 <italic>cis-cis</italic>-9,12-Octadecadienoic acid (Linoleic acid) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. In the same manner α-linolenic acid [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], caryophyllene [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], octadecanoic acid (stearic acid) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], and decanoic acid have been recently reported to have strong neuroprotective activities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Although a number of chemical compounds are present in the essential oil of 
 <italic>E. umbellata</italic>, the most active compounds responsible for the observed biological activities were nominated based on reported studies in literature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].
