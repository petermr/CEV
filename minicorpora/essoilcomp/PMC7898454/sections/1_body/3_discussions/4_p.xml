<p id="Par46">The inhibitors of carbohydrate digesting enzymes, α-glucosidase and α-amylase prevent the absorption of dietary starch and decrease the postprandial glucose level. Efficient inhibitors are needed to inhibit them in diabetes mellitus to keep in control the blood glucose level. The observed antidiabetic potential of 
 <italic>E. umbellata</italic> fruit essential oil may be due to the presence of important constituents as indicated in the Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>. The antidiabetic activities of α-linolenic acid (identified in the GC-MS analysis of 
 <italic>E. umbellata</italic>), has been previously reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The 3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-2-hexadecen-1-ol which is also known as phytol have been reported to have strong antidiabetic potential [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Similarly, the octadecanoic acid or steric acid also possess antidiabetic potential [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The humulene epoxide also have the capacity to lower the blood glucose level [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], and the (+)-ascorbic acid 2,6-dihexadecanoate is one of the component of the essential oil of 
 <italic>E. umbellata</italic>, which has been reported to possess antidiabetic potential [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The essential oil inhibited α-glucosidase and α-amylase efficiently and the results were comparable with acarbose a standard inhibitor of these enzymes that inhibited both of them with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 28 and 30 μg/mL respectively.
