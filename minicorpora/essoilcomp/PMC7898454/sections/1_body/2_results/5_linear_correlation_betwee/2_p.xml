<p id="Par42">Similarly, the regression value of %AChE inhibition by essential oil sample and standard is 0.971 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c) while in case of BChE (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>d) it is 0.9148. The acetyl cholinesterase and butyryl cholinesterase inhibition potential shown by essential oil sample of 
 <italic>E. umbellata</italic> were comparable with that of positive control galantamine which is also obvious from the correlation coefficient values. The regression value for % α-glucosidase and α-amylase inhibition by essential oil sample (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>e, f) vs standard acarbose were 0.9423 and 0.9351 respectively. From the regression values it was concluded that essential oil have comparable antioxidant, anticholinesterase, and antidiabetic capabilities in comparison to used standards.
