<p id="Par39">The anticholinesterase potential of essential oil has been summarized in the Table S
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> (Supplementary file). The observed anticholinesterase potential is probably due to the presence of active chemical constituents (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Essential oil demonstrated 85.44, 78.07, 71.86 67.59, 54.37, and 47.37% AChE inhibition at 1000, 500, 250, 125, 62.5, and 31.05 μg/mL concentrations respectively with IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 48 μg/mL (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). Similarly, the %BChE inhibition recorded were; 81.45, 76.08, 67.13, 56.82, 44.11, and 40.66 at 1000, 500, 250, 125, and 62.5 μg/mL concentrations respectively with IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 90 μg/mL (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). The anticholinesterase potential of essential oil was comparable with the positive control galantamine (AChE IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 25 μg/mL) and (BChE IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 30 μg/mL).
