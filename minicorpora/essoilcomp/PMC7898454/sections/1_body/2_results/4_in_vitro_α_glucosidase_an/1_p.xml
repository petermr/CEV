 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref> (Supplementary file). The % α-glucosidase inhibition potential of essential oil sample observed were; 75.25, 69.61, 60.56, 52.51, 32.74, and 30.61 at 1000, 500, 250, 125, 62.5, and 31.05 μg/mL concentrations respectively with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 120 μg/mL (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). The %α-amylase enzyme inhibition potentials were; 88.30, 79.85, 74.82, 52.51, 41.39, and 36.24 at 1000, 500, 250, 125, 62.5, 31.05 μg/mL concentrations with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 110 μg/mL respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). Acarbose a standard inhibitor of α-glucosidase and α-amylase produced an IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 28 and 30 μg/mL respectively against the selected enzymes.
