<p id="Par38">The observed free radicals scavenging potential of essential oil sample of 
 <italic>E. umbellata</italic> estimated through DPPH and ABTS assays, was significant and comparable with that of the positive control ascorbic acid. The highest percent scavenging potential observed were; 85.24 ± 0.63, 88.30 ± 0.81 respectively against DPPH (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a) and ABTS (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b) at the highest concentration of 1000 μg/mL with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 70 and 105 μg/mL respectively. The standard ascorbic acid caused an inhibition of 91.56 ± 0.35 and 92.63 ± 0.99% against DPPH and ABTS at the highest concentration 1000 μg/mL with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 32 and 29 μg/mL respectively.
