<p id="Par23">Berry fruits are rich sources of phenolic compounds. Among berry fruit plants, 
 <italic>Elaeagnus umbellata</italic> Thunb. is a member of the 
 <italic>Elaeagnaceae</italic> family with a high medicinal value that is native to Southern Europe and Central Asia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It is abundantly found in Himalayan regions of Pakistan as well [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The 
 <italic>Elaeagnus species</italic> are traditionally used as antioxidant, anticancer, antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory, anti-mutagenic, anti-ulcerogenic, antimicrobial, antidiabetic, and neuroprotective agents [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Previously we have evaluated the antioxidant, antidiabetic, and anticholinesterase potential of different extracts and isolated compounds (rutin, epigallocatechin gallate, epigallocatechin, quercetin, morin, ellagic acid, catechin, chlorogenic acid, and pyrogallol) of 
 <italic>E. umbellata</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The floral volatiles and biological activities of 
 <italic>E. umbellata</italic> and 
 <italic>E. angustifolia L.</italic> have been reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A review of the literature revealed that no previous studies have been performed on the essential oil of fruit of 
 <italic>E. umbellata.</italic>
