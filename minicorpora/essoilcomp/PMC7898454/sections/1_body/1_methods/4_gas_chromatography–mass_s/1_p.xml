<p id="Par28">Essential oil of 
 <italic>E. umbellata</italic> were analysed by means of an Agilent USB-393752 gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The instrument have the arrangement to effectively vaporizes the sample (the gas phase) and separates its various components using HP-5MS 5% phenyl methyl siloxane capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm film thickness; Restek, Bellefonte, PA) and was equipped with an FID detector for phytoconstituents identification. The oven temperature was set first at 70 °C for 1 min, and then increased to 180 °C at the rate of 6 °C/min for 5 min and lastly to 280 °C for 20 min at the rate of 5 °C/min. Injector temperature was set at 220 °C while detector temperatures was set at 290 °C. The diluted samples (1/1000 in 
 <italic>n</italic>-pentane, v/v) having volume 1 μL were injected manually in the split-less mode. Helium (49.6 psi) was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min which propelled the compounds and also act as reagent gas that causes charge-exchange chemical ionization of the analytes which are then separated on the basis of mass-to-charge (
 <italic>m/z</italic>) ratios. These components are then identified through comparison with known standards in literature [
