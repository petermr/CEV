<p id="Par36">All the experiments were performed in three replicates. Two way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni Post-test (to determine the values of P) were applied to establish the statistical differences between standard drug and test samples using Graph Pad Prism software. The results were represented as Mean ± SEM. The results for which

 <sub>50</sub>) of DPPH, ABTS, AChE, BChE, α-glucosidase, and α-amylase enzyme were determined using linear regression analysis using MS Excel program 2007. R
 <sup>2</sup> values that were used to establish correlation between the biological potentials (antioxidant and inhibition of AChE, BChE, α-glucosidase, and α-amylase) of essential oil samples and the respective standards used in the study, were calculated using Excel 2007.
