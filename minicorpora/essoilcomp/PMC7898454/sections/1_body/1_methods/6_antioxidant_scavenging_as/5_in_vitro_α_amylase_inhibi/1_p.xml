 <sub>4</sub> buffer and 0.006 M NaCl at pH 6.9. The stock solution of essential oil was serially diluted in the range of 31.05–1000 μg/mL. Then 200 μL of α-amylase (2 units/mL) solution was mixed with 200 μL essential oil and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. Subsequently 200 μL starch (1% in water; w/v) solution was added to each dilution following incubation for 3 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 200 μL sodium potassium tartrate tetrahydrate dissolved in 8 mL NaOH (2 M) and 20 mL 3, 5 dinitrosalicylicacid (96 mM). The mixture was boiled for 10 min in a water bath at 85–90 °C. After cooling the mixture was diluted with 5 mL distilled water. The absorbance was recorded at 540 nm using UV-visible spectrophotometer. A blank solution was prepared containing only essential oil but no enzyme. Standard acarbose (2–100 μg/mL) was used as positive control. The same procedure mentioned above was used to prepare reaction mixture of positive control and absorbance was measured at 540 nm. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of essential oil sample were calculated by plotting % α-amylase inhibition as a function of concentration. The α-amylase enzyme inhibition potential was calculated using the eq.
