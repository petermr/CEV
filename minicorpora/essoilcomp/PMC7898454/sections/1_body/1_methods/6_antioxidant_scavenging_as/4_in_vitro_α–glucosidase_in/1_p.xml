<p id="Par34">The α-glucosidase inhibition potential of essential oil of 
 <italic>E. umbellata</italic> were evaluated according to the reported assay [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] with some modifications. The reaction mixture was formulated by adding 100 μL of α-glucosidase (0.5 unit/mL), 600 μL of phosphate buffer (0.1 M; pH 6.9) and 50 μL of essential oil dilutions (31.05, 62.5, 125, 250, 500 and 1000 μg/mL). To initiate the reaction 100 μL 
 <italic>p</italic>-nitro-phenyl-α-D-glucopyranoside (5 mM) solution was added into each reaction mixture. The resulting mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Then the reaction was stopped by the addition of 400 μL sodium carbonate (0.2 M) solution and the absorbance of mixture was recorded at 405 nm. Acarbose (2–100 μg/mL) was used as positive control. The reaction mixture with no essential oil was used as a negative control while the blank solution was prepared without α-glucosidase. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of essential oil sample were calculated by plotting % α-glucosidase inhibition as a function of concentration. The % α-glucosidase inhibition potential was calculated using following equation.
