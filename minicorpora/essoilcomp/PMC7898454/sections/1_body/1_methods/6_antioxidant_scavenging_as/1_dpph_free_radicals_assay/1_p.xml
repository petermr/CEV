<p id="Par31">Brand-Williams assay [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] was used with some modification to check the scavenging potential of essential oil of 
 <italic>E. umbellata</italic> against DPPH (2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) free radical. To prepare DPPH solution, 24 mg of it were dissolved in 100 mL methanol. Approximately, 1 mg/mL stock solution of essential oil was also prepared in methanol and serially diluted to obtain the dilution having concentrations; 1000, 500, 250, 125, 62.5 and 31.05 μg/mL. Subsequently 0.1 mL of each dilution was mixed with 3 mL of DPPH solution. The mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. Absorbance was measured at wave length 517 nm through UV spectrophotometer (Thermo Electron Corporation; USA) and ascorbic acid was used as a positive control. All the samples were analysed in triplicates and the results are presented as Mean ± SEM. Percent DPPH scavenging potential was calculated using the following equation:
