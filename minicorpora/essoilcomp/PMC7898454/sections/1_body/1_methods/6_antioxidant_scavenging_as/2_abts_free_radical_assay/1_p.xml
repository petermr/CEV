<p id="Par32">The 2,2′-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) free radicals scavenging potential of essential oil was determined using the reported standard protocol [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. ABTS (7 mM) solution was thoroughly mixed with potassium persulfate (2.45 mM) solutions. The mixture was incubated overnight in dark for the production of free radicals. After that absorption of a 3 mL volume from it was adjusted at 745 nm to 0.7 through adding methanol (50%). About 300 μL of test samples were mixed with 3 mL ABTS solution and incubated for 6 min. The absorbance of mixtures were noted using UV spectrophotometer. Standard ascorbic acid was used as positive control. All the test samples were analysed in 3 replicates and percent ABTS scavenging potential was calculated using eq.
