  <title>Background</title>
  <p id="Par1">
   <italic>Elaeagnus umbellata</italic> Thunb. (autumn olive) is a high valued medicinal plant. It belongs to 
   <italic>Elaeagnaceae</italic> family and is widely distributed in Himalayan regions of Pakistan. In the present study essential oil were extracted from the fruit of this plant and their antioxidant, anticholinesterase and antidiabetic potentials were also evaluated.

  <title>Methods</title>
  <p id="Par2">Essential oils were extracted from the fruit of 
   <italic>E. umbellata</italic> using hydro-distillation method and were characterized by GC-MS. The extracted oil were tested for its antioxidant, anticholinesterase, and antidiabetic potentials using standard protocols.

  <title>Results</title>
  <p id="Par3">About 68 compounds were identified by GC-MS. The extracted oil exhibited a fairly high free radical scavenging activities against DPPH and ABTS radicals with IC
   <sub>50</sub> values of 70 and 105 μg/mL respectively (for ascorbic acid, used as standard, the IC
   <sub>50</sub> values were 32 and 29 μg/mL, respectively against the mentioned radicals). The essential oil also exhibited anticholinesterase activities with IC
   <sub>50</sub> values of 48 and 90 μg/mL respectively against AChE and BChE (for galantamine used as standard, the IC
   <sub>50</sub> values were 25 and 30 μg/mL respectively). The essential oil also exhibited antidiabetic potential with IC
   <sub>50</sub> values of 120 and 110 μg/mL respectively against α-glucosidase and α-amylase (IC
   <sub>50</sub> values for standard acarbose = 28 and 30 μg/mL respectively).

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p id="Par4">Essential oil extracted from the fruits of 
   <italic>E. umbellata</italic> exhibited reasonable antioxidant, anticholinesterase, and antidiabetic potentials that could be used as alternative medicine in treating diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders. However, further studies are needed to isolate responsible compounds and evaluate the observed potential in animal models.
