<p>GC-MS analysis showed that EEO was mainly composed of oxygen-containing monolithic compounds. In addition, the essential oil showed a certain ability on scavenging free radicals and could be used as a potential antioxidant. EEO possessed a strong antibacterial activity, which could effectively inhibit a variety of bacteria and plant pathogenic fungi, especially 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> and 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic>, indicating EEO had a broad application prospects in food and pharmaceutical products. Essential oil from 
 <italic>E. grandis Ã— E. urophylla</italic> had a clear phytotoxic effect. The significant antibacterial as well as phytotoxic capacities were conducive to more research studies and development in the direction of biological pesticides. Nevertheless, further investigations will be carried out to evaluate the antibacterial mechanism, as the essential oil could be applied to food and pharmaceutical products.
