<p>As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-01450-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, EEO could completely inhibit the seven strains when the concentration reached 40 mg/mL. When the concentration was 20 mg/mL, EEO could completely suppress the growth of six strains except 
 <italic>F. graminearum</italic> with an inhibitory rate of 61.52 ± 1.84%. 
 <italic>E. grandis × E. urophylla</italic> essential oil (EEO) still exhibited a good inhibitory effect on plant pathogens (14.52%–100%) with the concentration below 10 mg/mL, especially 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic> followed by 
 <italic>B. cinerea</italic>. Liu et al. found terpenes played a key role in the inhibitory effects of 
 <italic>E. grandis × E. urophylla</italic> oil on 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic>, 
 <italic>Pyriculerie grisea</italic>, 
 <italic>Glorosprium musarum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Phytophthora capsici</italic> [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-01450" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Zhou et al. found the essential oil extracted by supercritical CO
 <sub>2</sub> method from 
 <italic>E. grandis × E. urophylla</italic> leaves exhibited a great antifungal effect on 11 plant pathogenic fungi, such as 
 <italic>Fusarium moniliforme</italic>, 
 <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Magnaporthe grisea</italic> [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-26-01450" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. These were in agreement with the results of our paper that EEO had broad-spectrum inhibitory effects to many fungi so that it could become a potential for biological pesticide.
