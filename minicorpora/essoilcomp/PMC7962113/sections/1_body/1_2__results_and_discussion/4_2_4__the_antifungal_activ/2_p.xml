<p>Anthracnose was an infection of 
 <italic>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</italic> and was a significant pathogen implicated in many diseases of fruits and crops in many countries and regions around the world. Essential oil extracted from 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> leaves have been proven to possess a significant inhibitory effect on a variety of plant pathogens including 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic> [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-26-01450" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Essential oils from three 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> (
 <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> Dehn, 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic> Labill, and 
 <italic>E. tereticornis</italic> Smith) in Colombia were also proven to have a good inhibition effect on 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic> when the concentration was higher than 2.5 mg/mL [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-26-01450" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], which were in agreement with our results. Chang et al. found the fungicidal activity of limonene, α and β-pinene against 
 <italic>F. solani</italic> and 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic> [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-26-01450" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Terpene-4-ol and α-terpineol could effectively inhibit the mycelium growth and spore germination [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-01450" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. α-terpineol had been reported to have antimicrobial properties and to enhance the permeability of skin to lipid-soluble compounds widely used in aromatherapy and folk medicine [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-01450" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-26-01450" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The antifungal activity of globulol against the fungus 
 <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> had been determined [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-26-01450" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. 
 <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> oil presented higher antifungal activity over 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioide</italic> than 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic> oil and it had a higher level of globulol than 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic> oil [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-26-01450" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. EEO contained a certain level of α-pinene, globulol, and α-terpineol. Therefore, we speculated that those components play a significant role in antifungal activity of EEO.
