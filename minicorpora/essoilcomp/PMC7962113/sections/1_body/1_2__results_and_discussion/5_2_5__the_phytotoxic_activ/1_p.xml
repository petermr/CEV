<p>Statistical significance in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01450-f002">Figure 2</xref> was evaluated by one-way ANOVA, which was followed by the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test. The results show that EEO had certain phytotoxic potential, especially for four kinds of tested seeds. The germination rate, germination force, and germination index of the three seeds (
 <italic>R. sativus</italic>, 
 <italic>L. sativa</italic>, and 
 <italic>L. perenne</italic>) decreased with the increase of the concentration of EEO (0.125–2 mg/mL) among which the seed of 
 <italic>L. perenne</italic> was the most sensitive to EEO. The inhibitory effect on seed of 
 <italic>B. pilosa</italic> increased first and then decreased with the increase of concentration of EEO. It was the strongest when the concentration of EEO was 0.5 mg/mL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01450-f002">Figure 2</xref>A–C). EEO showed a certain inhibition in seedling height (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01450-f002">Figure 2</xref>D). The length of the main root of 
 <italic>R. sativus</italic> and 
 <italic>L. perenne</italic> were significantly suppressed after treatment with a different concentration of EEO. However, EEO showed no significant effect on the main root of 
 <italic>R. sativus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. pilosa</italic>. All main root lengths of four seeds were shorter than that of the blank group, indicating EEO could restrain the growth of roots (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01450-f002">Figure 2</xref>E). EEO has good phytotoxicity, which may slow down the use of traditional herbicides.
