<p>Abrahim et al. found that α-pinene strongly inhibited mitochondrial ATP production of maize seedlings [

 <italic>Lepidium sativum</italic> were inhibited by α-pinene [

 <xref rid="B49-molecules-26-01450" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Although some of the components have a good phytotoxic effect, the phytotoxicity of EEO was likely to owe to the synergistic action of different monoterpenes. Whether the observed phytotoxicity effect of EEO was attributable to a single compound or to the synergistic effects of several compounds need to be investigated further.
