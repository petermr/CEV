<p>Numerous studies demonstrated that essential oil extracted from 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> leaves had been proven to possess a significant inhibitory effect on bacteria. In addition, 1,8-cineole was considered important for their antibacterial effects. 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic> essential oil had a rather remarkable antimicrobial activity (MIC = 0.09–3.13 mg/mL), especially against 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and most of which were 1,8-cineole (85.82%) and α-pinene (7.16%) [

 <italic>E. globulus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. urograndis</italic> could be used to inhibit planktonic cells and biofilm of 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic> with inhibition zones ranging from 14.7 ± 1.2 mm to 35.3 ± 0.3 mm. The inhibiting effect was related to 1,8-cineole [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-26-01450" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. 1,8-cineole was the major compound in the seven kinds of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> essential oil (49.07 to 83.59%) and their diameter of the inhibition zone was 10 to 29 mm, especially the essential oils from 
 <italic>E. maideni</italic>, 
 <italic>E. astrengens</italic>, 
 <italic>E. cinerea</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. bicostata</italic> that showed the highest antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>Listeria ivanovii</italic> and 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-01450" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Although some studies showed 1,8-cineole offered a positive effect against bacteria, a few studies showed there is no certain relationship yet. Cimanga concluded no correlation between the content of major constituents such as 1,8-cineole, α-pinene, and the antibacterial activity [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-01450" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The oils of 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic>, 
 <italic>E. radiata</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. citriodora</italic> mainly containing 1,8-cineole (more than 82.66%) were hardly against Gram-negative bacteria [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-01450" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In this present work, the content of 1,8-cineole in EEO was very low, while EEO had a strong bacteriostatic effect. Hence, 1,8-cineole could not be the vital composition. It can be seen that other components play a key role in a bacteriostatic effect. The antimicrobial activity of α-terpineol, terpinene-4-ol, and α-pinene had been reported [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-26-01450" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-01450" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-26-01450" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Therefore, the antibacterial activity of EEO may be due to these terpenes and the cooperative action of them.
