<p>As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-01450-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, EEO exhibited a great inhibition ability on the six tested-strains. The diameter of the inhibition zone for each bacterium was between 14.33–18.11 mm. The inhibition zone against 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> was the largest (18.11 ± 0.19 mm) while the inhibition zone on 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> was the smallest (14.33 ± 0.33 mm). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of EEO on strains ranged from 0.023 to 0.091 mg/mL and all the MBC values were 10 mg/mL. A small value of MIC meant an excellent antibacterial effect. Hence, the outcomes demonstrated EEO possessed a strong bacteriostatic ability and the activity against Gram-negative bacteria was higher than against Gram-positive bacteria.
