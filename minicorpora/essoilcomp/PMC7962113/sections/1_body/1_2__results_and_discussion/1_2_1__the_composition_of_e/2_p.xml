<p>Eucalyptol is the essential component of most 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> plants. However, the main components of essential oil we had obtained were different from those of other varieties, even the hybrid parents. Elaissi analyzed the composition of 20 kinds of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> essential oils in Northern and Northwestern Tunisia and found oxygen-containing monoterpenoids were the main content of these 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> oil while the highest compound in 
 <italic>E. grandis</italic> oil was 1,8-cineole (15.9%) and p-cymene (11.1%) [

 <italic>E. grandis’</italic>s major components were α-pinene (52.71%) and 1,8-cineole (18.38%) in Argentina [

 <italic>E.urophylla</italic> oil [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-01450" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Those 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> distributed in different regions. Hence, varieties and regions may affect the chemical compositions in oils from 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic>. In addition, a remarkable difference was found between our work and that of other regions or extraction methods. Liu et al. found that the main constituents of EEO collected in Hainan (China) were alloocimene (43.22%) and α-pinene (13.63%) [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-01450" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The principal constituents of EEO were α-pinene (24.78%) and 1,8-cineole (45.57%), which was collected from three-year-old leaves and was extracted for 8 h at 80 °C by a supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) system using CO
 <sub>2</sub> [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-01450" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. But 1,8-cineole content of EEO in our study was extremely low at only 1.35%. This may be explained by 1,8-cineole, α-pinene, limonene, and α-terpineol transformed from the same substrate [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-01450" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Different extraction methods led to a substrate conversion to the other three compositions. Therefore, the difference between our study and previous studies may be due to various differences in variety, genetic differences caused by generations and hybridizations, growing environment, extraction method, and even growing years and season of harvesting.
