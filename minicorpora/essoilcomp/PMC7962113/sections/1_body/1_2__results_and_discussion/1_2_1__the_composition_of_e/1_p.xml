 <xref rid="molecules-26-01450-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Twenty-seven compounds were identified, corresponding to 97.42% of the total essential oil. Monoterpenes were dominant in 
 <italic>E. grandis × E. urophylla</italic> essential oil (EEO) (67.34%), of which the oxygenated monoterpenes have the most important proportions (32.45%). In addition, sesquiterpene (30.92%) is the main component of EEO. α-pinene (17.02%), α-terpineol (13.63%), aromadendrene (11.08%), 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene and (8.47%), and endo-borneol (7.77%) are the major compounds for EEO.
