<p>It was reported that the antioxidant activity of the

 <italic>E. citriodora</italic> leaves contain monoterpenoid-rich oil like citronellal (60.66%), exhibiting strong antioxidant activity [

 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> essential oil was composed mainly of oxygenated ones (67.8%), monoterpenes (12.2%), and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (4.9%), which had a moderate activity compared to phenolics and Vc [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-01450" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The percentage of monoterpenes hydrocarbons was 22.8%, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons was 16.8%, and oxygenated monoterpenes was 35.2%. Additionally, a component of 1,8-cineole in the essential oil leaves had been reported to possess potent antioxidant activity [

 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-01450" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], but it was also reported that limonene showed a weak or null effect as a scavenger of DPPH and ABTS radicals [
