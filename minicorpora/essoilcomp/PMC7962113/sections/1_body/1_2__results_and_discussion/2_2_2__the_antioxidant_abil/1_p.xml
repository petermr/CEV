<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01450-f001">Figure 1</xref>, EEO exhibited certain antioxidant ability in vitro. EEO could well scavenge 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radicals with a maximum scavenging rate of 50% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01450-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). EEO showed an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 42.5 mg/mL according to our DPPH assay and was powerful than 
 <italic>E. oleosa</italic> essential oil (IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 52.8 mg/mL) [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-26-01450" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. EEO also effectively cleared 2, 2’-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) free radicals, the maximal eliminating ratio was 80%, and the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value was 7.4 mg/mL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01450-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). The ABTS activity obtained for EEO (IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 7.4 mg/mL) was also more powerful than the oil of 
 <italic>E. salubris</italic> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 273.2 ± 4.1 mg/mL). ABTS radical scavenging ability of EEO was better than its DPPH radical scavenging ability. Comparing the results of the ABTS assay to those of the DPPH one, we could deduce that the ABTS assay generally presented more activity. It could be inferred from the above results that the ABTS assay usually shows more activity than those of the DPPH one. This result may be because ABTS was in aqueous solution and is cationic radical while DPPH in methanol solvent was neutrally radical. Although 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> leaves essential oil showed certain antioxidant capacity, it was still far from the commonly used antioxidant vitamin C (Vc).
