<p>Therefore, the essential oil from the leaves of 
 <italic>E. grandis Ã— E. urophylla</italic> was extracted by steam distillation, and its composition was investigated by GC-MS. Moreover, the biological activity potential of EEO has been evaluated firstly and systemically. The antioxidant activity was evaluated by determining the scavenging ability on free radicals. In addition, the antibacterial activity was assessed by measuring the inhibition zones, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC). The antifungal capacity and phytotoxic activity on several weed seeds were also rated in the expectation that the essential oil will be beneficial for the fields of food, medicine, and botanical pesticides.
