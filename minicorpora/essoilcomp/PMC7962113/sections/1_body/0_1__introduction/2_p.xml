 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> was the conventional name of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> of the genus 
 <italic>Myrtaceae</italic> family. It was native to Australia and was one of the most widely cultivated genera in the world [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-26-01450" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> had been widely used in plywood, pulp, and solid wood production, as well its essential oil from leaves had good biological activities [

 <italic>E. oleosa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-26-01450" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic> [

 <italic>E. largiflorens</italic> [

 <italic>E. citriodora</italic> [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-01450" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] had been proven to possess strong antibacterial activity and widely applied in the field of medicine, food, and the chemical industry. Further research found that 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> essential oil and its components also exhibited the characteristics of herbicides, insecticides, and acaricide [

 <xref rid="B9-molecules-26-01450" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-26-01450" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, so far, few systematic studies were conducted to focus on the bioactivity of 
 <italic>E. grandis Ã— E. urophylla</italic> essential oil (EEO).
