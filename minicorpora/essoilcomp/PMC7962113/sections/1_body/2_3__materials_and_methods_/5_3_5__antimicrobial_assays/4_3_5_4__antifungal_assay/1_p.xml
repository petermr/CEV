<p>The antifungal activity of EEO was evaluated by the growth rate method [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-26-01450" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. EEO resolved by 1% Tween 80 was added to PDA medium to prepare an essential oil PDA culture plate with final concentration at 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg/mL. The PDA culture plate prepared by 1% Tween 80 solution was used as a blank control. The strains were punched into 6-mm hyphal pieces. The inoculation shovel transferred the prepared piece on the medium as the mycelial side was down. Then, the medium was incubated at 25 °C. The mycelial growth was observed every day and the diameter of each culture plate was measured with a Vernier caliper (the average value was measured by centimeter by the cross method for three times) until the culture plate of the blank control was full of mycelium. The inhibitory effect of essential oil was evaluated by the inhibition rate of the day before the blank control board was full (Equation (3)):
 <disp-formula>Antifungal activity (%) = (A0 − A1)/(A0 − 6)
  <label>(3)</label>
 </disp-formula> where the A0 was the diameter of the blank control and A1 was the diameter of the test group.
