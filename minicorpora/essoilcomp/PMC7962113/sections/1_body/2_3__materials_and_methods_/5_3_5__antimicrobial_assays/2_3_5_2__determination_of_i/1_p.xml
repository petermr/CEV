<p>The antibacterial activity of EEO was evaluated by the paper-disc agar diffusion method [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-26-01450" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A round filter paper with a diameter of 6 mm was made with a hole punch and sterilized. In total, 400 μL of bacterial solution (10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU) evenly spread on the luria bertani medium (LB) plate. Four filter papers were placed on the plate after the solution was dried. A total of 5 μL of EEO of different concentrations was dripped on the paper and 1 mg/mL ampicillin sodium was used as a positive control. The plate was then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The diameter of the inhibition zone was measured and expressed in millimeters. The evaluation of the bacteriostatic effect was usually based on the width of the inhibition zone diameter (izd), which is not sensitive for a diameter of ≤8 mm, sensitive at a diameter of 8–14 mm, very sensitive at a diameter of 14–20 mm, and extremely sensitive for a diameter of ≥20 mm [
