<p>Determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bacterium concentration (MBC) was conducted according to the previous method [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-26-01450" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Briefly, EEO was diluted to 10 mg/mL with LB liquid medium and filtered by 0.22 μm of the filter membrane. EEO was added to 96-well plate and then diluted from the first well to another by the dilution method. Subsequently, 100 μL of bacterial solution (concentration 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU) was added into each well (containing 100 μL of EEO). Ampicillin sodium was added as the positive control and the blank control was in the absence of EEO. Then, the plate was placed at 37 °C for 20 h before reading the absorbance at 600 nm. The MIC was identified as the absorbance of the test group was significantly lower than that of the blank control. In total, 100 μL of solution was absorbed from the wells where there was no clear bacterial growth and smeared on LB medium. The colony number was calculated after the plates were cultured at 37 °C for 24 h. MBC was determined as the lowest essential oil concentration with the colony number less than 1.
