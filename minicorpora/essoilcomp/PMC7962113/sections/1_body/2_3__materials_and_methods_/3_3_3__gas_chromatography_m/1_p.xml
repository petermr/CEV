<p>The EEO was diluted to 10 μL/mL by n-hexane and n-hexane was used as blank control. Gas chromatographic conditions: Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometer (Agilent, 7890B-5977A, Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA), HP-5MS column (30 cm × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm), using the temperature program, hold at 40 °C for 5 min, and then rise to 100 °C at the speed of 10 °C/min, keeping at 5 min. Raise the temperature to 160 °C at the speed of 10 °C/min. Then keep for 5 min. Subsequently, the temperature was raised from 10 °C/min to 280 °C to keep at 5 min. Helium was used as the carrier gas and the injection volume was 1 μL with no shunt. The injection port temperature was 260 °C, and the interface temperature was 220 °C. Mass spectrometry conditions: electron bombardment (EI) ion source, electron energy was 70 eV, and electron multiplier voltage was 1.5 kV [

The EEO qualitative identification was based on a comparison of mass spectrometry with standards recorded by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) libraries. In addition, the retention index (RI) was given by the literature. While quantitative analysis of the individual component was carried out by a peak area normalization measurement, the relative content of each component was calculated by the percentage of each peak area [
