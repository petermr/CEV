<p>According to the previous bioassay protocol, Reference [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-26-01450" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] was adopted with slight modifications. The seeds of 
 <italic>Raphanus sativus</italic>, 
 <italic>Lactuca sativa</italic>, 
 <italic>Lolium perenne</italic>, and 
 <italic>Bidens pilosa</italic> were purchased from the seed shop. Sterilized filter papers were put in a sterilized 9-cm diameter petri dishes with 4 mL of different concentrations of EEO and 1% Tween 80 solution as the blank control. Then, 30 seeds of radish, lettuce, ryegrass, and bidens were placed on the filter paper (Chengdu Kelong Chemical Factory, Chengdu, China) in order. Then, the flasks were placed at 22 ± 1 °C for incubation. With the germ root or hypocotyl breaking through the seed coat of 1–2 mm as the seed germination standard, the number of germination of the recipient plant seeds was observed and recorded daily. The statistics were calculated continuously for 7 days to calculate the final germination rate (Equation (4)), germination force (an index used to evaluate the germination speed and uniformity of seeds) (Equation (5)), and germination index (Equation (6)). On the seventh day, the seedling height and main root length of the seedlings (the length from the end to the end of the root) were measured using a vernier caliper. 
 <disp-formula>Germination rate = (A1/A0) × 100%
  <label>(4)</label>
 </disp-formula> where the A1 was the total number of germinated seeds and A0 was the total number of tested seeds. 
 <disp-formula>Germination force = B1/A0
  <label>(5)</label>
 </disp-formula> where the B1 was a number of seeds germinated at the peak of germination and A0 was the total number of tested seeds. 
 <disp-formula>Germination index = ∑(Gt/Dt)
  <label>(6)</label>
 </disp-formula> where the Gt was the number of germinations on the t day and Dt was the number of corresponding germination days.
