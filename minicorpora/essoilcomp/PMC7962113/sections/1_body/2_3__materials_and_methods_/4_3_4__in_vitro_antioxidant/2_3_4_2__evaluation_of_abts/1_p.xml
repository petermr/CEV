<p>The ABTS radical scavenging ability of EEO was determined according to the method of the ABTS assay kit. Furthermore, 190 μL of ABTS working fluid was mixed with 10 μL of different concentrations of EEO (2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg/mL) and then incubated at room temperature (24–26 °C) for 6 min. Ethanol was used as the blank control and ascorbic acid (Vc) solution was the positive control. The absorbance of each mixture was measured at 734 nm. The scavenging ability of ABTS-free radicals was calculated according to the following formula (Equation (2)):
 <disp-formula>ABTS radical scavenging rate (%) = 1 − A1/A0 × 100%
  <label>(2)</label>
 </disp-formula> where the A1 was the absorbance of the sample and ABTS solution and A0 was the absorbance of a blank control.
