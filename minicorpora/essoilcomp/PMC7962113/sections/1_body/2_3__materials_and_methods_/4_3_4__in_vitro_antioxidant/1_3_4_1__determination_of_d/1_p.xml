<p>DPPH-free radical scavenging assay was conducted according to the previous method reported by Luís et al. [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-26-01450" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] with some small modifications. EEO samples were diluted to different concentrations (2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg/mL) by ethanol. In addition, 30 μL of the sample solution and 170 μL of the DPPH ethanol solution (0.4 mM) were added to the 96-well plate for 15 min in the dark at room temperature (24–26 °C). Then the absorbance was determined at 517 nm. In this study, absolute ethanol and ascorbic acid (Vc) were used as a blank control and a positive control, respectively. The scavenging rate of a DPPH-free radical was calculated according to the following formula (Equation (1)):
 <disp-formula>DPPH radical scavenging rate (%) = 1 − A1/A0 × 100%
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where the A1 was the absorbance of the sample and DPPH solution and A0 was the absorbance of a blank control.
