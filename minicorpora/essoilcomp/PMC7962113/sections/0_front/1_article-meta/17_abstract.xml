  <italic>Eucalyptus grandis × E. urophylla</italic> was a unique hybridization in China. However, the chemical and pharmacological properties were rarely reported. Therefore, in this work, we used a steam distillation method to obtain essential oils from leaves of 
  <italic>E. grandis × E. urophylla</italic>, and further evaluated the antioxidant, antimicrobial, and phytotoxic potential of the essential oil. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was applied to investigate the chemical composition of 
  <italic>E. grandis × E. urophylla</italic> essential oil (EEO) and the results showed that the main components of EEO were monoterpenes followed by sesquiterpenes. Among them, α-pinene accounted about 17.02%. EEO could also well scavenge 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2, 2’-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) free radicals showing a good free radical clearance ability. In addition, EEO efficiently inhibited the growth of six kinds of bacteria as well as seven kinds of plant pathogens, especially 
  <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> and 
  <italic>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</italic>. Moreover, the seedling germination of 
  <italic>Raphanus sativus</italic>, 
  <italic>Lactuca sativa</italic>, 
  <italic>Lolium perenne</italic>, and 
  <italic>Bidens pilosa</italic> was significantly suppressed by EEO, thus, indicating essential oils from 
  <italic>eucalyptus</italic> possessed an excellent phytotoxic activity. This study may give a better understanding on EEO and provide a pharmacological activities analysis contributing to the further research of EEO as a functional drug in agronomic and cosmetic industries.
