<p>The PFA (phenolic acids, phenolic di-terpenes, flavonoids, and volatile oils) are considered natural antioxidants, because they are able to donate hydrogens and therefore to interrupt the oxidative chain in tissues. Generally, PFA can trap free radicals and chelate metals. The free radical scavenging activity of PFA depends on the location and number of hydroxyl groups and their capacity to donor hydrogens to metals, which inhibit their pro-oxidant activity [
