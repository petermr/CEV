<p>Currently, consumers are interested in safe and natural foods of animal origin, and in some cases, they are also willing to pay a premium price for them [

 <xref rid="B2-antioxidants-10-00780" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Moreover, the European Union has banned in-feed antibiotics in animal nutrition to prevent antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which has increased the interest in the use of plant feed additives (PFA) as dietary ingredients in animal nutrition [

 <xref rid="B5-antioxidants-10-00780" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Moreover, the possibility of using PFA, such as essential oils, plant extracts, and in particular, plant food industry by-products, is of great interest since it is in harmony with the philosophy underlying environmental sustainability by reducing industry wastes [
