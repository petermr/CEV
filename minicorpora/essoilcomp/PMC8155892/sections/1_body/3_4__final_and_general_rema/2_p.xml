<p>The literature demonstrated that oregano and rosemary extracts can improve carcass weight and yield more strongly than VitE. In pigs, oregano essential oil was able to reduce drip loss, oxidation products, 
 <italic>Longissimus dorsi</italic> proteins, and ash content in comparison to VitE. The use of rosemary extract, in comparison with VitE, increased total fatty acids content and TBARS values in pigs’ meat. Green tea catechins, compared with VitE, did not affect pigs’ slaughter traits and meat preservation characteristics; the latter also not being affected by flavonoid extract and phenolic compounds. Olive leaves were able to reduce the n-6:n-3 and PUFA:SFA ratio and increased the α-tocopherol levels to a lower extent than the supplementation with VitE in the 
 <italic>Longissimus dorsi</italic>, reducing at the same time lipid peroxidation with positive effects on sensory analysis when compared with basal diet. Hot carcass weight and dressing out were increased in swine by the addition of oregano essential oil and quercetin in a higher proportion than VitE, while the same PFA increased carcass pH with positive effects on lipid oxidation that overcame those of VitE. The administration of plant extract rich in polyphenols decreased the proportion of SFA in bovine milk by increasing, at the same time, those of MUFA, with no specific effects on the oxidative stability but with a similar impact than VitE. Hesperidin and naringin reduced milk MDA content after 14 days of preservation. In ovine meat, red wine extract, compared with VitE, increased volatile compound content in n-3 enriched lamb Longissimus dorsi muscle. Grape pomace showed inconsistent effects on meat color, reducing cooking loss at the same time, decreasing MUFA, and increasing PUFA content. Rosemary extract (diterpenes) is as effective as VitE in reducing the total viable count of 
 <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> and Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in a short period under different preservation conditions with some positive effects also on color and odor. Moreover, grape pomace in ovine meat depresses the proportions of SFA (with the exception of the C16:0), and MUFA, with some increasing effects on C18:1 and C18:2, generally overcoming the action of VitE on these fatty acids. It also increased the n-6:n-3 ratio in meat lipids. Grape pomace and grape seed extract were not effective in inhibiting bacterial development on ovine meat, while a more sensible effect was exerted by rosemary diterpenes (carnosic acid and carnosol), especially on total viable count and LAB. The latter PFA were also able to positively affect meat color and odor, reducing meat oxidation and rancid odor. In goats, 
 <italic>Andrographis paniculata</italic> and turmeric acid reduced meat MDA content and were very effective in improving color, also in comparison with VitE, with positive effects on carcass traits.
