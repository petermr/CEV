<p>From the available literature on the topic, the majority of the tested PFA can exert some effect mainly in terms of product quality. The main traits affected by the treatments were (i) the antioxidant status of meat which is generally slightly impaired, (ii) the proportion MUFA and PUFA are often increased, with a reduction in meat drip loss, and improved color and odor, and (iii) the n-6:n-3 ratio varied with the product tested and the animal species. Some positive effects were also demonstrated on product microbiologic parameters, particularly in meat. The effects were, in general, not strictly related to the dose and the nature of the product tested and were consistent between the different animals’ species. The activity of PFA can be similar to those of the synthetic antioxidant VitE, even if the mode of action is actually different. The literature comparing natural with synthetic antioxidants for their effects on the animals and products’ oxidative status is still limited, and the experimental protocols and design are very variable, making it difficult to draw specific conclusions on particular natural product categories.</p>
