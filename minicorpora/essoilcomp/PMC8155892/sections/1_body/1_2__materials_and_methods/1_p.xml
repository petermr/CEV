 <uri xlink:href="www.sciencedirect.com" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.sciencedirect.com</uri>; last accessed on 10 January 2021) databases from January 2000 to December 2020 was performed. Very few papers were published before 2000. In an initial search (conducted in 2018) only 15 papers were found that were in line with our inclusion criteria. Those papers were published between 1976 and 1999. After 2000, papers published on the topic started to increase considerably and the interest in the topic dramatically rose in the last 10â€“13 years. Therefore, we decided to start the review including papers since 2000.
