<p>The dietary PFA supplementation in pigs, rabbits, and ruminants’ diets can exert positive effects on the quality of the derived food products, with variations in their fatty acid content and oxidative status that generally ameliorate the related traits (e.g., odor, color, etc.). Some positive impacts are also exerted on animals’ product yields. The effects of PFA are variable but often similar to those of the synthetic antioxidant VitE, indicating their potential at least as a partial substitute of this vitamin in the diet.</p>
