<p>The VitE (7.238 IU) supplementation in the extruded fed cows had no effect on milk yield, milk fat, or protein percentage, but resulted in a moderate effect on milk fatty acids profile [

On the other hand, a slight increase in the percentages of C6:0, C18:0, C20:0, and MUFA, and a decrease in C16:0, C22:5n-3, and SFA in the milk fat of extruded fed cows were found when supplemented with plants extracts (191 g) rich in polyphenols, compared with VitE [
 <xref rid="B43-antioxidants-10-00780" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Thus, the simultaneous supplementation of extruded linseed-fed cows with plant extracts and VitE tented to reduce the impact of VitE alone on the milk’s fatty acids profile, although it had no effect on dairy performance [
