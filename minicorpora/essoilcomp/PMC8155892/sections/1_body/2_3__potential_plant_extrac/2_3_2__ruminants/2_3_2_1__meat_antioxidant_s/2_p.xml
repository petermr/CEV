<p>Neither the addition of grape pomace (GP; 51.7 or 103 g/kg DM) nor extra VitE (450 mg/kg DM) in the ewes’ basal diet (50 mg VitE/kg DM) affected the animal performance, carcass characteristics, and meat quality of their suckling lambs [

However, the proportions of MUFA in the intramuscular fat of suckling lambs were declined significantly, when the goats’ diet, which contained 50 mg VitE/kg DM in the vitamin premix, was supplemented with either GP (51.7 or 103 g/kg DM) or extra VitE (450 mg/kg DM) [
