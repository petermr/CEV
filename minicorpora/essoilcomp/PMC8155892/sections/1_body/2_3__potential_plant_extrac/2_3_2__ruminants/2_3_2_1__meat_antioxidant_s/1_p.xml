<p>Luciano and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B32-antioxidants-10-00780" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] partially replaced the barley grain of lambs’ diets with dried citrus pulp as a source of natural VitE, in order to test its effect on their antioxidant capacity. Although these researchers did not use any extra quantity of synthetic VitE (α-tocopherol acetate or α-tocopherol) in the experimental diets, an increase in the concentrations of VitE in liver, plasma, and muscles of lambs fed with the dried citrus pulp was observed. This was not accompanied by any change in lipid oxidation of the above raw tissues. Nevertheless, lambs’ muscles challenged with further stressors, such as the presence of Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>/Asc, which induce lipid peroxidation, revealed lower TBARS values, which were negatively correlated with the concentrations of VitE in the above tissues. A significantly higher daily intake of VitE (6.23 vs. 12.22 mg) in weaned lambs fed concentrate was found, when they were fed dried tomato pomace on an ad libitum basis [
 <xref rid="B7-antioxidants-10-00780" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although the dried tomato pomace did not affect the lambs’ performance, it significantly reduced their concentrate intake. Additionally, the dietary inclusion of dried tomato pomace increased the concentrations of linoleic acid, VitE, and vitamin A in lambs’ meat. Although VitE intake was higher in the dried tomato pomace-fed lambs, no increase in the concentration of this vitamin in their muscles was found. This might be the reason for the unaffected lipid oxidation (as determined by TBARS assay) observed in lambs’ raw meat.
