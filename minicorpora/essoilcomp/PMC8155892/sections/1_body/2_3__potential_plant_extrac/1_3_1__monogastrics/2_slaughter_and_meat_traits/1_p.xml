<p>Only few studies exist on PFA effects on slaughter and meat traits in monogastrics. The dietary inclusion of vitamin E (VitE, 200 mg/kg) and oregano essential oil (OEO; 0.025% of the diet) for 28 days before slaughter decreased the pH measured 45 min post-mortem (by 3.6% and 4.0%, respectively) of the 
 <italic>Longissimus thoracis</italic> et 
 <italic>lumborum</italic> muscle in pigs exposed to a 5 h transport stress without reaching the pH (6.63) of the unsupplemented and unstressed animals. These differences in the meat pH were not observed at 24 h post-mortem [

However, the OEO, and not the VitE, was able to counteract the increase in drip loss related to the transportation. Other meat quality parameters, such as meat color, electrical conductivity, and intramuscular fat, were not affected by transport stress or dietary supplementation [
