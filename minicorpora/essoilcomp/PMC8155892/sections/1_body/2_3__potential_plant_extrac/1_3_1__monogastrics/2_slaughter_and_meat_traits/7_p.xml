<p>The chemical composition (moisture, protein, lipids, ash, and cholesterol) of rabbit’s LD muscle did not differ when the standard diet (50 mg/kg of VitE) was supplemented with VitE (150 mg/kg), oregano extract (OE, 0.2% of the diet), RE (0.2% of the diet), or oregano and rosemary extract simultaneously (0.1% OE + 0.1% RE of the diet, ORE) [
 <xref rid="B30-antioxidants-10-00780" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Lower moisture (by 2.0%) and higher protein (by 5.8%) levels were observed in meat from animals consuming VitE compared with OE enriched diets, whereas ORE had only a higher moisture content than VitE fed animals (by 2.0%). Ash content was lower after OE and ORE compared with VitE supplementation (by 8.1%), whereas the rosemary addition lead to intermediate values. However, dietary supplementation with VitE, OE, and RE does not affect the chemical and mineral composition of rabbits’ hind leg meat. Only TBARs values of rabbits’ LD muscle were reduced by dietary supplements. The oxidative stability of raw meat was better preserved (lower TBARS) when VitE or OE, compared with rosemary extract alone or combined with oregano, were added in rabbits’ rations. Dietary supplementation also affected rabbits’ bone traits of the hind leg. Bones of the OE compared with VitE fed animals were heavier, probably because of a heavier femur weight [
