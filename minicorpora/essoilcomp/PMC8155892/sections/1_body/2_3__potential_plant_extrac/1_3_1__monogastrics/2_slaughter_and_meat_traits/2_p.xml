<p>The dietary addition of OEO and Quercetin (QU) during a 28 days trial in finishing pigs also affected some meat traits after 5 h of transportation [

The pH (45 min post-mortem) increased in OEO (by 5.6%) and QU (by 4.9%) groups only compared to the control group, whereas pH (24 h post-mortem) was greater only in QU (by 3.2%) fed pigs. The dietary inclusion of OEO and QU improved meat color (measured by Opto-star color tester) at 24 h post-mortem, in both PFA groups (by 16.9% and 10.8%, respectively), compared with the negative control. Drip loss (at 24 h post-mortem) was also reduced in OEO (by 35.3%) and QU (by 35.9%) compared with the control group. Furthermore, OEO and QU were as effective as VitE in ameliorating the antioxidant status in the pigsâ€™ muscles. The dietary supplementation with OEO and QU, compared with the basal diet, reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS; by 18.0% and 21.0%, respectively) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS; by 19.4% and 20.4%, respectively;
