<p>No significant differences in lipid oxidation (malondialdehyde, MDA) of cooked and raw pig meat were observed when different antioxidant additives (40 mg/kg of rosemary extract (RE), 40 mg/kg of RE plus 2 mg/kg of gallic acid (REG), 40 mg/kg of RE plus 40 mg/kg of VitE (REE), compared with VitE alone (40 mg/kg), were included in a linseed oil-rich diet [
 <xref rid="B23-antioxidants-10-00780" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Only in raw meat, TBARS values were higher in REG (by 67.6%) than in the negative control group, and in RE (by 129.3%) and REG (by 190.2%) than in the VitE group. No significant effects were reported on some slaughter traits and on the fatty acid composition of the
