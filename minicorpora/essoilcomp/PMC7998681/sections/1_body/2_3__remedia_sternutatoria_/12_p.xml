<p>Cardamom (

 <xref rid="B80-molecules-26-01627" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. This bicyclic monoterpenoid has been shown to activate TRPA1, but not TRPV1 channels [
 <xref rid="B81-molecules-26-01627" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. In contrast, Takaishi and his colleagues reported that 1,8-cineole is a natural antagonist of human TRPA1 channels [
 <xref rid="B82-molecules-26-01627" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. This bimodal action has been reported with menthol, in which the activity at the mouse TRPA1 was concentration dependent; it was an agonist at low concentrations and an antagonist at higher concentrations [
