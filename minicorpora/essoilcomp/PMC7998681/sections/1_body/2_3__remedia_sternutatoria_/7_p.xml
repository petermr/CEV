 <italic>Nicotianae</italic> species are recognized as tobacco plants. Snuff is made from finely ground tobacco leaves. When applied locally, nicotine often causes a sneeze [

 <xref rid="B56-molecules-26-01627" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], similar to the effect at nicotinic cholinergic receptors [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-26-01627" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Notably, Talavera showed that the TRPA1 channel regulates the nicotine-induced nasal irritating effect rather than nicotinic cholinergic receptors [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-26-01627" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Furthermore, the TRPV1 response to capsaicin was found to be sensitized by nicotine [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-26-01627" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]; however, a later study found that nicotine-inhibited TRPV1 [
