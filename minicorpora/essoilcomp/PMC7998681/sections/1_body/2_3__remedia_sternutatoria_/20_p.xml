 <italic>Asarum</italic> (genus) is commonly known as wild ginger due to its rhizomes and ginger root similarity in taste and smell. Most of the plants belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> contain aristolochic acid [
 <xref rid="B108-molecules-26-01627" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Aristolochic acid might activate TRPA1 channels as TRPA1 antagonists suppress the thermally dependent taste effect of aristolochic acid [

 <italic>Asarum</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B108-molecules-26-01627" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. It activated human TRPA1, exhibiting higher EC50 (~160 μM) than allyl isothiocyanate (EC50 ~ 7 μM) [
