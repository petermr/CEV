<p>Galangal, reported over history, is most probably in reference to either greater galangal (
 <italic>Alpinia galanga</italic>) or lesser galangal (
 <italic>Alpinia officinarum</italic>) or black galangal (
 <italic>Kaempferia galangal</italic>). The key pungent compound of 
 <italic>Alpinia galanga</italic>, 1′-acetoxychavicol acetate, was found to activate TRPA1 in HEK cells; it expressed those receptors, but did not activate TRPV1. Notably, 1′-acetoxychavicol acetate showed higher potency (3.8-fold lower EC50) than the usual TRPA1 agonist (allyl isothiocyanate) [

 <italic>Alpinia officinarum</italic>; galangal appears to be the principal component in various parts of the plant, such as the leaves, rhizomes and aerial parts [
