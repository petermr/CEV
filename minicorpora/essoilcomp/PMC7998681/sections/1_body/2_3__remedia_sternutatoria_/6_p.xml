 <italic>Achillea ptarmica</italic>: the name ptarrmica comes from the Greek word ptairo (sneeze), while achillea is related to the heroâ€™s heel and the belief that the plant can heal wounds. The colloquial Italian name of the plant is sternutella, while in English it is called sneezewort. It is assumed that alkyl-amides are responsible for most pharmacological actions of the

Trans-Pellitorine, an aliphatic alkylamide analogue of capsaicin, is reported to activate TRPV1 and TRPA1 channels; however, recent studies have found that this is mediated indirectly, possibly via the downstream signaling of an unknown molecular target [
