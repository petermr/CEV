 <italic>Capsicum</italic>) and cayenne pepper, is the typical agonist of TRPV1 [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-26-01627" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Dong et al. revealed that threonine 671 (T671) found on the pore-forming S6 segment is a vital site for the piperine-induced activation of TRPV1. It is assumed that piperine directly interacts with the S6 segment to facilitate the opening of the channel [

 <italic>N</italic>-diisobutyl, eliminated TRPV1 interactions [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-26-01627" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Other studies found that piperine and its analogs activate not only TRPV1, but also TRPA1 [

 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-01627" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of piperine for TRPV1 and TRPA1 was found to be 250 and 58 times higher than capsaicin and allyl isothiocyanate (a typical agonist of TRPA1), respectively [
