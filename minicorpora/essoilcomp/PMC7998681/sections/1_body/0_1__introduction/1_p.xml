<p>When we sneeze (sternutatio), one of the upper airway reflexes, starting with a deep inspiration proceeded by involuntary expulsion of air [

 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-01627" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels have been reported to play a role in sneezing as nasal receptors [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-26-01627" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The TRP channel superfamily consists of 28-cation channels divided into six subfamilies. The TRPA1 (ankyrin subfamily, member 1) is known as the wasabi receptor (typical ligand is allyl isothiocyanate, the main pungent compound of wasabi) and the TRPV1 (vanilloid subfamily, member 1) is known as the hot chili pepper receptor (typical ligand is capsaicin, the pungent compound of hot chili pepper) [
