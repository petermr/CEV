<p>Subsequent to the excitation of receptors in the nasal mucous membranes, sensory information is transmitted mainly via the nasopalatine nerve (branch of the maxillary nerve; NC V2), while accompanying parasympathetic afferent fibers run to the pterygopalatine ganglion, and then to the superior salivatory nucleus. A putative sneezing center in the medulla is activated and a complex motor pattern is initiated: a deep inspiration is triggered, accompanied by the head tilting to the back, eye closure and nasopharyngeal and glottis closure. The airway closure allows for the intrathoracic pressure to build up following contraction of the expiratory muscles, which is followed by head tilting to the front, glottis opening and an explosive expulsion of air from the lungs (hopefully of the noxious stimulus) [
