<p>Yang et al., 2015. showed that the aliphatic chain of capsaicin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01627-f010">Figure 10</xref>, a typical agonist of TRPV1) forms nonspecific Van der Waals interactions with the channel, contributing to binding affinity. On the other hand, the amide and vanillyl groups’ interactions with T551 and E571, respectively, via hydrogen bonding, are essential for the specificity of ligand binding [

Resinferatoxin comprises a very similar pharmacophore to capsaicin, including vanillyl ester (similar to the amide group) and aliphatic groups, explaining its activity against only TRPV1. However, eugenol, 6-paradol, 6-gingerol and 6-shogaol maintained the vanillyl group, but not the amide, which might explain the additional activity against TRPA1. In the majority of these compounds, the amide group was replaced with polar entities and it was reported that this type of replacement reserves functionality, justifying their TRPV1 activity [

Essentially, Del Prete et al. revealed an orthogonal structure–activity relationship for TRPV1 and TRPA1 binding, and proposed that agonists acting on both TRPA1 (non-electrophilic) and TRPV1 can be obtained by modifying the capsaicin pharmacophore [
