<p>TRPA1 and TRPV1 channels have six transmembrane (S1â€“S6) polypeptide subunits, permeable to cations via a pore formed by a tetramer assembly [
 <xref rid="B142-molecules-26-01627" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. The hydrophobic pore region is located between S5 and S6 [
 <xref rid="B143-molecules-26-01627" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. TRPA1 and TRPV1 contain ankyrin repeat motifs at the intracellular 
 <italic>N</italic>-terminal; however, TRPA1 possess a remarkably high number of ankyrins [
