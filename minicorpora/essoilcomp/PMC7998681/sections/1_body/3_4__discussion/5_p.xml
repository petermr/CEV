<p>TRPA1 has a very distinct mechanism of activation. Agonists activate TRPA1 via covalent modifications of the cysteine and lysine residues located in the ankyrin repeat motifs within the cytoplasmic 
 <italic>N</italic>-terminus of the channel. Thus, TRPA1 activators can be categorized into thiol-reactive electrophilic compounds, which activate TRPA1 via covalent modification, and non-electrophilic compounds that activate TRPA1 via ligand binding [

 <xref rid="B145-molecules-26-01627" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. Allyl isothiocyanate, an electrophile, was shown to form adduct with thiols and primary amines, proposing covalent modification. Notably, it was reported that thiol-reactive compounds of various structures activated TRPA1 via this mechanism [

Cuminal, acetophenone, acetoxychavicol, aristocholic acid, piperine, 6-paradol, 6-gingerol, 6-shogaol, pellitorine and camphor all potentially activate TRPA1 via covalent modification of the cysteine/lysine residues because of their electrophilic characteristics. This supports the finding that most of the noxious stimuli and electrophilic compounds activate TRPA1 via this distinctive mechanism, which explains its polymodal activity [

 <xref rid="B78-molecules-26-01627" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. The plausible mechanism of TRPA1 activation by linalool, 1,8-cineole, eugenol and methyl eugenol is via a similar non-covalent mechanism, as they are weak or non-electrophilic molecules.
