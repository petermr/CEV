<p>Several binding sites have been reported for TRPV1 agonists. This might explain the reported TRPV1-inducing activity of camphor and allyl isothiocyanate, which lack the capsaicin pharmacophore. After interaction with residues in the S4â€“S5 linkers, capsaicin and resiniferatoxin twitch them away, thus opening the channel. It was found that the pore region is extremely flexible, and thus, every agonist might result in a different gating mechanism [
