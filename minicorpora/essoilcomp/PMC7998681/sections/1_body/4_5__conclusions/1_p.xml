<p>Historically, physicians commonly used various mixtures to induce sneezing; however, they were unaware and lacking knowledge of the molecular mechanism that explains this reflex. Today, after examining the constituents of these sneeze-inducing remedies, the majority are found to be agonists of TRPA1 and TRPV1 channels. This is in parallel with the role of TRPA1 and TRPV1 channels in sneezing. The paper sheds light on the potential area of research on TRP antagonism to treat sneezing. Additional investigations are required to explore the structureâ€“activity relationship of these active ingredients.</p>
