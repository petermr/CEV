 <p>Sneezing (sternutatio) is a poorly understood polysynaptic physiologic reflex phenomenon. Sneezing has exerted a strange fascination on humans throughout history, and induced sneezing was widely used by physicians for therapeutic purposes, on the assumption that sneezing eliminates noxious factors from the body, mainly from the head. The present contribution examines the various mixtures used for inducing sneezes (remedia sternutatoria) over the centuries. The majority of the constituents of the sneeze-inducing remedies are modulators of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. The TRP channel superfamily consists of large heterogeneous groups of channels that play numerous physiological roles such as thermosensation, chemosensation, osmosensation and mechanosensation. Sneezing is associated with the activation of the wasabi receptor, (TRPA1), typical ligand is allyl isothiocyanate and the hot chili pepper receptor, (TRPV1), typical agonist is capsaicin, in the vagal sensory nerve terminals, activated by noxious stimulants.</p>
