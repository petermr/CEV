  <title>Context</title>
  <p>COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that causes a severe infection in the respiratory system. 
   <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> L. (Ranunculaceae) is an annual flowering plant used traditionally as a natural food supplement and multipurpose medicinal agent.

 <sec>
  <title>Objective</title>
  <p>The possible beneficial effects of 
   <italic>N. sativa</italic>, and its constituent, thymoquinone (TQ) on COVID-19 were reviewed.
  </p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Methods</title>
  <p>The key words including, COVID-19, 
   <italic>N. sativa</italic>, thymoquinone, antiviral effects, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects in different databases such as Web of Science (ISI), PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched from 1990 up to February 2021.
  </p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Results</title>
  <p>The current literature review showed that 
   <italic>N. sativa</italic> and TQ reduced the level of pro-inflammatory mediators including, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-12, while enhancing IFN-Î³. 
   <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> and TQ increased the serum levels of IgG1 and IgG2a, and improved pulmonary function tests in restrictive respiratory disorders.
  </p>

 <sec>
  <title>Discussion and conclusions</title>
  <p>These preliminary data of molecular docking, animal, and clinical studies propose 
   <italic>N. sativa</italic> and TQ might have beneficial effects on the treatment or control of COVID-19 due to antiviral, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties as well as bronchodilatory effects. The efficacy of 
   <italic>N. sativa</italic> and TQ on infected patients with COVID-19 in randomize clinical trials will be suggested.
