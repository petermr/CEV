<p>This review article descriptively highlights the possible effects of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> and its major constituent with their underlying mechanism(s) of action on COVID-19. According to our literature survey, 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> and TQ have various important properties including, antiviral properties, stimulation of humoral and cellular immune responses, modulation of immune responses, improvement of eosinophil counts and IgE serum levels, reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-4, IL-1β, IL-6, TGF-β, and IL-17), and enhancement of anti-inflammatory cytokines, IFN-γ and FOXP3. In addition, 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> and TQ showed relaxant effects on tracheal smooth muscle (
 <italic>in vitro</italic>) and also improved PFT values in obstructive lung diseases such as asthma. Since, ARDS along with cytokine storm of pro-inflammatory cytokines is the main cause of death among COVID-19 patients and with reference to the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> and TQ, as well as the protective effects on obstructive lung diseases, this herb may be useful for the treatment of COVID-19. However, clinical studies are required to support drug effectiveness.
