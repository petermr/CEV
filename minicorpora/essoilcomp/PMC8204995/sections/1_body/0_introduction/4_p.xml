<p>Natural products and essential oils are well recognized for their antiviral, anti-inflammatory and immuno-modulatory activities (Asif et al.

 <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). It has been reported that various monoterpenoid phenols obtained from plants including carvacrol have the potential to inhibit the binding of viral spike (S) glycoprotein to the host cell (Kulkarni et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Also carvacrol can inhibit ACE2 activity and suggested that it may block the host cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 (Abdelli et al.
