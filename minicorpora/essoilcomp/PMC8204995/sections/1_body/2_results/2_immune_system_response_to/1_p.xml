<p>As antigens, viruses stimulate humoral and cellular immune responses. The induction of the immune system response to a virus is mediated by virus-specific T and B cells (Cox and Brokstad 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The pattern of antibody production, especially the production of immunoglobulins M and G (IgM and IgG), against SARS-CoV-2 is similar to common acute viral infections (Li et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). The number of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells as humoral responses significantly reduced in the peripheral blood of infected patients with SARS-CoV2 (Xu et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0081" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Similarly, reduction of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in the acute phase of infection with SARS-CoV is also associated with reduction in the number of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells (Fan et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Moreover, CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells also showed a similar effect in infected mice with MERS-CoV (Zhao et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0083" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).
