<p>Cytokine storm is one of the main mechanisms for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the systemic inflammatory response resulting from the release of large amounts of pro-inflammatory mediators including IFN-α, IL-1b, IL (6 − 12 − 18 and 33), TNF-α, TGFβ, etc. and chemokines by immune effector cells in SARS-CoV infection (Cameron et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Huang et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Patients with MERS-CoV infection showed elevated levels of pro-inflammatory mediators in the serum similar to infection with SARS-CoV (Min et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The cytokine storm will be started by the immune system to cause ARDS and various organs to failure, which may be lead to death in severe cases infected with SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV (Xu et al.
