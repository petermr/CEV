<p>Immunotherapy is characterized as an approach to disease management by producing or enhancing an immune response to a present disorder (Vanderlugt and Miller 
 <xref rid="CIT0079" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Cytokines such as, interleukins (IL), chemokines, interferons (IFN), and tumour necrosis factors (TNF) are small, non-structural proteins, which have multitude effects in various organs (Dinarello 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). The pro-inflammatory mediators include IL-17, IL-1β, and TNF-α, and anti-inflammatory mediators include, IL-10, and IL-1ra (Su et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0076" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The pathogenic roles of cytokines including; IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, IL-23, IFN-α and IFN-γ in a heterogenic autoimmune inflammatory disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is shown (Su et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0076" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The roles of Th2 cytokines such as IL-4 in the pathogenesis of asthma is also reported (Steinke and Borish
