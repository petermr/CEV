 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> is widely grown in the Mediterranean region, the west of Asia, Middle East, southern Europe, and north Africa (Tembhurne et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0077" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). 
 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> seed has been traditionally used for the treatment of fever, infection, chest congestion, inflammation, cough, bronchitis, asthma, chronic headache, dysmenorrhoea, obesity, diabetes, flatulence, and diarrhoea (Durmuskahya and Ozturk 
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Nasir et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The active ingredient of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seed is mainly thymoquinone (TQ) which showed anti-inflammatory effects by suppression of prostaglandins and leukotrienes as inflammatory mediators (Hajhashemi et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Antioxidant and anti-epileptic, as well as anti-Alzheimer’s and anti-Parkinson’s disease effects of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> and TQ, were previously reported (Khazdair
