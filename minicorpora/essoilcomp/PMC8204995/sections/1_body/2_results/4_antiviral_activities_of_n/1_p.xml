<p>Antiviral effect of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> oil in murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) model was investigated by administration of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> oil (100 μg/100 μL, i.p.) to BALB/c mice. Treatment with 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> oil significantly reduced the load of virus in spleen and liver 3 days after infection compared to the control group. The antiviral effect of the plant oil accorded with increasing serum level of IFN-γ and increasing numbers of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> helper T cells. Moreover, the titre of virus was undetectable in liver and spleen after 10 days while it was detectable in control mice (Salem and Hossain 
 <xref rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). The antiviral effect of plant oil is related to the increasing response of CD4 cells. The effects of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> oil on pathogenesis and immune response of H9N2 avian influenza virus (H9N2 AIV) in infected turkeys showed positive results. Turkeys fed with diets containing 2%, 4% and 6% of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> oil significantly decreased mortality rate along with an increased in the body weight of turkeys. Turkeys fed with 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> (6%) had significantly lower titre of virus compared to the control group. Moreover, 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> increased the mRNA expression of IFN-γ compared to the control group. The enhancement of antibody titre against H9N2 AIV in turkeys fed with 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> showed the immune regulatory effects of the plant. Additionally, treatment of (H9N2 AIV) infected turkeys with TQ and curcumin significantly increased expression of IFN-γ and antibody titre against H9N2 AIV in birds. TQ also reduced virus shedding and enhanced immune responses in treated animals that lead to suppress pathogenesis of H9N2 viruses (Umar et al.
