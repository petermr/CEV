<p>The pharmacological properties of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seed and TQ including immunomodulatory, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory active and their potential therapeutic strategy against COVID‐19 were reviewed (Islam et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). It has been reported that some natural products such as TQ have high to a moderate binding affinity to the heat Shock Protein A5 (HSPA5) substrate-binding domain β (SBDβ), which reported to be the recognition site for the SARS-CoV-2 spike. This natural compound may be used to reduce the risk of COVID-19 or possibly to treat the disease, especially in high-risk people (Elfiky
