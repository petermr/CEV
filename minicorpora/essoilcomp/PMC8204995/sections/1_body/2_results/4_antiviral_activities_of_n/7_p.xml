<p>The constituents of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> such as, α-hederin, thymohydroquinone, and TQ have efficiently binding to ACE
 <sub>2</sub> and potential therapeutic effects of these bioactive components to combat COVID-19 in-silico study was suggested (Jakhmola Mani et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The affinity of TQ on SARS–Cov-2 E protein and inhibitory effects on E protein ion channel were showed in the molecular docking study (Mohideen 
 <xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). It has been reported that TQ may inhibit SARS–CoV‐2 and interfere with its binding to ACE2 receptors in molecular docking studies (Bouchentouf and Missoum 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Sekiou et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). This can prevent virus entry and replication inside the host cell. The results of these studies demonstrate the potential of TQ on virus machinery as well as virus entry and the replication in the host cells. Antiviral effects of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> and TQ are shown in
