<p>The gene expression of NF-κB regulated of anti-apoptotic factors such as inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP)-1, IAP2, XIAP Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL, and angiogenic (MMP-9 and VEGF) gene products were also down regulated in human myeloid leukaemia cell line (KBM-5) by TQ (Sethi et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0073" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). The gene expression of IL-1β, TNF-α, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) cells were significantly reduced by TQ (25–75 μM). TQ also showed an incisory effect on TNF-α mediated of NF-κB activation in placenta-derived cells (PDA) but decreased the transport of NF-κB from the cytosol to the nucleus (Chehl et al.
