<p>Administration of TQ (3 mg/kg, i.p.) decreased the production of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and leukotriene C4 (LTC4) in the BALF of mice. Furthermore, the levels of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 were also significantly decreased while IL-10 was increased when TQ administered before OVA challenge (El Gazzar, El Mezayen, Nicolls et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Similarly, TQ (3 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly decreased elevated serum levels of IgE and IgG1 and also inhibited allergen induced lung inflammation and production of mucus by goblet cells. TQ also significantly inhibited IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 but increased IFN-γ production in the BALF. In addition, a small effect of TQ was observed on the production of IL-4 in OVA-stimulated cultured lung cells. These results indicated the effect of TQ on reduction of airway inflammation (inhibition of eosinophil infiltration into the airways) and Th
 <sub>2</sub> cytokines productions (El Gazzar, El Mezayen, Marecki et al.

Orally administration of TQ (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg/day, p.o.) for 14 days after Alzheimer’s disease (AD) induction in rats, decreased amyloid-β (Aβ) formation and accumulation, and also reduced the levels of TNF-α and IL-1β. Furthermore, it significantly down regulated the expression of NF-κB and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) mRNAs (Abulfadl et al.
