<p>Treatment of LPS-activated mast cells with TQ (10 μM) restored LPS-induced changes in IL-5 and IL-13 at mRNA and protein levels but did not affect IL-10 production. In addition, TQ inhibited globin transcription factor (GATA) binding at the IL-5 promoter induced by LPS stimulation (El Gazzar 
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). In addition, TQ treatment (1–20 μM) significantly inhibited the release of IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-α from LPS-induced dendritic cells (DCs) and suppressed phosphorylation of pro-survival factors protein kinase B (AKT) and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), but induced caspase-3 and caspase-8 activity in DCs (Xuan et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0082" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). TQ (0–25 μM) also dose-dependently inhibited TNFα-induced nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation via inhibition of NF-κB kinase (IKK) activity, and subsequently suppressed phosphorylation and activation of NF-κBα (IκBα) (Sethi et al.
