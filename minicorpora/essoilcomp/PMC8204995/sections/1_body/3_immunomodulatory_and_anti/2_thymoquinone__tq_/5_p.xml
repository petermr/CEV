<p>In diabetic rat mothers, TQ supplementation (20 mg/kg, p.o.) during pregnancy and lactation periods restored IL-2 levels and T cells proliferation and saved both circulating and thymus-homing T cells in the rat offspring (Badr et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). These results indicated an inhibitory effect for TQ on eosinophilia, Th
 <sub>2</sub> cytokines, and allergen-specific antibodies which resulted in reduction of allergen-induced inflammation. These results showed immune-modulatory effect of TQ and suggests its therapeutic value in allergic and immune-deficiency induced disorders.
