<p>The prophylactic effect of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> boiled extract was shown in asthmatic patients. Administration hydro-ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seed extract (15 mg/kg/day) for a 3-month period improved respiratory symptoms such as chest wheeze, and pulmonary function test (PFT) values in asthmatic patients compared to the placebo treated group. Furthermore, the need for bronchodilator drugs were decreased in 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> compared to the placebo-treated patients (Boskabady et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). The bronchodilatory effect of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seed hydro-ethanolic extract (50 and 100 mg/kg/day, p.o.) in asthmatic patients in comparison with theophylline (6 mg/kg/day) increased pulmonary function tests (PFTs) values, and specific airway conductance (sGaw) compared to the baseline measurements. However, this effect on the most PFT values was less than that of theophylline (Boskabady et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Similarly, a 2-month adjuvant treatment with 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seed boiled extract (187 mg/kg/day, p.o.) in sulphur mustard poisoned patients showed a decline in the use of bronchodilator drugs compared to the baseline. In addition, the respiratory symptoms and PFT values significantly improved with no adverse effects during the study (Boskabady and Farhadi
