<p>Aqueous 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seed extract (50 µg/mL) suppressed lymphocytes response to all mitogens and allogeneic cells. Also, 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> extract (0.5 µg/mL) stimulated lymphocytes response to allogeneic cells. Moreover, below-10-kDa fraction of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> stimulated the production of IL-1β and IL-3 by human lymphocytes without need for any mitogen or other human allogeneic cells. The most marked increase in IL-3 production was noted when 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> extract (0.5 µg/mL) was added to lymphocytes culture. However, 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> extract did not effect on IL-2 secretion by mitogen-activated lymphocytes (Haq et al.

 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seed (2.8 g/kg, bw) reduced the expression of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF β1) and increased remyelination in the cerebellum (Noor et al.

 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seed (100, 200, 400 mg/kg, i.p.) on LPS (1 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced lung injury in rats, decreased the total and different WBC counts as well as oxidative stress biomarkers in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum. Furthermore, treatment with 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> extract dose-dependently reduced TGF-β1, IFN-γ, PGE2, IL-4 levels in the BALF as well as pathological changes in the lung (Mokhtari-Zaer et al.
