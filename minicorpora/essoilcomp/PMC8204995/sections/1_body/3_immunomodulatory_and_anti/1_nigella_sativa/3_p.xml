 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> oil exhibits airway anti-inflammatory and immune-regulatory effects which may support its use for treatment of allergic asthma. The eosinophil count in peripheral blood, IgG1 and IgG2a levels, cytokines profile including, IL-2, IL-10, IL-12, and IFN-γ levels, and also inflammatory cells in the lung tissue were significantly decreased by the plant oil in a mouse model of allergic asthma. The plant showed comparable immunomodulatory properties with those of dexamethasone except for its effect on IFN-γ level (Abbas et al.
