<p>IL-1β and IL-4 levels were increased following addition of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seed aqueous extract (1 and 2 µg/mL) to culture medium of non-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and allogeneic cells. Whole 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> proteins (0.1, 1 or 10 µg/mL) suppressed the production of IL-8 in non-stimulated as well as pokeweed mitogen-activated PBMC cells. Whole soluble 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seed extract (2 µg/mL) also increased TNF-α production. Furthermore, fractionated extract of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> was less effective than whole
