<p>This herb has been used as a safe herbal food against inflammatory diseases including asthma, allergy, and metabolic syndrome due to its immunomodulatory effects and low cytotoxicity (Gholamnezhad et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Ethanol extract of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seed (1000 µg/mL) reduced the secretion of IL-4 in phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and concanavalin A (Con A)-stimulated splenocytes. In addition, 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seed extracts (500 and 1000 µg/mL) decreased IFN-γ secretion in stimulated and non-stimulated splenocytes (Gholamnezhad et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The effects of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seed aqueous extract (1, 10, 50, and 100 µg/mL) on splenocytes proliferation, the function of macrophages in BALB/c mice, and natural killer (NK) activity of C57/BL6 showed significant and dose-dependently elevation of the splenocytes proliferation (Majdalawieh et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The pattern of cytokine secretion by splenocytes was changed by the plant extract in favour of Th
 <sub>2</sub> pathway. The aqueous extract of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seed (50 and 100 µg/mL) significantly enhanced the secretion of IL-4 and IL-10 but suppressed TNF-α, IL-6, and NO by primary macrophages. In addition, the plant extract increased NK cells cytotoxic activity against YAC-1 tumour cells which suggested an antitumor activity for the plant (Majdalawieh et al.
