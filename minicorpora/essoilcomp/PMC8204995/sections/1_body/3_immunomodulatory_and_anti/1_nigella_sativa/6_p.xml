<p>Administration of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds volatile oil (2.5 µL ≅ 2.10 µg, intramuscular (i.m.), twice a week for 30 days) in rats significantly reduced antibody titre (1280 versus 2560) compared to the control animals. Furthermore, the splenocytes and neutrophils counts were significantly decreased, but peripheral lymphocytes and monocytes were increased in the experimental animals that received 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds volatile oil (Islam et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Serum protein and total immunoglobulin levels of fish fed with diets containing 1, 2.5 and 5% of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> oil for 21 days were significantly increased. Furthermore, haematocrit level was significantly increased in group fed with 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> (5%) compared to the control group (Dorucu et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).
