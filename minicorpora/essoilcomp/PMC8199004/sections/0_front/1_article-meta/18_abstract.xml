 <p>This work aimed to study the chemical composition, cholinesterase inhibitory activity, and enantiomeric analysis of the essential oil from the aerial parts (leaves and flowers) of the plant 
  <italic>Lepechinia paniculata</italic> (Kunth) Epling from Ecuador. The essential oil (EO) was obtained through steam distillation. The chemical composition of the oil was evaluated by gas chromatography, coupled to mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and a flame ionization detector (GC-FID). The analyses led to the identification of 69 compounds in total, of which 40 were found in the leaves and 29 were found in the flowers of the plant. The major components found in the oil were 1,8-Cineole, β-Pinene, δ-3-Carene, α-Pinene, (
  <italic>E</italic>)-Caryophyllene, Guaiol, and β-Phellandrene. Flower essential oil showed interesting selective inhibitory activity against both enzymes AChE (28.2 ± 1.8 2 µg/mL) and BuChE (28.8 ± 1.5 µg/mL). By contrast, the EO of the leaves showed moderate mean inhibitory activity against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), with IC
  <sub>50</sub> values of 38.2 ± 2.9 µg/mL and 47.4 ± 2.3 µg/mL, respectively.
