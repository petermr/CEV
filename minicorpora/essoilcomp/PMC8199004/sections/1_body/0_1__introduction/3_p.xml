<p>Regarding the studies of essential oils (EOs) of other 
 <italic>Lepechinia</italic> species from the southern region of Ecuador, in 2002, Malagón et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-03198" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] identified 54 compounds in 
 <italic>Lepechinia mutica</italic> (Benth) EO collected in “Cerro el Villonaco” (Loja, Ecuador); monoterpene hydrocarbons were the main group of constituents (72%), among which β-Phellandrene (30%), Camphene (13%), Limonene (8%), ∆3-Carene (6%), and α-Pinene (3%) were the most abundant. In another study, Ramírez et al. [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-26-03198" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] described the chemical composition, enantiomeric analysis, sensorial evaluation, and antifungal activity of 
 <italic>Lepechinia mutica</italic> EO. Sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (38.50%) and monoterpene hydrocarbons (30.59%) were the most abundant volatiles, while oxygenated sesquiterpenes (16.20%) and oxygenated monoterpenes (2.10%) were minor components [
