<p>Enantioselective GCâ€“MS analysis is an analytical technique. Its development has been accelerated by the importance of applying its results to the characterization of volatile mixtures such as EOs. In the case of chiral or optically active components, their fragrance and flavor attributes as well as their ability to act as biological mediators are dependent not only on their chemical structures, but fundamentally on their stereochemical properties [

It is very common to find enantiomers in EOs due to the metabolic response of plants; thus, there may be compounds for which one enantiomer has toxic activities while the other does not. The enantiomeric composition of the essential oil of
