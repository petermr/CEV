<p>These plants have been one of the most important sources for the search of compounds with inhibitory activity against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-26-03198" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Acetylcholine (ACh) is an essential neuromodulator involved in neuronal influx transmission [

 <xref rid="B11-molecules-26-03198" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Acetylcholine degradation is mediated by specific enzymes such as AChE and, to a lesser extent, BuChE. The low concentration of this neuromodulator is a key factor in Alzheimer’s disease. Therefore, many drugs that inhibit acetylcholine degradation are on the market, but they have limited efficacy [

 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-03198" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Our objective was to look in plants selected based on the knowledge of traditional medicine for new compounds that could regulate acetylcholine degradation. Studying the inhibition potential of plant extracts and EOs on acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase activity is thus an essential step in the discovery of new strategies to improve the quality of life of Alzheimer’s patients. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is currently the leading cause of dementia in the world, responsible for 60–70% of cases [
