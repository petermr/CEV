<p>Enantiomer components and their enantiomer excesses (
 <italic>ee</italic>) in 
 <italic>L. paniculata</italic> EO obtained from the leaves and flowers were determined by enantioselective GCâ€“MS analysis. Three pairs of enantiomers were detected for the EO of leaves, and two pairs were detected for the EO of flowers, as shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03198-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The order of enantiomeric elution was established by the separated injections of the enantiomerically pure standards.
