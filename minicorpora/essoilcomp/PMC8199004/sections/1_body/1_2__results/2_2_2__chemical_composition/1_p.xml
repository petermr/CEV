<p>Analyses were performed using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and a flame ionization detector (GC–FID) with a non-polar DB-5MS column and a polar HP-INNOWax column. The identification of the compounds was carried out with ChemStation software coupled to the gas chromatograph, which was also used to carry out the experimental comparison of the calculated linear retention indices (LRI
 <sup>Exp</sup>) with those of the mass spectra from the literature (LRI
 <sup>Ref</sup>).
