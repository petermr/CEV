<p>The 
 <italic>Lepechinia paniculata</italic> EOs of flowers showed quite remarkable inhibitory activity against both the enzymes AChE (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 28.2 ± 1.8 µg/mL) and BuChE (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 28.8 ± 1.5 µg/mL). By contrast, the EO from the leaves showed a moderate mean inhibitory concentration against AChE (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 38.2 ± 2.9 µg/mL) and against BuChE (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 47.4 ± 2.3 µg/mL).
