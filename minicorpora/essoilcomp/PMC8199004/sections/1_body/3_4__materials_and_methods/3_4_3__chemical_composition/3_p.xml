<p>Two types of chromatographic columns were used: a non-polar capillary column, DB-5MS (Agilent Technologies) (5%-phenyl-methylpolysiloxane stationary phase, 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 μm film thickness; J; W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA), and a polar capillary column, HP-INNOWax (Agilent Technologies) (polyethylene glycol, 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 μm film thickness; J; W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA), both using helium as carrier gas (1.00 mL/min in constant flow mode). The injection system operated in split mode (40:1) at 220 °C. The GC oven temperature was kept at 60 °C, then increased to 250 °C with a gradient rate of 3 °C/min. The ion source temperature was 250 °C. A quantity of 1 μL of a solution of the oil in CH
