<p>The analyses for GC–FID were performed using an Agilent Technologies chromatograph 6890N series (Santa Clara, CA, USA) coupled to an FID 7683 series (Little Falls, DE, USA) using the DB-5MS and HP-INNOWax columns. The quantification (expressed as a relative percentage) of each identified compound was performed by comparing the area of the corresponding GC peak to the total area of identified peaks (
