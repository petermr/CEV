<p>The inhibition of two cholinesterase enzymes (ChEs), acetylcholinesterase (AChE, from

 <xref rid="B32-molecules-26-03198" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], was determined by a colorimetric procedure reported by Ellman et al. (1961) [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-03198" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The volume used for the inhibition analysis contained 200 μL of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), 1.5 mM of DTNB, and the EO sample dissolved in DMSO (1%

After 10 min of preincubation, the acetylcholine iodide substrate (1.5 mM) was added to start the reaction. After 30 min at 30 °C, the 96-well microplates were read on a PherastarFS detection kit (BMG Labtech). The measurements were made in triplicate for the EO of leaves and flowers. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated using the GNUPLOT online program (

 <sub>50</sub> = 100 nM for AChE and 8500 nM for BuChE. For the analysis, the false-positive results (&gt;100 µg/mL), which may have occurred due to the presence of amine compounds or aldehydes, were excluded [
