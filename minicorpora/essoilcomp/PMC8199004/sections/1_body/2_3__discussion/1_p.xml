<p>Regarding the chemical composition of 
 <italic>Lepechinia paniculata</italic> EO, a previous study reported the sesquiterpenes Aromadendrene (24.64%) and Viridiflorene (12.37%) as well as the monoterpene β-Phellandrene (7.72%) as major compounds [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-03198" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, the current study confirmed that the EO from 
 <italic>Lepechinia paniculata</italic> was characterized by the following major compounds: α-Pinene, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-Caryophyllene, β-Phellandrene, Guaiol, 1,8-Cineole, and β-Pinene. These results may help correctly distinguish the species 
 <italic>L. paniculata</italic> from other 
 <italic>Lepechinia</italic> spp. since the taxonomic identification of 
 <italic>Lepechinia</italic> species is complicated by their similarity.
