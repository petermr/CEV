<p>Regarding the enantioselective GC–MS analysis, (+)-α-Pinene had a high 
 <italic>ee</italic> compared with the enantiomeric excesses of (+)-δ-3-Carene in the essential oil of flowers. By contrast, for the EO of leaves, the enantiomeric excesses of (+)-δ-3-Carene were moderate, and those of (−)-α-Pinene and (−)-Terpinolene were low. These results further confirm that chiral secondary metabolites are often present in plants as enantiomeric mixtures. The determination of the enantiomeric purity of a natural or synthetic compound is of great importance for different areas because each enantiomer of a molecule has different properties [
