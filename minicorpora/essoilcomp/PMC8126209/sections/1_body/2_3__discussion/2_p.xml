<p>In nature, one of the main roles of the plantsâ€™ secondary metabolites including EOs is a protection function against bacterial, viral, fungal, insects, and herbivore animal attacks. They are also able to attract certain kinds of insects for the pollination process. Thereby, EOs can play potential antimicrobial activity against various infectious diseases, flavoring agents in food industries, and main ingredients in cosmetics and perfumes [

In addition, oxygen-containing moieties such as oxygenated monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids have antioxidant activity more potent than nitrogen-containing structures such as aniline [

However, bornyl acetate as the main component of this EO may induce different pharmacological activities such as antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory activities. Among the EO compounds, the aromatic containing compounds such as camphene, sabinene, 2,3-dehydro-1,8-cineole, cineole, camphor, and nirol oxide have interesting antimicrobial activities as well as the aliphatic components, such as geranyl isovalerate, and Terpinen-4-ol showed potent antibacterial activities [

The oxygenated terpenoid compounds in high percentage of (AJ) EO such as endo-borneol and bornyl acetate have a high ability to penetrate the lipophilic lipids of the mitochondria and cytoplasmic membrane as well as they could disturb the structures and resulting in leakage of bacterial cell contents.
