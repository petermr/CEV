<p>In the current study, the results showed that the (AJ) EO exhibited weak lipase inhibitory potential at the tested concentrations of 50, 100, 200, 300, and 400 μg/mL, with inhibition in a dose-dependent manner and an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 51.41 ± 0.91 μg/mL; although, the anti-lipase IC
 <sub>50</sub> potential of the positive control (orlistat) was 0.13 ± 0.86 μg/mL.
