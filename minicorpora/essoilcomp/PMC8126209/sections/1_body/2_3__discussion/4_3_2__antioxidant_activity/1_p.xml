<p>The in vitro DPPH free radical scavenging assay is intended to mimic the oxidation-reduction reactions that usually occur in living organisms, and it was utilized to evaluate the antioxidant properties of various kinds of biological and chemical samples. Regarding the antioxidant activity, the (AJ) EO was able to reduce DPPH radicals into the natural DPPH-H form, and this effect occurred in a dose-dependent manner. In fact, (AJ) EO exhibited potent antioxidant activity, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 2.18 ± 0.24 µg/mL and 74.88% antioxidant potential compared with Trolox, which has an antioxidant IC
 <sub>50</sub> dose of 1.58 ± 1.49 µg/mL. In fact, Trolox is a vitamin E analog with powerful antioxidant properties, and it is used in different biochemical or biological applications to prevent the production of harmful free radicals and to decrease the damage caused by oxidative stress.
