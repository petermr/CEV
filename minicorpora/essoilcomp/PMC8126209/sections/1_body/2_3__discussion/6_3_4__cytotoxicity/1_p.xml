<p>To understand the effect of the (AJ) EO on human cancer cells, the current investigation was carried out utilizing cultured HeLa, Caco-2, MCF-7, and Hep3B tumor cell lines. Viability results were measured using the trypan blue MTS assay. The results revealed that incubation of tumor cells with the (AJ) EO (1.25, 0.625, 0.3125, 0.15625, and 0.078125 mg/mL) for 24 h reduced the viability of these cells in a dose-dependent manner. The number of dead cells increased by increasing the concentration of the (AJ) EO. The highest cytotoxic effect was observed against MCF-7 followed by Caco-2, Hep3B and HeLa cancer cells, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 255 ± 2.11, 379.12 ± 1.98, 440.12 ± 3.11 and 15,412 ± 2.2 µg/mL, respectively, compared with the potential anticancer drug doxorubicin (positive control), which had cytotoxic IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.43 ± 0.06, 0.37 ± 0.08, 1.21 ± 0.05, and 0.84 ± 0.03 µg/mL, respectively.
