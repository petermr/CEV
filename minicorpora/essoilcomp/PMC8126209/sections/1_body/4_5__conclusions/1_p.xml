<p>Overall, the current investigation is the first one that explored the chemical constituents, antioxidant, antimicrobial, vital physiological enzymes inhibitory and cytotoxic effects of (AJ) EO. The results revealed that oxygenated terpenoids including bornyl acetate and endo-borneol presented are the major components of the (AJ) EO. Compared with the used positive controls, the (AJ) EO has strong antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, anti-α-amylase, anti-α-glucosidase, and COX inhibitory effects which could be a favorite candidate for the treatment of oxidative stress, microbial resistance, diabetes mellitus, and inflammatory diseases. Preclinical and clinical investigations are required to be conducted on the use of this plant species and further in-depth investigations are urgently crucial to explore the importance of such medicinal plants in pharmaceutical production.</p>
