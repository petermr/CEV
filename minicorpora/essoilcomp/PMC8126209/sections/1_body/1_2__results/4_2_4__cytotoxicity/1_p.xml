<p>After treatment of HeLa, MCF-7, Caco-2, and Hep3B tumor cells with five different concentrations of (AJ) EO, the MTS assay results showed that the EO has cytotoxic activity against all the screened tumor cells as presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02831-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. However, the cell viability percentage of the AJ EOs was calculated against all cancer cell at concentration 1 mg/mL and presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02831-f006">Figure 6</xref>. It was clear that the EOs has potent cytotoxic activities against Caco-2 and hepG2 with cell viability percentage 11.33% and 19.19%, respectively. In contrast the cell viability percentage was high at this concentration against HeLa and MCF-7.
