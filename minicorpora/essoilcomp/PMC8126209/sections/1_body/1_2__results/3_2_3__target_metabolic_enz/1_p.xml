<p>The EO of the (AJ) plant showed dose-dependent inhibitory activity against porcine pancreatic lipase, α-amylase, and α-glucosidase, compared with the positive controls, which were the anti-obesity drug orlistat and the antidiabetic medication acarbose. The results arising from the lipase, α-amylase, and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities evaluations of the (AJ) EO are shown in
