<p>The antimicrobial activity of (AJ) EO was established using the broth microdilution method. The (AJ) EO inhibited the growth of most of the tested microbial strains. 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02831-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> depicts that (AJ) EO has remarkable antimicrobial effects against MRSA,
