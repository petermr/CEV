<p>A stock solution (1 mg/mL) was prepared by dissolving 25 mg of the (AJ) EO in a small amount of 10% DMSO. Then, a buffer solution was added to 25 mL. The solution was then diluted with the buffer to obtain different dilutions (10, 50, 70, 100, and 500 μg/mL). Later on, the porcine pancreatic α-amylase enzyme (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) stock solution (2 units/mL) was made by mixing 12.5 mg of α-amylase powder with a minimum amount of 10% DMSO, and the volume was completed with a buffer solution to 100 mL. Then, corn starch (Alzahraa company, Palestine) solution was prepared by dissolving 1 g of starch in 100 mL of distilled water. Two hundred microliters of the (AJ) EO stock solution were mixed with 200 μL of the α-amylase stock solution, and the solution was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in a water bath. After that, 200 μL of corn starch solution was added and incubated for 3 min at 30 °C. Moreover, 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (Sigma, India) was added and boiled in a water bath at 85–90 °C for 10 min, and after the solution was cooled, 5 mL of distilled water was added. The blank solution was prepared by replacing the (AJ) plant EO with 200 μL of a buffer solution. Acarbose was used as a positive reference compound while the absorbance was assessed at 540 nm using a UV–Vis- spectrophotometer. The α-amylase inhibitory potential was calculated by the following formula:
 <disp-formula>I (%) = [ABS
  <sub>blank</sub> − ABS
  <sub>test</sub>]/[ABS
  <sub>blank</sub>] × 100%
  <label>(4)</label>
 </disp-formula> where I (%)  is the α-amylase inhibitory percentage [
