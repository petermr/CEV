<p>In July 2020, the leaves of the (AJ) plant were collected in Hebron’s southern area, near Palestine’s Al-Naqab desert. Dr. Nidal Jaradat, a pharmacognosist at An-Najah National University’s Pharmacy Department, described the plant, and the voucher specimen was stored in the Herbal Products Laboratory (Pharm-PCT-237). The collected materials were cleaned and dried at ordinary room temperature (25 ± 4 °C) and humidity (50 ± 6% RH) in the shade for 17 days. The dried leaves were then coarsely ground and kept in glass jars for further use.</p>
