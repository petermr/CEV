<p>The antibacterial effect of (AJ) EO was determined utilizing several strains of bacteria, which were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC): 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (ATCC 9027), 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ATCC 25922), 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic> (ATCC 13883), 
 <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic> (ATCC 8427), and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC 25923), and from a diagnostically confirmed methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA). The antifungal activity of (AJ) EO was evaluated against the growth of 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (ATCC 90028). The antimicrobial activity of the (AJ) EO used in this study was estimated using the broth microdilution method. The (AJ) EO was dissolved in DMSO to a concentration of 200 µg/mL. The produced solution was serially micro-diluted (2-fold) 10 times in sterile Mueller–Hinton broth (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The dilution processes were performed under aseptic conditions in 96-well plates. In the micro-wells that were assigned to evaluate the antibacterial activity of (AJ) EO, micro-well number 11 contained plant-free Mueller–Hinton broth, which was used as a positive control for microbial growth. Micro-well number 12 contained plant-free and microbial-free Mueller–Hinton broth, which was used as a negative control for microbial growth. Micro-wells numbered 1–11 were inoculated aseptically with the test microbes. The (AJ) EO antimicrobial activity was determined in triplicate. All the inoculated plates were incubated at 35 °C. Regarding 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, the same method was used but using RPMI media (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) instead of Mueller–Hinton broth. The incubation period lasted for about 18–24 h for those plates inoculated with the test bacterial strains and for about 48 h for those plates inoculated with 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. The lowest concentration of (AJ) EO at which no visible microbial growth was observed in the micro-well was considered as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the examined EO. Antimicrobial activity was evaluated using known antimicrobial agents, namely ampicillin and ciprofloxacin, which were used as positive controls for antibacterial activity, and fluconazole, which was used as the positive control for antifungal activity [
