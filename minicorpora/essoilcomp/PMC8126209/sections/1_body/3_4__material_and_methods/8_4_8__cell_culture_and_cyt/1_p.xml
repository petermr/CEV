<p>The liver (Hep3B), breast (MCF-7), Human cervical (HeLa), and Colon (CACO-2) tumor cell lines were cultivated separately in RPMI-1640 media (Sigma, Norwich, UK), which was treated with 1% 
 <italic>L</italic>-glutamine (Sigma, London, UK), 1% penicillin/streptomycin antibiotics (BI, New Delhi, India), and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cancer cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Cells were seeded at 2.6 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well in a 96-well plate. After 48 h, cancer cells were incubated with various concentrations (500, 120, 60, 30, and 10 µg/mL) of the (AJ) EO and doxorubicin (positive control) for 24 h. Cell viability was evaluated by the CellTilter 96
 <sup>®</sup> Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation (MTS) Assay according to the manufacturer’s directions (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA). At the end of the treatment, 20 μL of MTS solution per 100 μL of media was added to each well, and the solutions in the well plates were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The absorbance was measured at 490 nm [
