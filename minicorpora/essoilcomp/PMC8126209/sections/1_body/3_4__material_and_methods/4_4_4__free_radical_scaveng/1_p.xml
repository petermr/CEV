<p>One hundred mg of (AJ) EO was dissolved in 100 mL of methanol to create the stock solution (1 mg/mL). The obtained solution was mixed with methanol to obtain different concentrations (2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 80, and 100 μg/mL). One milliliter of stock solution and 1 mL of methanol were mixed with 1 mL of DPPH (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany). Then, the solution was kept in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. However, by replacing the plant EO solution with methanol, the blank solution was prepared. Trolox (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was utilized as a positive control, and the absorbance for all obtained samples was measured by spectrophotometer (Shimadzu-UV-1800, Kyoto, Japan) at 517 nm. The DPPH inhibitory potentials were estimated utilizing the following formula:
 <disp-formula>I (%) = [ABS
  <sub>blank</sub> − ABS
  <sub>test</sub>]/[ABS
  <sub>blank</sub>]) × 100%
  <label>(2)</label>
 </disp-formula> where I (%) is the percentage of DPPH inhibitory potentials [
