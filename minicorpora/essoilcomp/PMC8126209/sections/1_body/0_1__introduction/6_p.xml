<p>Several in vivo and in vitro investigations proved that the natural plants’ EOs reduced blood glucose levels by improving the distorted pancreatic β-cells architecture of diabetic animals or by inactivation of enzymes such as α-glucosidase and α-amylase that are responsible for the metabolism of carbohydrates in the gastrointestinal tract. Overall, the antidiabetic effect of the EOs may prove to be of clinical value in the treatment of hyperglycemia [
