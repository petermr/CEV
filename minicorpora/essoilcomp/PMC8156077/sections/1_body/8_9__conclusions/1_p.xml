<p>The high cost and limited availability of antifungal drugs (polyenes, imidazoles, and azoles), rapid multidrug-resistant fungal spread, and the resistance that accompanies conventional synthetic fungicides all justify the need to develop novel strategies and alternative ways to curtail these issues, such as with plant extracts. Recently, researchers around the globe have devoted a lot of their work to exploiting certain selected plants and their metabolites with hopes of discovering new therapeutics that can thwart these resistant mechanisms and that are easily available in nature. Moreover, essential oils obtained from these plants, having antifungal properties, have more or less been categorized as approved flavors or food additives by the United States Food and Drug Administration under the category “generally recognized as safe”. Amongst these natural resources, 
 <italic>A. conyzoides</italic> has been privileged enough to draw the attention of scientists worldwide, and it seems to carry the potential of introducing a fresh approach into contemporary medicine. Owing to its encroachment upon an outsized region, this plant may deliver an economical source of an appreciated fungi-toxicant. Affirmative clinical introductory assays conducted on the plant have undoubtedly validated its great commercial importance in some tropical nations. Nevertheless, more clinical studies are needed to launch the plant at commercial scale and provide a range of novel valuable natural antifungals.
