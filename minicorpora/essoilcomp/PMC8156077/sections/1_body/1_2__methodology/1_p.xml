Searches were conducted without imposing any language restrictions and using keywords: “
 <italic>A. conyzoides</italic>“ and/or paired with “antifungal”, “natural”, “precocene II”, and “phytochemistry”. The current review highlights the traditional uses of the various parts of 
 <italic>A. conyzoides</italic> across the world, the activity of the different extracts or oil obtained from the plant against important fungal strains, together with either acute or chronic toxicological studies performed on the plant to frame its safety for humans.
