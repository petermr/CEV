<p>Herbal medicinal resources are deliberated as being a vital part of nature. For many years, novel active constituents, particularly those of natural origin, have been of great interest to researchers owing to their exclusive chemical frames and potent bioactivities. The importance of plant actives in the development of novel drugs can be judged by the fact that most of the therapeutic agents approved in last century were derived from plants or natural sources [

Preferably, new-fangled herbal fungicides should contribute improvements in target specificity, broad-spectrum activity, diverse action mechanisms, and the lack of cross-resistance with regard to the presently offered synthetic options. Many allelopathic weedsâ€™ oils and extracts have been reported in the literature as potential substitutes for menacing synthetic fungicides [
