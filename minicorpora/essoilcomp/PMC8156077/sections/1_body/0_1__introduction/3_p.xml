<p>It is evident from previous research findings that antifungal compounds from 
 <italic>Ageratum conyzoides</italic> L. can be approached for the development of safer and more economically and ecologically sound substitutes for the presently established fungicides. 
 <italic>A. conyzoides</italic> L. is an aromatic herb possessing an extensive history of benefits in traditional medicine around the world. A variety of secondary metabolites belonging to different chemical classes such as flavonoids, alkaloids, chromene, terpenoids, coumarins, and sterols from 
 <italic>A. conyzoides</italic> have been isolated and characterized. Furthermore, investigations have also reported the presence of a vast variety of phytoconstituents in the herb’s essential oil, such as benzofurans (precocene I, precocene II, and ageratochromene dimer), coumarin, chromene, flavonoids (kaempferol, quercetin, quercetin-3-rhamnopiranoside), alkaloids (caffeic acid, echinatine, phytol, and pyrrolizidine alkaloids), sterols (stigmasterol, β-sitosterol, and friedeline), terpenes (α-pinene, β-pinene), and eugenol varying in their concentrations from one place to another. These secondary metabolites are claimed to have diverse medicinal properties, including radioactive, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, and wound healing properties and many more [
