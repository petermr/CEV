 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, a dimorphic fortune-hunter microbe, holds the fourth position. 
 <italic>Candida</italic> is generally found in the intestine and in the mouth and in very small amounts on the skin, none of which is problematic. The healthy bacteria of the body keep a check on the 
 <italic>Candida</italic> level, but in conditions involving disruption of healthy bacterial levels or a less than competent immune system, this fungus can show uncontrolled growth called candidiasis. The fungus can be easily isolated from cancer patients receiving chemotherapy or from the patients with diabetes or HIV/AIDS. Fungal biofilms are resilient toward a number of antifungal agents, making traditionally used fungitoxic drugs ineffective in the management of candida fungal infections [
