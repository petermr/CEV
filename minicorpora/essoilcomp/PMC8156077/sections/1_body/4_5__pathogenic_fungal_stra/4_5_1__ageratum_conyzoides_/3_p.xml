<p>Adjou et al. [
 <xref rid="B107-molecules-26-02933" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>] recommended replacing harmful chemicals with natural antifungals and provided evidence in favor of essential oil obtained from the hydro-distillation of 
 <italic>Ageratum</italic> leaves. 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> (La3228) and 
 <italic>A. parasiticus</italic> (Ab2242) fungal growth and aflatoxin synthesis were inhibited when exposed to the essential oil. Minimal fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) reported were 3.0 μL/mL and 2.5 μL/mL against 
 <italic>A. parasiticus</italic> (Ab2242) and 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> (La3228). Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) recorded were 2.5 μL/mL and 2.0μL/mL for 
 <italic>A. parasiticus</italic> (Ab2242) and 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> (La3228), respectively, whilst the key components analyzed were precocene II, precocene I, cumarine, and trans-caryophyllene. The fungal inhibition zone was evaluated by disc diffusion method and compared with positive control, nystatin. From the studies, it was revealed that this virulent species is very susceptible to a chromene isolated from the plant: precocene II (6,7-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2-chromene). Some investigations witnessed the potential of precocene-II against the pathogenic genus 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic>. Precocene II (46.35%), precocene I (42.78%), cumarine (5.01%), and trans-caryophyllene (3.02%) were the main constituents identified by Nogueira et al. [
 <xref rid="B92-molecules-26-02933" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>] in the essential oil obtained from the leaves distillation of 
 <italic>A. conyzoides</italic>. 
 <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> growth (maximum 63% at 1 μg/mL) and aflatoxin biosynthesis (100% at 0.10 μg/mL) were inhibited when treated with the oil by causing irreversible structural changes to the fungal mitochondria. As expected, similar composition showed similar activity because biological performance is correlated with the existence of secondary metabolites. This hypothesis was later confirmed by Esper et al. [
 <xref rid="B94-molecules-26-02933" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>] when investigation was carried out about the variation in chemical composition and antifungal effect of the essential oils obtained from three different locations (Ribeirão Pires, Ibiúna, and Campinas) of São Paulo state, Brazil. Precocene I and II were in higher proportions in the oil from Ribeirão Pires (1) and Ibiúna (2), while in the essential oil obtained from the leaves collected from Campinas (3), precocene I, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene, and α-humulene were in highest ratio as compared with traces of precocene II. The percentage of fungal 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> growth inhibition was 64% and 60% by oil (1) and (2), respectively, whilst the oil (3) was inactive. Alternatively, all the three oils inhibited the fungus sporulation for &gt;120 days, which may be attributed to the synergism of the oil’s constituents. In this way, the plant has shown its potential for controlling not only fungal growth but also aflatoxin production, which is vital because consumption of toxin-affected food commodities may cause intensive aflatoxicosis in human beings. These studies also provoked the curiosity of researchers toward precocene II, urging them to explore oil’s potential against fungal infections.
