 <italic>Fusarium</italic> species is one of the economically crucial pathogenic fungal groups that is responsible for triggering many diseases in plants, for instance, head blight, cereal grains scab, vascular wilt (fruit rot), and crown rot disease, whilst the fungi occasionally affect animals. In human beings, this group is found to carry a broad range of infections from superficial (onychomycosis and keratitis) or localized invasive infections to disseminated ones (affecting exclusively immune-compromised individuals) [

 <italic>Fusarium</italic> species in humans have appeared as imperative opportunistic pathogens that can cause hyalohyphomycosis specifically in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation or in those who are burn victims. Pathogenic species of 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> are very hard to control or treat because of their resistant nature and their ability to survive for a long time in soil with or without the presence of a host plant. Often the species is isolated from the human cornea and rarely from skin, nail, tissue, pleural fluid, urine, or blood [
