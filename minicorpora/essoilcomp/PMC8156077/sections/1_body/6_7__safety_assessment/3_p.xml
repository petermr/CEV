<p>After a significant period, when the studies were resumed with the precocene II isolated from 
 <italic>A. conyzoides</italic>, the observations were encouraging as compared with the synthesized one. In an investigation conducted by Moura et al. [
 <xref rid="B141-molecules-26-02933" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>], results observed with lower doses of precocene II were quite impressive and safe. The study demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity of 
 <italic>A. conyzoides</italic> hydro alcoholic leaves extract for sub-acute (cotton pellet-induced granuloma) and chronic (formaldehyde-induced arthritis) inflammation models along with the evaluation of the occurrence or nonappearance of toxicity with prolonged use of this extract. For 90 days oral doses of 250 or 500 mg/kg body wt. were given to rats daily, and blood samples were collected and analyzed for hematological and biochemical parameters. The outcomes indicated that there was a reduction of 38.7% (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in cotton-pellet granuloma in the rats in the group treated with the extract at a dose of 250 mg/kg body wt., orally. Moreover, the plant extract significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) reduced the growth of paw edema induced chronically with no treatment-linked anomalies in either of the measured parameters. Although, in comparison with the control group, a 30.2% (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) reduction of SGPT activity was observed in the rats group treated orally with 500 mg/kg body wt. The outcomes from the study justified the anti-inflammatory ability of 
 <italic>A. conyzoides</italic> extract with no signs of apparent hepatotoxicity. Later, Igboasoiyi et al. [
 <xref rid="B142-molecules-26-02933" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>] estimated the LD50 value and detrimental effects of the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>A. conyzoides</italic> on rats when administered the extract orally for 28 days daily at different concentrations of 500 and 1000 mg/kg. When evaluated, serum levels of all the enzymes and biomolecules assessed, such as aspartate and alanine aminotransferases (ASAT and ALAT), amylase, alkaline phosphatases, creatinine, total proteins, glucose, free fatty acid (FFA), low and very low-density lipoproteins, were not found to be affected significantly except for the high-density lipoproteins and cholesterol, whose levels reduced by a considerable range. In the interim, the mean lethal dose was calculated as 10.1 g/kg, and the results of the experiment did not claim any sort of toxicity on any organ, such as bone, kidney, pancreas, and liver, when used over a period of about one month, thus appearing safe. From these studies, ethanolic and hydroalcoholic extracts of the plant seemed to be safe as the results of sub-acute toxicity tests were fairly promising for these extracts.
