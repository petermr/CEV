<p>Diallo et al. [
 <xref rid="B145-molecules-26-02933" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>] explored the sub-chronic and acute toxicity associated with 
 <italic>A. conyzoides</italic> in Wistar rats and suggested hydroalcoholic leaves extract as relatively safer. For the acute test, the rats were observed 1 h after the administration of a limited test dose of 5000 mg/kg daily for 14 days, while for evaluating the sub-chronic toxicity, oral doses of 1000 and 500 mg/kg body wt. were administered daily for 28 days. No signs of toxicity or were observed for acute dosing, nor was there any mortality. For chronic toxicity, relative organ weights and various hematological and biochemical parameters were assessed, in which no form of toxicity or any related abnormalities were observed. However, an increase in liver size was significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in the group receiving 1000 mg/kg, and urea was significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) lower in the group receiving 500 mg/kg of 
 <italic>A. conyzoides</italic> extract. After this, Diallo et al. [
 <xref rid="B146-molecules-26-02933" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>] administered 
 <italic>A. conyzoides</italic> hydroalcoholic extract in late pregnant female rats; the results showed evidence of fetal toxicity, possibly caused by pyrrolizidine alkaloids-induced oxidative stress. Although all the female rats survived throughout the study, no visible symptoms of treatment were observed. Moreira et al. and Nweze and Obiwulu [
 <xref rid="B71-molecules-26-02933" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,
 <xref rid="B147-molecules-26-02933" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>] observed a similar safety pattern as there were not any signs of toxicity reported in acute toxicity tests while they were investigating the plant for its anti-inflammatory and anti-coccidial properties, respectively. Recently, Adesanwo et al. [
 <xref rid="B148-molecules-26-02933" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>] performed an acute toxicity test with varying concentrations between 10 mg/kg to 3000 mg/kg of methanolic extract of 
 <italic>Ageratum</italic> administered in mice intraperitoneally. Extracts with concentrations of 10â€“1000 mg/kg appeared safe, but at concentrations above 1600 mg/kg, the methanolic extract became deadly. Additionally, the plant has attracted considerable attention because of its potential in minimizing the hepatic damage brought by stress or chemical exposure. Studies by Verma et al. [
 <xref rid="B149-molecules-26-02933" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>] showed that 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane and acetone extracts of 
 <italic>A. conyzoides</italic> repaired hepatic damage by restoring the normal limits of hepatic damage markers such as albumin, alanine transaminase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH-P), and conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin levels that were disturbed by acetaminophen introduction. A study performed by Ola Davies et al. [
 <xref rid="B150-molecules-26-02933" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>] was in agreement; the study indicated the potential of 
 <italic>Ageratum</italic> ethanolic leaf extract in protecting against sodium arsenite-induced toxicities.
