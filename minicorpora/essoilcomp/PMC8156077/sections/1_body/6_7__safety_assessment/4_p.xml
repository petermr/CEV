<p>Adebayo et al. [
 <xref rid="B143-molecules-26-02933" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>] performed studies with higher doses along with doses lower than those studied previously and evaluated the association between the plant and isolated precocene II against hepatotoxicity risk using Sprague Dawley rats. Four groups—A, B, C, and D of rats—were administered with 0.25% CMC-Na per kg, 500, 1000, and 1500 mg/kg body wt. of ethanolic extract, respectively. Two indices of toxicity, hematological and biochemical, were measured by collecting the blood samples from anesthetized rats, whereas for the histopathological assays, liver, spleen, and kidney were dissected. Creatine kinase, aspartate amino transferase, alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase were considerably reduced in the C and D groups, whilst mean platelet volume, white blood cell count, and percentage of platelet distribution width were found to be significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) intensified. Furthermore, the histopathological studies showed an upturn in liver and spleen weight, along with several levels of hepatocellular necrosis in all the treated sets. In inference, the leaf extract of 
 <italic>A. conyzoides</italic> was found accountable for altering the various biomarkers of skeletal and cardiac muscle disorders to a significant magnitude and certainly could be used in managing related diseases, whereas higher doses could encourage liver cell injury. In another study, Adebayo et al. [
 <xref rid="B144-molecules-26-02933" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>] probed the isolation and purification in conjunction with the toxicological impact of the isolated compound precocene II, responsible for the antifungal property of the plant. Various procedures, such as column chromatography, certain purification steps, 
 <sup>1</sup>H-, 
 <sup>13</sup>C-, DEPT-NMR, and MS spectral methods were performed to obtain precocene from petroleum ether fractions of 
 <italic>A. conyzoides</italic> L. Three groups—A, B, and C; eight rats in each group—received 0.25% CMC-Na, precocene II, 25 and 50 mg/kg body wt., respectively, through gastric intubation for 11 days. Animals were dissected on the 12th day and were evaluated for hematological, biochemical, and histopathological indices of toxicity. In conclusion, the constituent was evincing a hypoglycemic property and various hemopoietic values, such as red blood cell (RBC), mean corpuscular hemoglobin count (MCHC), platelet crit (PCT), and white blood cell (WBC) count, but no significant damage to the spleen, liver, or kidney tissues was found. Consequently, the investigations performed by Adebayo and group confirmed the safety of using 
 <italic>Ageratum</italic> for various ethno-medicinal claims. However, treatment doses and duration still need to be determined.
