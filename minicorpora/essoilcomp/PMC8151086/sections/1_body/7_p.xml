<p>While this topic seems to have a bright future, some questions and difficulties remain. One of the first challenges encountered in the development of biopesticides using volatile molecules is their short persistence (volatility, degradation, etc.) in comparison to synthetics. This can be positive in terms of environmental impacts and in terms of food residues, but the release kinetic of the compounds and their molecular dynamics have to be known and controlled to ensure the productâ€™s efficacy. The formulation thus plays an important role, and technology is evolving, as highlighted in several papers of this Special Issue, with the development of nano-emulsions and encapsulation, among others. These formulations are also important to avoid the apparition of any adverse tastes or odors on stored food products. The authors also pointed out the need for an upscaling of the tests, which will help to assess the practical applicability of the treatments. A number of compounds have proven their efficacy in vitro and seem promising. However, in vitro tests will always need to be confirmed in vivo.</p>
