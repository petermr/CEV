<p>In the last topic of this Special Issue, different authors studied the potential of essential oils as food additives or for their incorporation into food packaging. Siroli et al. firstly showed that the incorporation of essential oils into the marinade increased the sensorial perception of the marinated pork loin [

 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> L. in milk used for the production of pressed ewes’ cheese had an interesting antimicrobial effect, with a decrease in the growth of exogenous detrimental microorganisms without affecting the cheese natural flora [
 <xref rid="B11-foods-10-01062" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Ben-Fadhel et al. then highlighted the antimicrobial interest of essential oils for the treatment of ready-to-eat carrots. Indeed, their incorporation into emulsions that were applied to the carrot surface allowed the lengthening of the carrot shelf-life by two days [

 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> when applied on fresh spinach surfaces [
 <xref rid="B13-foods-10-01062" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Essential oils also emerged as interesting bioactive additives for their incorporation into active packaging. In their article, Díaz-Galindo et al. showed that the incorporation of cinnamon essential oil emulsions into thermoplastic starch leads to a decrease in the growth rate of 
 <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> without affecting the thermal stability of the packaging [
 <xref rid="B14-foods-10-01062" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. As essential oil volatility may limit their applications when the release is too fast, Maes et al. studied the potential of biosourced dendrimers to encapsulate essential oils. Their results show that stirring time and stirring rate are crucial parameters that need to be optimized for an efficient encapsulation, which paves the way to numerous essential oil applications when a slower release is needed [
 <xref rid="B15-foods-10-01062" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Bleoancă et al. studied two different treatments for the formation of edible films containing thyme extracts. Both high-pressure-thermally treated films and thermally treated ones display different structures with different abilities to retain volatile compounds [
 <xref rid="B16-foods-10-01062" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Finally, Kostoglou et al. showed the promising potential of three plant terpenoids—carvacrol, thymol and eugenol—as anti-biofilms agents, as they showed significant anti-biofilm activities against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>. Those two microorganisms are notably the cause of foodborne diseases and nosocomial infections [
