<p>Six research articles were published on the first topic, focusing on the insecticidal properties of essential oils, with the challenging perspective of replacing chemical insecticides that are widely used during crop cultivation and post-harvest treatments and therefore reducing the quantities of residues in foods. Oftadeh et al. first highlighted the high level of interest in essential oil from flowers of 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> L. in the control of 
 <italic>Glyphodes pyloalis</italic> Walker, which damages mulberry leaves and induces the transmission of plant pathogenic agents [
 <xref rid="B2-foods-10-01062" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In the second paper, the authors described the interesting contact toxicity of 
 <italic>Satureja intermedia</italic> C.A.Mey essential oil against 
 <italic>Aphis nerii</italic> Boyer de Fonscolombe, which is an insect pest in many ornamental plant cultures causing direct plant damage and transmitting pathogenic viruses. Interestingly, 
 <italic>Coccinella septempunctata</italic> L., which is a predator of 
 <italic>A. nerii</italic> and is used as biocontrol agent, was less susceptible to the essential oil. Moreover, the authors also described the elevated fumigant toxicity of 
 <italic>S. intermedia</italic> essential oil against 
 <italic>Trogoderma granarium</italic> Everts, 
 <italic>Rhyzopertha dominica</italic> Fabricius, 
 <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> Herbst, and 
 <italic>Oryzaephilus surinamensis</italic> L., which are all common insect pests in stored products [
 <xref rid="B3-foods-10-01062" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Loss during food storage due to insect infestation is a huge problem, both in developing and in developed countries. Contact chemical insecticides are therefore traditionally used to reduce food losses, with the problems of resistance appearance and the persistence of chemical residues in food. Essential oils, along with their complex composition, their low mammal toxicity and their high volatility, have emerged as promising alternatives to chemical insecticides in stored products. In the next article, Demeter et al. studied the insecticidal activity of 25 essential oils against 
 <italic>Sitophilus granarius</italic> L., which is one of the main insect pests during grain storage. The authors showed a high potential in different essential oils, such as those from 
 <italic>Allium sativum</italic> L., 
 <italic>Mentha arvensis</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Eucalyptus dives</italic> Schauer for the control of 
 <italic>S. granarius</italic> in stored products [
 <xref rid="B4-foods-10-01062" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Tanoh et al. also showed the toxicity of the newly described essential oils from 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum leprieurii</italic> Guill. &amp; Perr. against the same insect [
 <xref rid="B5-foods-10-01062" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thereafter, Owolabi et al. described the high toxicity of essential oils from a Nigerian plant, 
 <italic>Launaea taraxacifolia</italic> (Willd.) Amin ex C. Jeffrey, against 
 <italic>Sitophilus oryzae</italic> L., the rice weevil that causes high food losses during grain storage [
 <xref rid="B6-foods-10-01062" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Finally, Liang et al. showed the high insecticidal properties of essential oil from 
 <italic>Elsholtzia ciliata</italic> (Thunb.) Hyl. and of its major components, carvone and limonene, in the control of 
 <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> Herbst, a common beetle affecting many stored products, such as cereals and flours [
 <xref rid="B7-foods-10-01062" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].
