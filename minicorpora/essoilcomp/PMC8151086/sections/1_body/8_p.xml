<p>Essential oils and volatile compound activities are often attributed to mixtures of compounds. While this could be an advantage to prevent the development of resistances if they present different modes of action, as has been shown in [
 <xref rid="B18-foods-10-01062" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], with two constituents of essential oils with distinct chemical structure interacting differentially with plant plasma membrane, this complex composition presents challenges to regulatory standards, where regulations are generally designed for synthetic substances that contain a single, highly concentrated and persistent molecule. This is leading to difficulties regarding market approval by the different regulatory agencies throughout the world, as well as economic considerations. Even if procedures are sometimes available for plant-based products, few active substances have been registered so far, especially in the pre- and post-harvest fields. Uses as ingredients in food products are less problematic, as only a few essential oils have restricted regulation concerns (e.g., mint essential oils).
