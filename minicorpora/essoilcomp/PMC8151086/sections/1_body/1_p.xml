<p>The emergence of the resistance of targeted populations, ecological concern and impact on human health paved the way to the development of more sustainable alternatives to synthetic conventional biocides. Essential oils that combine highly biocidal properties with a specific or broad spectrum of action as well as a high volatility, thus limiting residues in foodstuff or the environment, are perfect candidates for a new generation of biocides. Used in plant protection as bactericides, fungicides or insecticides in both pre- and post-harvest treatments; as food ingredients to increase shelf-life; or incorporated in innovative packaging, research in the field of essential oils has a bright future ahead of it.</p>
