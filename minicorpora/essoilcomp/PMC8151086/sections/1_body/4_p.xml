<p>In the second topic of the present Special Issue, two articles described the high interest of essential oils in crop plant protection. De Clerck et al. firstly screened 90 commercially available essential oils for their in vitro antifungal and antibacterial activities against 10 phytopathogens that particularly attack plant crops and decrease food production yields. The authors highlighted that several essential oils, such as that from 
 <italic>Allium sativum</italic> L., are active on diverse pathogens and thus have a “generalist” effect, while other essential oils such as that from 
 <italic>Citrus sinensis</italic> (L.) Osbeck have an action on one to three pathogens, and thus a more “specific” effect [

In the review from Werrie et al., the authors described the high interest of essential oils for the development of biopesticides, but they also underlined the different restrictions on their use, as some of them display phytotoxicity on untargeted crops. The authors mentioned the different parameters that need to be taken into account to limit that risk, such as the mode of application, the phenological state and the product formulation [
