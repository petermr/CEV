<p>As far as the comparison between (
 <italic>R</italic>)-(+)-Limonene and Citronellal is concerned, the insecticidal activity of the oxygenated monoterpenoids is higher than that of containing hydrocarbons. This conclusion is consistent with the previous findings (

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Papachristos et al., 2004</xref>). However, these two chemicals showed significantly lower adulticidal activity than that of essential oils in this study. This finding suggests the insecticidal activity of the researched essential oil is not directly related to the content of its main components. In addition, the mode of action of these two essential oils from this study and from other similar studies remains to be elucidated (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Sheng et al., 2020</xref>). This is one of the significant barriers for the further development of plant origin essential oils whilst chemical standardization and quality control are other challenge in the development process. The study of molecular mechanisms of the active components may potentially guide the development of more efficient new vector control or antibacterial agents. Relevant research is undergoing and the results will be reported in due course.
