<p>In summary, discarded perfume lemon and leaves, which were often disposed as waste by-produces, were recycled and reused during this study. The two essential oils were produced by traditional hydro-distillation with good yields. Kovats indices method was applied to identify the constituents and their relative content in the essential oils by GC-MS. 26 chemical components were identified, representing almost 100% of the total amount. The bioassay results implied that both essential oils present antibacterial activity, especially for the Gram-positive 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> bacterial strains. Moreover, the anti-mosquito potential of the two essential oils was also clearly demonstrated in their larvicidal and adulticidal activities. Therefore, the development of the essential oils extracted from discarded perfume lemon and leaves is not only friendly to the environment and ecology, but also can provide added value to the agricultural process.
