<p>The essential oils extracted from discarded perfume lemon and leaves were prepared by traditional hydro-distillation with yield of 0.044% (w/w) for perfume lemon and 0.338% (w/w) for leaves. GC-MS was employed to identify the constituents and their relative content in the essential oils by the method of Kovats indices (Retention indices), and the results were as presented in
