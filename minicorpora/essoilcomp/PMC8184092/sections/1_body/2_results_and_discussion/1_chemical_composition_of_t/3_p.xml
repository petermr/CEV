<p>Apart from the predominant component, the lemon essential oil is composed of 
 <italic>d</italic>-limonene, γ-terpinene and β-pinene, followed by four other monoterpene hydrocarbons (myrcene, sabinene, α-pinene and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cimene) and other compounds in five different classes (sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, carbonyl compounds, alcohols, esters and oxides). In comparison to other previously reported analysis of essential oils from similar sources, most of the identified components are the same, but the composition of these components is different. For example, the percentages of citronellol and citronellal determined from the essential oils in this study are higher than in previous report and some of the less volatile components are also slightly different (
