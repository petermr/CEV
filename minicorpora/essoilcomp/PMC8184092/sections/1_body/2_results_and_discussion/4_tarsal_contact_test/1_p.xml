<p>A direct tarsal contact assay was performed for quantification of the anti-mosquito activity. The adulticidal bioassay of the essential oils extracted from discarded perfume lemon and leaves and the two main components (
 <italic>R</italic>)-(+)-limonene and citronellal in serial concentrations ranged from 0 to 650 μg/cm
 <sup>2</sup> against 2–5 days old female adults of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> were performed. As shown in 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, both essential oils revealed dose-dependent adulticidal potency and according to the nonlinear fitting curves of the acute toxicity study of toxicity regression equations (produced by the software of Origin 8.5), LD
 <sub>20</sub>, LD
 <sub>50</sub> and LD
 <sub>80</sub> values were calculated according to the fitting curve equations. The adulticidal activity of the essential oils extracted from discarded perfume lemon was LD
 <sub>20</sub> = 95.180 μg/cm
 <sup>2</sup>, LD
 <sub>50</sub> = 133.059 μg/cm
 <sup>2</sup>, LD
 <sub>80</sub> = 186.014 μg/cm
 <sup>2</sup>. The adulticidal activity of perfume lemon leaves was LD
 <sub>20</sub> = 145.071 μg/cm
 <sup>2</sup>, LD
 <sub>50</sub> = 218.962 μg/cm
 <sup>2</sup> and LD
 <sub>80</sub> = 330.489 μg/cm
 <sup>2</sup>, which were less active than the essential oil extracted from the fruit. Surprisingly, the two components with good activity against larvae when tested alone failed to produce promising activity against any of the mosquito larvae (mortality &gt;50% was observed only at the higher test dosage). In the present study, GC-MS data (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) reveals that besides (
 <italic>R</italic>)-(+)-limonene and citronellal there are many other terpenoids and related compounds present in the oil. Thus, the activity of the two essential oils against the adult mosquito (LD
 <sub>50</sub> = 133.059–218.962 μg/cm
 <sup>2</sup>) may be attributed to the additive or synergistic or blend effect of many/some of the constituents. This effect has previously been observed in some other essential oils, whose activity is due to the combination of the main components, but no significant activity has been found with single components alone (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Papachristos et al., 2004</xref>). Overall, these two essential oils have certain insecticidal activity against adult mosquitoes.
