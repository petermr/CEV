<p>The larvicidal activities of the essential oils extracted from discarded perfume lemon and leaves and the two main components, (
 <italic>R</italic>)-(+)-limonene and citronellal in serial concentrations ranged from 0 to 650 ppm were tested against fourth instar larvae of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. As shown in 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, they all showed dose-dependent manner for larvicidal potency and according to the nonlinear fitting curves of the acute toxicity study of toxicity regression equations (produced by the software of Origin 8.5), LC
 <sub>20</sub>, LC
 <sub>50</sub> and LC
 <sub>80</sub> values were calculated from the curve fitting equations. The larvicidal activity of the oil extracted from discarded perfume lemon was LC
 <sub>20</sub> = 248.60 ppm, LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 384.81 ppm and LC
 <sub>80</sub> = 595.64 ppm. The larvicidal activity of perfume lemon leaves essential oil was LC
 <sub>20</sub> = 195.73 ppm, LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 395.09 ppm and LC
 <sub>80</sub> = 797.52 ppm. The larvicidal activity of the (
 <italic>R</italic>)-(+)-limonene was LC
 <sub>20</sub> = 237.88 ppm, LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 295.28 ppm and LC
 <sub>80</sub> = 364.26 ppm and the activity of citronellal was LC
 <sub>20</sub> = 198.53 ppm, LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 267.08 ppm and LC
 <sub>80</sub> = 382.92 ppm. The activity of these two main chemical components is comparable but slightly better than the corresponding essential oils, which may suggest that (
 <italic>R</italic>)-(+)-limonene and citronellal play a key role in the effect of essential oils on larvae.
