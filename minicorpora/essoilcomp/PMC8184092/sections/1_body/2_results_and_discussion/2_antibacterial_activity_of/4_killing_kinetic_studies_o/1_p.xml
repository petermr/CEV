 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> displays the time-kill curves of the two essential oils against five bacteria strains, including three Gram-positive 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> strains (ATCC 6538, ATCC 29213, ATCC 12228), and two Gram-negative strains of 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> (CMCC 50115) and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (CMCC 44102). As presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, all the bacterial strains could be effectively inhibited at the MIC of each essential oil but with a slight growth after 10 h’ examination, which may be because of their volatility during the assay. In addition, the bacterial growth could be effectively inhibited or killed at higher concentrations of 2 ×MICs and 4 ×MICs, even till the end of 24 h assay, which is also in generally accordance with the MBCs results. While the bacteria strains were incubated with the 0.5 ×MICs of both essential oils, the bacterial concentration was initially inhibited to a certain level for several hours then gradually increased, and no inhibitory effect was observed at the end of assay. Similar growth inhibition patterns were generally observed for the five selected bacteria strains in dose-dependent manner during the time killing kinetic studies of the two essential oils.
