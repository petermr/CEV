<p>The antimicrobial activity of the two essential oils against the five different microorganisms are summarized in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. 5 μL of pure essential oil or 512 mg/mL acetone solution of essential oil on the filter paper was tested in this agar disk diffusion assay. The sizes of the inhibition zone diameters assay suggest that the antibacterial activity of the two essential oils against Gram-positive strains is higher than that against Gram-negative strains. The results also indicate that the perfume lemon essential oil was more potent than the leaves essential oil, in which the inhibition zones diameter were in the range from 7.27 ± 0.06 to 10.37 ± 0.15 mm of three tested Gram-positive 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> strains. However, both essential oils displayed no inhibitory activity against the two selected Gram-negative bacteria strains. Interesting, while testing the one of main components of the essential oils, (
 <italic>R</italic>)-(+)-limonene, showed similar activity against Gram-positive bacteria, this compound displayed higher antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria than the essential oils.
