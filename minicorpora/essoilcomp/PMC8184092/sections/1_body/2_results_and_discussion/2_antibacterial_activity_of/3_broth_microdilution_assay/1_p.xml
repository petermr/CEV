<p>Using the micro-dilution method, the essential oils extracted from discarded perfume lemon and leaves were tested in the MICs and MBCs assays and the results are presented in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The similar MIC and MBC values suggested that the two essential oils had inhibitory activity through a bactericidal effect against three Gram-positive strains of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>, with both MICs and MBCs ranging from 1.6 to 6.4 mg/mL. However, in contrast to the results from the agar disk diffusion assay, the results from the broth assays indicated that the essential oil extracted from the fruit was also active against the two tested strains of Gram-negative bacterial (MIC and MBC = 3.2 mg/mL), which mighty cause by some of the more volatile components, such as alcohols and aldehydes in the essential oil behaving differently in these two types of assays. Since both essential oils were derived from plant waste products, these findings indicated that recycling and reusing of these by-products can produce useful material with antibacterial activity. Moreover, it suggests that the physiochemical properties of the essential oils and their components may have further implication when apply this type of essential oils in future research and development.
