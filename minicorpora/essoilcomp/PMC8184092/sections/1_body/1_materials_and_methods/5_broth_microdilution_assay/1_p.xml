<p>The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined by a microdilution method in 96-well plates according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), with a slight modification (

A series of diluted essential oils were prepared with DMSO as the solvent by two-fold serial dilution starting from a stock solution of 512 mg/mL. The final concentrations of the test essential oils were obtained in a range between 1 mg/mL and 512 mg/mL. Each well received 5 μL of a specific concentration of the essential oils and 195 μL of MHB inoculated with the test microorganism (1.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> CFU/mL); the final concentrations of the examined essential oils were reached. Gatifloxacin was used as positive control and DMSO was used as negative control (

The microplates were incubated in a bacteriological oven for 24 h at 37°C, and the susceptibility results of tested samples were monitored by measuring the absorbance at 600 nm using a Multimodel Plate Reader (Infinite 200). The lowest concentration without visible growth was defined as the MIC (
