<p>The minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were determined based on the MIC results (

The lowest concentration of antimicrobial agent that killed at least 99.9% of the starting inoculum was defined as the MBC endpoint, which was determined as the lowest concentration with no visible growth of bacterial colony on the Petri dishes (
