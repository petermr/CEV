<p>The larvicidal activity was tested by immersion method in a 24-well plate according to the standard procedures recommended by the World Health Organization, with slight modifications (

Then, five larvae were transferred into the series testing solution each well for testing with no feeding during the screening. Mortality was determined after 24 h of exposure. Three replicates were carried out for each sample. The mortalities of each essential oil sample ranging from 0 to 100% were obtained. At least 10 concentrations were selected to determine the LC
 <sub>20</sub>, LC
 <sub>50</sub>, and LC
 <sub>80</sub>. Three replicates were carried out for every sample at every concentration. Deltamethrin was used as positive control while blank reference was used as negative control.
