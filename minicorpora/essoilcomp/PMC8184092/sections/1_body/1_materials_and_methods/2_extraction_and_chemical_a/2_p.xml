<p>Chemical components of the two essential oils were analyzed on a Thermo Scientific TRACE 1300 Gas Chromatograph coupled to an ISQ Qd Mass Spectrometer and equipped with a TG-5 MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness, Thermo Scientific). Helium was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The oven temperature was programmed for 2 min at 60°C, then raised to 160°C at 5°C/min and held for 2 min, then increased to 260°C at 20°C/min and maintained for 20 min. The temperature of injector and MS transfer line was set to 280°C; temperature of ion source was set to 320°C. Mass spectra were recorded in the electron impact ionization (EI) at 70 eV. The scan range was from 35 to 450 m
 <italic>/z.</italic> Identification of the components of the two essential oils was based on the search results of NIST mass spectral library, together with comparisons of commercially available standards and Kovats indices (KI). The KI was determined relative to the retention times of a C
 <sub>8</sub>-C
 <sub>40</sub> n-alkanes standard, and calculated as
