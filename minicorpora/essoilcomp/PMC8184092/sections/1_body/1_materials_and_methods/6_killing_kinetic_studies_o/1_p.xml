 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> (CMCC 50115) and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (CMCC 44102), were performed in 96-well plates, respectively. Four different concentrations (negative, 0.5 ×MIC, 1 ×MIC, 2 ×MIC) of each essential oil were studied. The microplates were incubated for 24 h at 37°C, and the growth of bacteria was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 600 nm using a Multimodel Plate Reader (Infinite 200) every 1 h (
