<p>Adulticidal bioassays were assayed using Tarsal contact assay according to the reported method with slight modification (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Chansang et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Lees et al., 2019</xref>). Firstly, a graduated series of concentrations (0∼200 μg/m
 <sup>2</sup>) of deltamethrin, essential oils and the two chemotypes ((
 <italic>R</italic>)-(+)-limonene and citronellal) sample solution in acetone were prepared. Then, the sample solution was covered on the surface of 60 mm glass Petri dishes evenly. Bioassays were conducted immediately after the 4 h drying period, at 26 ± 2°C and ambient humidity. Ten female adults (2–5 days old) were exposed in each Petri dish. A 25 mL plastic deli pot with a hole melted through the base was fixed onto each Petri dish with Parafilm. Mosquitoes were introduced through the hole and, after exposing them to the treated surface for 1 h, they were aspirated out and transferred to holding cups. Then mosquitoes were put in an incubator with constant temperature (26 ± 2°C) and humidity (70 ± 5%), and fed with sugar solution. Mortality was determined after 24 h of incubation. Three duplicate trials were carried for every concentration. Blank reference was treated as negative control while deltamethrin was used as positive control. The adjusted mortality was calculated by the formula mentioned in 
 <italic>Larvicidal Assay</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="e2">Eq. 2</xref>). The concentration is expressed as μg of deltamethrin per m
 <sup>2</sup> of surface of culture dishes. Regression analysis of adjusted mortalities vs. the concentrations of each examined sample to give toxicity regression equations.
