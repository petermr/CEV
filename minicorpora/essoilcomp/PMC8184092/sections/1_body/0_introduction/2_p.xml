 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, the discarded perfume lemon used in this study primarily resulted from commercial demand of a fixed range of fruit size, especially in the process of fruit tea preparation. Perfume lemon leaves came mainly from the pruning of perfume lemon trees, which were often discarded as a waste product, with some adverse effects on the local environment and ecology. Thus, reusing of discarded perfume lemon and leaves is not only beneficial to the comprehensive utilization of natural resources, but also can turn waste into treasure and increase the added value of the agricultural process.
