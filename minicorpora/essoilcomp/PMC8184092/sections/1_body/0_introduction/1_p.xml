<p>Many mosquito-borne tropical and subtropical diseases, such as malaria, yellow fever, filariasis, dengue, and viral encephalitis (

In addition to that, it would provide significant added value if the newly developed products can be used to control bacterial infection e.g. caused by scratching of the irritated skin or other inflammation reactions after mosquito bites (
