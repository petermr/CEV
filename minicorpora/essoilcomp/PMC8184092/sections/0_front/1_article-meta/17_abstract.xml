 <p>Two essential oils were isolated from discarded perfume lemon and leaves (
  <italic>Citrus limon</italic> (L.) Burm. F.) by hydro-distillation with good yield (0.044% for perfume lemon and 0.338% for leaves). Their biological activities were evaluated against five selected bacterial strains and 
  <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> (
  <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, Diptera: Culicidae). Chemical composition indicated that both essential oils were rich in essential phytochemicals including hydrocarbons, monoterpenes and sesquiterpene. These constituents revealed some variability among the oils displaying interesting chemotypes (
  <italic>R</italic>)-(+)-limonene (12.29–49.63%), citronellal (5.37–78.70%) and citronellol (2.98–7.18%). The biological assessments proved that the two essential oils had similar effect against bacterial (inhibition zones diameter ranging from 7.27 ± 0.06 to 10.37 ± 0.15 mm; MICs and MBCs ranging from 1.6 to 6.4 mg/mL); against 
  <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> larvae (LC
  <sub>50</sub> ranging from 384.81 to 395.09 ppm) and adult mosquito (LD
  <sub>50</sub> ranging from 133.059 to 218.962 μg/cm
  <sup>2</sup>); the activity of the two chemotypes ((
  <italic>R</italic>)-(+)-limonene and citronellal): larvae (LC
  <sub>50</sub> ranging from 267.08 to 295.28 ppm), which were all presented in dose-dependent manners. Through this work, we have showcased that recycling and reusing of agriculture by-products, such as discarded perfume lemon and leaves can produce eco-friendly alternatives in bacterial disinfectants and mosquito control product.
