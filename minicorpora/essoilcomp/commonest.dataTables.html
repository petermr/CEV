The fire ant has invaded many countries and regions and has become a globally significant pest. The current major tool to manage fire ants are synthetic insecticides that are used largely as stomach poisons in bait products or contact insecticides in spray, broadcast, drench, and dust products for area and nest treatments. In addition to these insecticide products, repellants and fumigants can also be useful in some unique scenarios. The ever-increasing public concern about the potential adverse effects of synthetic insecticides on health and the environment has been a driving force for searching for safer alternatives to control fire ants. Tremendous effort has been made in developing biologically-based control for managing fire ants; however, natural products continue to be one of the most attractive sources of safe alternatives to synthetic insecticides. Here, we summarized the synthetic insecticides that are currently used in managing fire ants, available alternative products in the current market, and academic efforts in searching for fire ant natural toxins, repellants and fumigants.">

These activities are mainly related to limonoids, a characteristic class of compounds in this family. Therefore, the aim of this review is to perform a survey of the citations in the literature on the &lt;i&gt;Cedrela&lt;/i&gt; genus species. Articles were found on quantitative and qualitative phytochemical studies of the &lt;i&gt;Cedrela&lt;/i&gt; species, revealing the chemical compounds identified, such as aliphatics acid and alcohol, flavonoids, tocopherol, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, triterpenes, cycloartanes, steroids, and limonoids. Although some activities were tested, the majority of studies focused on the insecticidal, antifeedant, or insect growth inhibitor activities of this genus. Nonetheless, the most promising activities were related to their antimalarial and antitripanocidal effects, although further investigations are still needed.">

The essential oil was released from the plant matrix and isolated by hydrodistillation. The yields obtained were 4.8 ± 0.2% and 11.3 ± 0.2% for fresh and dried fruits, respectively, one of the highest yields on record to date. Twenty-five chemical compounds were identified by GC/MS and GC/FID techniques. The principal constituent was α-phellandrene, with 50.32 ± 3.32%. The antimicrobial activity of the oil was assayed against five Gram negative bacteria, two Gram positive bacteria and two fungi. The essential oil exerted a moderate activity against &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;. The repellent activity of the oil was assayed against mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae); the samples with 3%, 2% and 1% essential oil were class 4, and the sample with 0.5% showed to be class 3.

The oils are made up of a mixture of compounds that give a characteristic flavour and odour. Currently, essential oils are receiving great attention in research for their phytochemical and antimicrobial activities. However, there is scanty information on the chemical composition of many plants. This study provides a detailed analysis of the chemical composition of essential oils of ginger, garlic, tick berry, and Mexican marigold in Kenya. The essential oils were extracted by steam distillation and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The study identified a total of 52 different chemical classes from the essential oils of the four different plants that were analysed. Their percentage composition was also found to vary between the test plants. The essential oils of Mexican marigold constituted the highest composition of the identified chemical classes at 71.2%, followed by ginger at 55.8%, while both tick berry and garlic oils constituted 53.8% of the total classes identified. Terpenes constituted the highest composition in the essential oils of all the four test plants. Other major chemical classes included esters, ketones, organosulfurs, alkanes, cycloalkanes, steroids, aromatic hydrocarbons, and alkanols. Some of these chemical compounds have been shown to have a huge utility potential in biopesticides, pharmaceutical, and food industries, and hence, their industrial extraction and purification from the essential oils of these plants are recommended.">

The total phenolic and total flavonoid contents, together with the biological activities of the derived essential oils and methanol extracts, were also investigated. Herein, the success of obtaining sequences of these plant using two different barcode genes &lt;i&gt;mat&lt;/i&gt;K and &lt;i&gt;rbc&lt;/i&gt;L were 62.5% and 100%, respectively. Both regions were discriminated by around 700 base pairs and these had resemblance with those of the Clausenae materials earlier deposited in Genbank at a 99-100% degree of identity. Additionally, the use of &lt;i&gt;mat&lt;/i&gt;K DNA sequences could positively confirm the identity as monophyletic. The highest total phenolic and total flavonoid content values (&lt;i&gt;p &lt;&lt;/i&gt; 0.05) were observed in the methanol extract of &lt;i&gt;M. koenigii&lt;/i&gt; at 43.50 mg GAE/g extract and 66.13 mg QE/g extract, respectively. Furthermore, anethole was detected as the dominant compound in &lt;i&gt;C. excavata&lt;/i&gt; (86.72%) and &lt;i&gt;C. harmandiana&lt;/i&gt; (46.09%). Moreover, anethole (26.02%) and caryophyllene (21.15%) were identified as the major phytochemical compounds of &lt;i&gt;M. koenigii&lt;/i&gt;. In terms of the biological properties, the &lt;i&gt;M. koenigii&lt;/i&gt; methanol extract was found to display the greatest amount of antioxidant activity (DPPH; IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 95.54 µg/mL, ABTS value 118.12 mg GAE/g extract, FRAP value 48.15 mg GAE/g extract), and also revealed the highest &lt;i&gt;α-&lt;/i&gt;glucosidase and antihypertensive inhibitory activities with percent inhibition values of 84.55 and 84.95. Notably, no adverse effects on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were observed with regard to all of the plant extracts. Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;M. koenigii&lt;/i&gt; methanol extract exhibited promise against human lung cancer cells almost at 80% after 24 h and 90% over 48 h.">

As they are usually only pressed at low temperatures and filtered, without further processing stages (as refining), they preserve their character that originates from the plant the oil was extracted from. Coriander cold pressed oil is gaining popularity as a novel product, obtained from its fruits/seeds; due to the high amount of terpenes, it has very characteristic flavor. A novel, vacuum-assisted sorbent extraction (VASE) method was used to extract terpenes from coriander cold pressed oil. Optimal parameters were determined. The profile of compounds extracted using VASE was compared with that of classic hydrodistillation method. Moreover, 17 monoterpene hydrocarbons and alcohols were identified with β-linalool as the main compound, followed by α-pinene, γ-terpinene, camphor, sylvestrene, β-pinene, and o-cymene. Differences were noted between profiles of terpenes after hydrodistillation and VASE extraction. For 8 out of 17 terpenes, VASE was used for their quantitative analysis. Regarding simplicity of the method, small sample requirement (200 mg) and short extraction time (5 min), VASE combined with GC/MS is well suited for characterization of terpenes in such matrix as plant oils.">

        <span class="abst" title="With insecticide-resistant mosquito populations becoming an ever-growing concern, new vector control technologies are needed. With the lack of new chemical classes of insecticides to control mosquito populations, the development of novel synergists may improve the performance of available insecticides. We screened a set of 20 plant essential oils alone and in combination with natural pyrethrins against &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; (Orlando) female adult mosquitoes to assess their ability to synergize this natural insecticide. A co-toxicity factor analysis was used to identify whether plant oils modulated the toxicity of natural pyrethrins antagonistically, additively, or synergistically. Both knockdown at 1 h and mortality at 24 h were monitored. A majority of oils increased the toxicity of natural pyrethrins, either via an additive or synergistic profile. Many oils produced synergism at 2 µg/insect, whereas others were synergistic only at the higher dose of 10 µg/insect. Amyris, cardamom, cedarwood, and nutmeg East Indies (E.I.) oils were the most active oils for increasing the mortality of natural pyrethrins at 24 h with co-toxicity factors greater than 50 at either or both doses. A number of oils also synergized the 1 h knockdown of natural pyrethrins. Of these, fir needle oil and cypress oils were the most successful at improving the speed-of-action of natural pyrethrins at both doses, with co-toxicity factors of 130 and 62, respectively. To further assess the co-toxicity factor method, we applied selected plant essential oils with variable doses of natural pyrethrins to calculate synergism ratios. Only the oils that produced synergistic co-toxicity factors produced statistically significant synergism ratios. This analysis demonstrated that the degree of co-toxicity factor correlated well with the degree of synergism ratio observed (Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.94 at 2 µg/insect; r = 0.64 at 10 µg/insect) and that the co-toxicity factor is a useful tool in screening for synergistic activity.">

Phytotoxic effect of essential oil of this chemotype on monocotyledons and dicotyledons through water and air was carried out in laboratory conditions; the broth microdilution method was used to screen essential oil effect against human pathogenic microorganisms. Results showed that α-terpinyl acetate was very rare compound in essential oil of &lt;i&gt;T. pulegioides&lt;/i&gt;: it was found only in 35% of investigated &lt;i&gt;T. pulegioides&lt;/i&gt; habitats. α-Terpinyl acetate (in essential oil and pure) demonstrated different behavior on investigated plants.

Therefore, in this work, we used a steam distillation method to obtain essential oils from leaves of &lt;i&gt;E. grandis × E. urophylla&lt;/i&gt;, and further evaluated the antioxidant, antimicrobial, and phytotoxic potential of the essential oil. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was applied to investigate the chemical composition of &lt;i&gt;E. grandis × E. urophylla&lt;/i&gt; essential oil (EEO) and the results showed that the main components of EEO were monoterpenes followed by sesquiterpenes. Among them, α-pinene accounted about 17.02%. EEO could also well scavenge 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2, 2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) free radicals showing a good free radical clearance ability. In addition, EEO efficiently inhibited the growth of six kinds of bacteria as well as seven kinds of plant pathogens, especially &lt;i&gt;Salmonella typhimurium&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Colletotrichum gloeosporioides&lt;/i&gt;. Moreover, the seedling germination of &lt;i&gt;Raphanus sativus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Lactuca sativa&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Lolium perenne&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Bidens pilosa&lt;/i&gt; was significantly suppressed by EEO, thus, indicating essential oils from &lt;i&gt;eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt; possessed an excellent phytotoxic activity. This study may give a better understanding on EEO and provide a pharmacological activities analysis contributing to the further research of EEO as a functional drug in agronomic and cosmetic industries.">

Further experiments demonstrate that ONP robustly inhibits thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), which leads to perturbation of cellular redox homeostasis with the favor of oxidative stress. Knockdown of the TrxR sensitizes cells to the ONP treatment while overexpression of the enzyme reduces the potency of ONP, underpinning the correlation of TrxR inhibition to the cytotoxicity of ONP. The discovery of ONP expands the library of the natural TrxR inhibitors, and the disclosure of the action mechanism of ONP provides a foundation for the further development of ONP as an anticancer agent.">

World Health Organization (WHO) also revealed that the prevalence of this disease will enhance (upto double) significantly upto 2030. The poor cholinergic transmission at the synapse is considered to be one of the main reasons behind the progression and occurrence of this disorder. Natural inhibitors of acetylcholine (ACh) such as galanthamine and rivastigmine are used commercially in the treatmentof AD. The biomolecules such assesquiterpenes, possess a great structural diversity and are responsible for a plethora of pharmacological properties. The potential of various sesquiterpenes as anticholinesterase has been reviewed in this article. For this purpose, the various databases, mainly PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were investigatedwith different keywords such as &quot;sesquiterpenes+acetylcholinesterase&quot; and &quot;sesquiterpenes+cholinesterase+inhibitors&quot; in the surveyed time frame (2010-2020). A vast literature was evident in the last decade, which affirms the potential of various sesquiterpenes in the improvement of cholinergic transmission by inhibiting the AChE. After data analysis, it was found that 12 compounds out of a total of 58 sesquiterpenes were reported to possess IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 9μM and can be considered as potential candidates for the improvement of learning and memory. Sesquiterpene is an important category of terpenoids, found to possess a large spectrum of biological activities. The outcome of the review clearly states that sesquiterpenes (such as amberboin, lipidiol,etc) from herbs could offer fresh, functional compounds for possible prevention and treatment of AD.">

The present contribution examines the various mixtures used for inducing sneezes (remedia sternutatoria) over the centuries. The majority of the constituents of the sneeze-inducing remedies are modulators of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. The TRP channel superfamily consists of large heterogeneous groups of channels that play numerous physiological roles such as thermosensation, chemosensation, osmosensation and mechanosensation. Sneezing is associated with the activation of the wasabi receptor, (TRPA1), typical ligand is allyl isothiocyanate and the hot chili pepper receptor, (TRPV1), typical agonist is capsaicin, in the vagal sensory nerve terminals, activated by noxious stimulants.">

Three types of glandular trichomes were detected. Peltate trichomes were present on all plant organs of studied species, while two types of capitate trichomes show different organ and species preferences. The EOs profiles differed across the plant parts, but showed a species specific composition.

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Mentha&lt;/i&gt; species are widely used as food, medicine, spices, and flavoring agents. Thus, chemical composition is an important parameter for assessing the quality of mints. In general, the contents of menthol, menthone, eucalyptol, and limonene comprise one of the major parameters for assessing the quality of commercially important mints. Building further on the phytochemical characterization of the quality of &lt;i&gt;Mentha&lt;/i&gt; species, this work was focused on the composition of phenolic compounds in methanolic extracts. Thirteen &lt;i&gt;Mentha&lt;/i&gt; species were grown under the same environmental conditions, and their methanolic extracts were subjected to the LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry) profiling of phenolics and the testing their biological activities, i.e., antioxidant and tyrosinase inhibition activities, which are important features for the cosmetic industry. The total phenolic content (TPC) ranged from 14.81 ± 1.09 mg GAE (gallic acid equivalents)/g for &lt;i&gt;Mentha cervina&lt;/i&gt; to 58.93. ± 8.39 mg GAE/g for &lt;i&gt;Mentha suaveolens&lt;/i&gt;. The antioxidant activity of examined &lt;i&gt;Mentha&lt;/i&gt; related with the content of the phenolic compounds and ranged from 22.79 ± 1.85 to 106.04 ± 3.26 mg TE (Trolox equivalents)/g for &lt;i&gt;M. cervina&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mentha x villosa&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. Additionally, &lt;i&gt;Mentha pulegium&lt;/i&gt; (123.89 ± 5.64 mg KAE (kojic acid equivalents)/g) and &lt;i&gt;Mentha x piperita&lt;/i&gt; (102.82 ± 15.16 mg KAE/g) showed a strong inhibition of the enzyme tyrosinase, which is related to skin hyperpigmentation. The most abundant compound in all samples was rosmarinic acid, ranging from 1363.38 ± 8323 to 2557.08 ± 64.21 μg/g. In general, the levels of phenolic acids in all examined mint extracts did not significantly differ. On the contrary, the levels of flavonoids varied within the species, especially in the case of hesperidin (from 0.73 ± 0.02 to 109. 39 ± 2.01 μg/g), luteolin (from 1.84 ± 0.11 to 31.03 ± 0.16 μg/g), and kaempferol (from 1.30 ± 0.17 to 33.68 ± 0.81 μg/g). Overall results indicated that all examined mints possess significant amounts of phenolic compounds that are responsible for antioxidant activity and, to some extent, for tyrosinase inhibition activity. Phenolics also proved to be adequate compounds, together with terpenoids, for the characterization of &lt;i&gt;Mentha&lt;/i&gt; sp. Additionally, citrus-scented &lt;i&gt;Mentha&lt;/i&gt; x &lt;i&gt;villosa&lt;/i&gt; could be selected as a good candidate for the food and pharmaceutical industry, especially due its chemical composition and easy cultivation, even in winter continental conditions.">

Drug repurposing and herbal medicine represent two of the most explored strategies for an anti-COVID-19 drug discovery. Clove (&lt;i&gt;Syzygium aromaticum&lt;/i&gt; L.) is a well-known culinary spice that has been used for centuries in folk medicine in many disorders. Interestingly, traditional medicines have used clove since ancient times to treat respiratory ailments, whilst clove ingredients show antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. Other interesting features are the clove antithrombotic, immunostimulatory, and antibacterial effects. Thus, in this review, we discuss the potential role of clove in the frame of anti-COVID-19 therapy, focusing on the antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antithrombotic effects of clove and its molecular constituents described in the scientific literature.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Eleutherococcus senticosus&lt;/i&gt; (Rupr. et Maxim.) Maxim. is a medicinal plant used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for thousands of years. However, due to the overexploitation, this species is considered to be endangered and is included in the Red List, e.g., in the Republic of Korea. Therefore, a new source of this important plant in Europe is needed. The aim of this study was to develop pharmacognostic and phytochemical parameters of the fruits. The content of polyphenols (eleutherosides B, E, E1) and phenolic acids in the different parts of the fruits, as well as tocopherols, fatty acids in the oil, and volatile constituents were studied by the means of chromatographic techniques [HPLC with Photodiode-Array Detection (PDA), headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME/GC-MS)]. To the best of our knowledge, no information is available on the content of eleutherosides and phenolic acids in the pericarp and seeds. The highest sum of eleutheroside B and E was detected in the whole fruits (1.4 mg/g), next in the pericarp (1.23 mg/g) and the seeds (0.85 mg/g). Amongst chlorogenic acid derivatives (3-CQA, 4-CQA, 5-CQA), 3-CQA was predominant in the whole fruits (1.08 mg/g), next in the pericarp (0.66 mg/g), and the seeds (0.076 mg/g). The oil was rich in linoleic acid (C18:3 (n-3), 18.24%), ursolic acid (35.72 mg/g), and α-tocopherol (8.36 mg/g). The presence of druses and yellow oil droplets in the inner zone of the mesocarp and chromoplasts in the outer zone can be used as anatomical markers. These studies provide a phytochemical proof for accumulation of polyphenols mainly in the pericarp, and these structures may be taken into consideration as their source subjected to extraction to obtain polyphenol-rich extracts.">

The purpose of the study was to determine the phenolic composition of the &lt;i&gt;Origanum vulgare&lt;/i&gt; extract and evaluate the antimicrobial, antioxidant, and inhibitory activities of this species that grows in the Andean region of the Atacama Desert. High-performance liquid chromatography was performed to determine the main phenols. Rosmarinic acid was identified as the predominant phenolic compound in this species (76.01 mg/100 g DW), followed by protocatechuic acid, which to our knowledge, no previous study reported similar concentrations in &lt;i&gt;O. vulgare&lt;/i&gt;. The oregano extract exhibited a content of total phenolic (3948 mg GAE/100 g DW) and total flavonoid (593 mg QE/100 g DW) with a higher DPPH antioxidant activity (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 40.58 µg/mL), compared to the same species grown under other conditions. Furthermore, it was found to inhibit α-glucosidase activity with an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value (7.11 mg/mL) lower than acarbose (129.32 mg/mL). &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas syringae&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pantoea agglomerans&lt;/i&gt; (both MIC 0.313 mg/mL and MBC 1.25 mg/mL) were the bacteria most susceptible to oregano extract with the lowest concentration necessary to inhibit bacterial growth. These results open the door for the potential use of this plant to manage chronic diseases, and they expand the knowledge of the species cultivated in arid environmental conditions.">

In the first step, essential oils from native species found in the Brazilian herbal medicine market and Brazilian species that have already shown antiviral potential were used as source for the literature search and compounds selection. Among these compounds, 184 showed high antiviral potential against rhinovirus or picornavirus by quantitative structure-activity relationship analysis.

In addition, other parameters obtained for the selected compounds indicated low toxicity and showed good probability to achieve cell permeability and be used as a drug. These results guided the second literature search which included other species in addition to native Brazilian plants. The majority presence of any of these compounds was reported for essential oils from 45 species. In view of the few studies relating essential oils and antiviral activity, this review is important for future assays against the new coronavirus.&lt;h4&gt;Supplementary information&lt;/h4&gt;The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11101-021-09754-4.">

The present study was designed to investigate the major compositions of the essential oil of this plant in Isfahan region of Iran and to identify its antibacterial and antifungal effects against 11 microorganisms causing human diseases and food spoilage. The essential oil was extracted by using the Clevenger apparatus and was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technique. Its antimicrobial activity was evaluated by well diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericide concentration (MBC). The results showed that the most important compounds of the essential oil were nonadecane (24.72%), heneicosane (19.325%), oleic acid (17.63%), and citronellol (12.61%). The results also showed that the highest inhibition zone of rose essential oil was against Aspergillus brasiliensis (15.00 ± 0.00 mm) and had a significant effect on Klebsiella pneumoniae (~ 8.00 mm). Also the rose oil had a significant inhibition and lethal effect against Candida albicans (MIC and MBC ~ 125 μg/mL), which is equivalent to the nystatin antibiotic (~ 125 μg/mL). Therefore, the essential oil of Damask rose can be considered as an alternative natural product for the prevention and treatment of fungal diseases in humans and against food spoilage as well.">

The plant growth parameters such as plant height, total fresh leave weight, fresh root weight, total biomass, total chlorophyll, leaf area, and essential oil compositions were assessed. Perlite particle size in the growing media was varied from very coarse (more than 2 mm) to very fine (less than 0.5 mm), and the ratio between perlite and peat moss varied from 50:50 v/v to 30:70 v/v. In addition, two nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) to ammonium (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) ratios (90:10 and 70:30) were tested for each growing media. The medium containing very fine-grade perlite and 50:50 v/v perlite to peat moss ratio was found to be most optimal and beneficial for E. purpurea performance, resulting in maximal plant height, fresh and dry weight, leaf surface area, and chlorophyll content. It was also found that an increase in NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;/NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ratio caused a significant increase in plant growth parameters and increase the plant essential oil content. The major terpene hydrocarbons found in extract of E. purpurea with the best growth parameters were germacrene D (51%), myrcene (15%), α-pinene (12%), β-caryophyllene (11%), and 1-Pentadecene (4.4%), respectively.

        <span class="abst" title="Damask rose (Rosa damascena Mill.) is an aromatic medicinal plant rich in bioactive compounds with high value in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. Knowledge of the factors affecting the quantitative and qualitative properties of the compounds in its essential oil (EO) and the bioactivity of this EO is important in optimizing Damask rose cultivation and production. This research studied, for the first time, the effects of irrigation water and soil chemical and physical characteristics on the EO yield of this important commercial species and on it chemical composition and antimicrobial activity. The results showed the significant effect of crop cultivation site on yield, chemical composition and inhibition zone diameter (IZD) at the 1% significance level. The highest EO yield (~0.0266%), which belonged to the Noushabad site (EON), resulted from the increased soil electrical conductivity (EC) and the higher sand, gypsum and lime contents and irrigation water salinity. Analysis of the chemical composition of the EOs showed that their main compounds at all three crop sites were citronellol, nonadecane, heneicosane and geraniol. The EO obtained from the Yazdel site (EOY) had the highest contents of citronellol and geraniol (~29.05% and ~6.85%) that were directly correlated with soil potassium and phosphorus contents and inversely correlated with soil acidity and EC and its lime, nitrogen, and organic carbon contents. Antimicrobial assays indicated that the EO extracted from the Sefidshahr site (EOS), which had the largest inhibition zone diameter (~14.67 mm) for Aspergillus brasiliensis (IZD~14.67 mm) and the lowest MIC (~31.25 μg/mL) for Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, exhibited efficacy similar to that of rifampin, probably due to the dominance of the alkanes in it. The EOY and EOS also exhibited the strongest inhibitory and lethal activity against Candida albicans (MIC and MBC &lt;15.63 μg/mL for EOY and MIC and MBC = 62.5 μg/mL for EOS), which were six and four times stronger than those of nystatin, respectively. Therefore, the selected EOs can act as a potentially promising strategy for fighting microbial strains.">

Our results showed that carvone, as a major constituent of the &lt;i&gt;M. spicata&lt;/i&gt; EO, was contained in the leaves (mean concentrations ranging from 3.39 to 19.7 ng g&lt;sub&gt;DW&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) and emitted at a constant rate of approximately 0.2 ng g&lt;sub&gt;DW&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Trans&lt;/i&gt;-cinnamaldehyde, &lt;i&gt;C. cassia&lt;/i&gt;'s major component, accumulated in the leaves (mean concentrations of 83.46 and 350.54 ng g&lt;sub&gt;DW&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) without being emitted. Furthermore, our results highlighted the increase in various VOCs following EO injection, both in terms of leaf-contained VOCs, such as methyl salicylate, and in terms of leaf-emitted VOCs, such as caryophyllene. Principal component analysis (PCA) highlighted differences in terms of VOC profiles. In addition, an analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) revealed that the VOC profiles were significantly impacted by the treatment. Maximum yields of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) were within the range of 0.80-0.85, indicating that the trees remained healthy throughout the experiment. Our targeted analysis demonstrated the systemic translocation of EOs through the plant's vascular system. The untargeted analysis, on the other hand, highlighted the potential systemic acquired resistance (SAR) induction by these EOs. Lastly, &lt;i&gt;C. cassia&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;M. spicata&lt;/i&gt; EOs did not appear phytotoxic to the treated trees, as demonstrated through chlorophyll fluorescence measurements. Hence, this work can be seen as a proof of concept for the use of trunk-injected EOs given the systemic translocation, increased production and release of biogenic VOCs (BVOCs) and absence of phytotoxicity. Further works should focus on the ecological impact of such treatments in orchards, as well as apple quality and production yields.">

BVDV is responsible for several clinical manifestations in bovines, including respiratory, gastroenteric, and reproductive diseases, with a significant economic impact. With the aim to individuate the constituent of the &lt;i&gt;Salvia officinalis&lt;/i&gt; responsible for the biological activity, we tested the major components of the oil: camphene, β-pinene, limonene, 1,8-cineole, cis-thujone, camphor, (E)-caryophyllene, and α-humulene. Here, we describe α-humulene as an active component that is non-cytotoxic and active against BVDV (EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 36 µM). Its antiviral effects were evaluated using virucidal cytopathic effect inhibition and viral yield reduction assays. This is the first scientific report showing the anti BVDV effects of &lt;i&gt;Salvia officinalis&lt;/i&gt; essential oil and α-humulene as the main active component.">

The aim of this study is to assess the antioxidant, genotoxic, antigenotoxic and cytotoxic properties of characterized hyssop essential oils and methanol extracts. Chemical composition was analyzed by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography with diode array detection and mass spectrometry (LC-DAD-MS), respectively. Antioxidant activity was examined by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP) tests; genotoxic and antigenotoxic activity were examined by the comet assay, while cytotoxicity was evaluated by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide dye (MTT) test against tumor cell lines (SW480, MDA-MB 231, HeLa) and non-transformed human lung fibroblast cell lines (MRC-5). The essential oils were rich in monoterpene hydrocarbons (e.g., limonene; 7.99-23.81%), oxygenated monoterpenes (1,8-cineole; 38.19-67.1%) and phenylpropanoids (methyl eugenol; 0.00-28.33%). In methanol extracts, the most abundant phenolics were chlorogenic and rosmarinic acid (23.35-33.46 and 3.53-17.98 mg/g, respectively). Methanol extracts expressed moderate to weak antioxidant activity (DPPH IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 56.04-199.89 µg/mL, FRAP = 0.667-0.959 mmol Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/g). Hyssop preparations significantly reduced DNA damage in human whole blood cells, induced by pretreatment with hydrogen peroxide. Methanol extracts exhibited selective and potent dose- and time-dependent activity against the HeLa cell line.

The plants have different biological importance like antiparasitic, antimalarial, antihyperlipidemic, antiasthmatic, antiepileptic, antitubercular, antihypertensive, antidiabetic, anxiolytic, antiemetic, antidepressant, anticancer, hepatoprotective, gastroprotective, insecticidal, antiviral activities, and also against COVID-19. Toxicological studies showed that the plants at a low dose and short duration are non or low-toxic. In contrast, a high dose at 3 g/kg and for a longer duration can cause toxicity like rapid respiration, neurotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, etc. However, further in-depth studies are needed to determine the medicinal uses, clinical efficacy and safety are crucial next steps.">

Essential oils (EOs) were collected in different periods (before, during, and after flowering stage) from the El-Guetfa region, M'sila, Algeria. The EOs extraction was achieved using three distinguishing techniques: hydro (Clevenger trap), steam, and microwave distillations, targeting different aerial parts of the plant (stems, flowers, and leaves). The EOs chemical components were estimated using GC-FID and GC-MS apparatuses. The resulting yield of the extracted oil was moderate and ranged between 0.84 and 1.53% (&lt;i&gt;wt&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;vol&lt;/i&gt;). In total, eighty-five components were identified, in which the oxygenated monoterpenes family formed the main portion, starting from 40.56 up to 70.66%. The obtained essential oil was dominated by five major components that varied from low to quite moderate percentages: camphor (17.45-32.56%), borneol (11.16-22.2%), camphene (7.53-12.86%), 1.8-cineole (5.16-11.21%), and bornyl acetate (3.86-7.92%). The biological results of this oil pointed out that the EOs extracted from the leaves part exposed a weak radical scavenging activity afterward using two well-known antioxidant assays DPPH (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 8.37 mg/mL) and ABTS (10.84 mg/mL). Meanwhile, this oil presented strong inhibition activity against colon cancer cell line HCT116 (LC50 = 39.8 µg/mL) and a moderate inhibitory against hepatocellular cancer cells HePG2 (LC50 &gt; 100 µg/mL). In addition, this oil antimicrobial activity was quite important against &lt;i&gt;Micrococcus luteus (M. luteus&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;i&gt;, Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; CIP 7625, &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 10536, &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; ATCC &lt;i&gt;4226&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt; IPA200, &lt;i&gt;Candida tropicalis (Ct),&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Candida glabrata (Cg)&lt;/i&gt; after using Amoxicillin and Itraconazole as references.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Cistus ladanifer&lt;/i&gt; is a Mediterranean native plant from which valuable products, such as essential oil, are obtained. Manual harvesting of the plants in wild shrublands is usual during short periods of time. Their mechanised harvesting could increase the volume of harvested plants and prevent fires, further storage of the plants collected being necessary. The objective of this work is to study the influence of the storage period of mechanically harvested bales on the essential oil yield and qualitative composition. The harvesting trials were carried out with an adapted commercial harvester baler and the storage of the bales was performed indoors during 1-7 days, 15-30 days and 100-120 days. Afterwards, the bales were crushed (30 mm) and distilled in a 30 litre stainless steel still with saturated steam (0.5 bar). The essential oil components were identified by GC-MS and quantified by GC-FID. The storage of mechanically harvested &lt;i&gt;Cistus ladanifer&lt;/i&gt; does not decrease the oil yield of steam distillation on a pilot scale. However, it leads to differences in the quantitative composition of the essential oils, decreasing the total monoterpene compounds content and increasing that of oxygenated sesquiterpenes, especially when the biomass is stored for 100-120 days, without affecting its qualitative composition.">

Piper aduncum L. is a very common shrub in the Amazon Rainforest and in other subtropical areas. The objective of this review was to analyse the existing information on P. aduncum essential oil as a raw material for new bioproducts for sustainable pest disease management. With this review, we collected and critically analysed 59 papers, representing all the studies that aimed to evaluate the essential oil properties of this species as an insecticide, acaricide and antiparasitic. The chemical composition differs depending on the origin, although phenylpropanoid dillapiole is the most cited component, followed by myristicin, 1,8-cineole and β-ocimene. Between the acaricidal, antiparasitic and synergistic activities, the insecticidal effects are highly promising, with optimal results against the malaria vector Aedes aegypti, with an LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; that ranges between 57 and 200μg/mL. Acaricidal activity has mainly been reported against Tetranychus urticae, showing an LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; that ranges between 5.83 and 7.17μg/mL. Antiparasitic activity has predominately been found on Leishmania amazonensis, and antipromastigote activity has been found to be between 23.8 and 25.9μg/mL. Concerning the synergistic effect between dillapiole and synthetic insecticides, four studies on Spodoptera frugiperda found promising results with cypermethrin. In this review, we highlighted the potential of P. aduncum essential oil as a biopesticide, also focusing on the lack of information about applied research. We also provide suggestions for future investigations.">

Presently, under the concept of integrated pest management, all possible plant pest and disease control methods are integrated to minimize the excessive use of synthetic chemicals and also the incidence of disease. The potential of various essential oils against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi is being actively investigated in various laboratories across the world. Rice the most important crop, suffers from huge yield losses due to blast and blight diseases. Most of the labs have focussed to use transgenic approaches, the use of environmentally friendly natural products, as disease control strategies. In this context, we propose to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of essential oils and their ability to control diseases of rice. Seven Essential oils from seven different plants were selected for the study. The antimicrobial activity was assessed in terms of their antibacterial activity towards non-pathogenic bacteria and pathogenic drug resistant bacteria by means of their ability to sensitize the drug resistant bacteria in plasmid curing and, ß-lactamase inhibition and as antifungal agents. In conclusion, out of the seven essential oils used, lemongrass, palm rosa and eucalyptus were found to be good antimicrobial agents.">

        <span class="abst" title="Antibiotic resistance is a major global health issue that has seen alarming rates of increase in all parts of the world over the past two decades. The surge in antibiotic resistance has resulted in longer hospital stays, higher medical costs, and elevated mortality rates. Constant attempts have been made to discover newer and more effective antimicrobials to reduce the severity of antibiotic resistance. Plant secondary metabolites, such as essential oils, have been the major focus due to their complexity and bioactive nature. However, the underlying mechanism of their antimicrobial effect remains largely unknown. Understanding the antimicrobial mode of action of essential oils is crucial in developing potential strategies for the use of essential oils in a clinical setting. Recent advances in genomics and proteomics have enhanced our understanding of the antimicrobial mode of action of essential oils. We might well be at the dawn of completing a mystery on how essential oils carry out their antimicrobial activities. Therefore, an overview of essential oils with regard to their antimicrobial activities and mode of action is discussed in this review. Recent approaches used in identifying the antimicrobial mode of action of essential oils, specifically from the perspective of genomics and proteomics, are also synthesized. Based on the information gathered from this review, we offer recommendations for future strategies and prospects for the study of essential oils and their function as antimicrobials.">

The extracts of the leaves and roots of O. cufodontii after silica gel column chromatography furnished compounds 1-5, compounds 3 and 4 are new natural products. The oil from the hydro-distillation of the leaves, after analyzed with GC-MS, has led to the identification of β-caryophyllene as a principal component, suggesting the essential oil as medicine and spices to enhance the taste of food. The constituents of O. cufodontii were assessed for their antibacterial activity against E. coli, K. pneumonia, S. typhymurium and S. aureus. The best activity was displayed against S. aureus by the hexane extract of the roots, compound 4, and the essential oil with an inhibition zone of 17, 15, and 19 mm, respectively. Molecular docking analysis revealed that compound 1 has better docking efficiency and forms hydrophobic interactions with five amino acids (ARG192, PHE196, GLU185, GLU193, and LYS189). This suggests that the compounds may act as potential inhibitors of DNA gyrase. The constituents were also assessed for their antioxidant activities using DPPH, ferric thicyanate and ferric reducing power assay. The hexane extracts of the roots inhibited the DPPH radical and peroxide formation by 90.5 and 83%, respectively, suggesting the potential of the extract as an antioxidant. Furthermore, the hexane extract of the roots of O. cufodontii exhibited the maximum reducing power compared with the EtOAc and methanol extracts. Hence, the activity displayed herein indicated as the plant has great potential as a remedy for diseases caused by bacteria and radicals.">

In the Ethiopian folk medicine, the decoction is orally taken as a remedy to treat diabetes and high blood pressure. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the antioxidant and antihyperglycemic effects of the aqueous extract and of the essential oil of &lt;i&gt;Thymus serrulatus&lt;/i&gt;. The chemical composition of the aqueous extract was determined by LC-MS and the essential oil was characterized by GC-MS analysis. Radical scavenging assays, namely scavenging of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;), hydroxyl (&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH), and nitric oxide (&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;NO), were used as a first approach to screen the potential antioxidant abilities of the samples. Alpha-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitory studies were also employed to evaluate the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; antihyperglycemic potential of the plant. The &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; blood glucose lowering effect of the extracts was assessed using hypoglycemic activity and the oral glucose tolerance test in normal and in streptozotocin induced diabetic mice. When compared to the aqueous extract, the essential oil showed superior radical scavenging activity, particularly for &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;NO, as well as greater inhibitory potency against α-amylase and α-glucosidase (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.01 mg/ml and 0.11 mg/ml, respectively). Both tested samples showed a statistically significant antihyperglycemic effect. The aqueous extract at 600 mg/kg exerted maximum antihyperglycemic activity (44.14%), followed by the essential oil (30.82%). Body weight and glucose tolerance parameters were also improved by the samples both in normal and diabetic mice. The findings of this study support the hypothesis that aqueous extract and essential oil of &lt;i&gt;T. serrulatus&lt;/i&gt; are promising therapeutic agents.">

We imaged the three essential oils perillaldehyde, β-caryophyllene, and rosmarinic acid (RA). Perillaldehyde was derivatized using glycine to prevent evaporation and allow its detection and imaging while localized in oil glands. β-caryophyllene also localized in the oil glands and not in the epidermis region. RA was detected throughout the leaf, including the oil glands. Quantitative data for the three essential oils were obtained by gas chromatography- or liquid chromatography-MS.

        <span class="abst" title="The genus &lt;i&gt;Stachys&lt;/i&gt; is a member of the Lamiaceae family. These are important medicinal plants which grow all over the world and are known for their flavoring and therapeutic effects and &lt;i&gt;Stachys lavandulifolia&lt;/i&gt; is an endemic species of Iran. To acquire high-quality essential oil (EO), drying technique was implemented which is an essential part of this process. The present study designed to evaluate the influences of different drying techniques (fresh sample, shade, sunlight, freeze-drying, microwave, and oven-drying (40, 60, and 80°C) on EO yield and composition of &lt;i&gt;S. lavandulifolia&lt;/i&gt;. The results indicated that the maximum EO yield was obtained by the shade-drying method. The main compounds found in the fresh samples were spathulenol, myrcene, β-pinene, δ-cadinene, and α-muurolol, while spathulenol, cyrene, δ-cadinene, p-cymene, decane, α-terpinene, β-pinene, and intermedeol were found to be the dominant compounds in the dry samples. Drying techniques were found to have a significant impact on the values of the main compositions, for example, monoterpene hydrocarbons such as α-pinene, β-pinene, myrcene, and β-phellandrene were significantly reduced by microwave drying, oven-drying (40, 60, and 80°C), and sunlight-drying methods. Drying techniques increased the antioxidant activity of &lt;i&gt;S. lavandulifolia&lt;/i&gt; EOs especially those acquired by freeze-drying with the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) values 101.8 ± 0.8 mg/ml in DPPH assay and 315.2 ± 2.1 mg/ml in decreasing power assay. As a result, shade-, sun-, and oven-drying (40°C) were found to be the most important techniques for attaining maximum yields of EO.">

        <span class="abst" title="This article is devoted to some aspects of the fragrant substances of plant origin applied in the food industry and perfumery as well. Since antiquity many extractive techniques have been developed to obtain essential oils. Some of them are still applied, but new ones, like microwave or ultrasound-assisted extractions, are more and more popular and they save time and cost. Independently of the procedure, the resulting essential oils are the source of many so-called isolates. These can be applied as food additives, medicines, or can be used as starting materials for organic synthesis. Some substances exist in very small amounts in plant material so the extraction is not economically profitable but, after their chemical structures were established and synthetic procedures were developed, in some cases they are prepared on an industrial scale. The substances described below are only a small fraction of the 2000-3000 fragrant molecules used to make our life more enjoyable, either in food or perfumes. Additionally, a few examples of allelopathic fragrant compounds, present in their natural state, will be denoted and some of their biocidal features will be mentioned as an arising &quot;green&quot; knowledge in agriculture.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Artemisia abrotanum&lt;/i&gt; L. (southern wormwood) is a plant species with an important position in the history of European and Asian medicine. It is a species famous as a medicinal plant in Central Asia, Asia Minor, and in South-East and Central Europe. The raw materials obtained from this species are &lt;i&gt;Abrotani herba&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Abrotani folium&lt;/i&gt;. In the traditional European medicine, they have been used successfully most of all in liver and biliary tract diseases, in parasitic diseases in children and as antipyretic medication. In the official European medicine, this plant species is recommended by the French Pharmacopoeia for use in homeopathy. In many European countries, it is used traditionally in allopathy. The latest studies on the biological activity of extracts from the aboveground parts of the plant and/or the leaves, and/or the essential oil have provided evidence of other possible applications related to their antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant, anticancer, and antiallergic properties. The latest studies have also focused on the repellent activity of the essential oil of this species and the possibility to use it in the prevention of diseases in which insects are the vectors. The main substances obtained from the plant that are responsible for this activity are: the essential oil, coumarins, phenolic acids, and flavonoids. Some of the latest investigations emphasize the large differences in the composition of the essential oil, determined by the geographical (climatic) origin of the plant. &lt;i&gt;A. abrotanum&lt;/i&gt; is recommended by the European Cosmetic Ingredients Database (CosIng) as a source of valuable cosmetic ingredients. Additionally, the leaves of this species possess a well-established position in the food industry. This plant species is also the object of biotechnological studies.">

The current investigation aimed, for the first time, to characterize the (AJ) essential oil (EO) components and evaluate EO's antioxidant, anti-obesity, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and cytotoxic activities. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) technique was utilized to characterize the chemical ingredients of (AJ) EO, while validated biochemical approaches were utilized to evaluate the antioxidant, anti-obesity and antidiabetic. The microbicidal efficacy of (AJ) EO was measured utilizing the broth microdilution assay. Besides, the cytotoxic activity was estimated utilizing the (MTS) procedure. Finally, the anti-inflammatory activity was measured utilizing a COX inhibitory screening test kit. The analytical investigation revealed the presence of 19 molecules in the (AJ) EO. Oxygenated terpenoids, including bornyl acetate (63.40%) and endo-borneol (17.75%) presented as major components of the (AJ) EO. The EO exhibited potent antioxidant activity compared with Trolox, while it showed a weak anti-lipase effect compared with orlistat. In addition, the tested EO displayed a potent α-amylase suppressing effect compared with the positive control acarbose. Notably, the (AJ) EO exhibited strong α-glucosidase inhibitory potential compared with the positive control acarbose. The EO had has a cytotoxic effect against all the screened tumor cells. In fact, (AJ) EO showed potent antimicrobial properties. Besides, the EO inhibited the enzymes COX-1 and COX-2, compared with the anti-inflammatory drug ketoprofen. The (AJ) EO has strong antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, anti-α-amylase, anti-α-glucosidase, and COX inhibitory effects which could be a favorite candidate for the treatment of various neurodegenerative diseases caused by harmful free radicals, microbial resistance, diabetes, and inflammations. Further in-depth investigations are urgently crucial to explore the importance of such medicinal plants in pharmaceutical production.">

Essential oils are widely used as supportive ingredients in many diseases, especially in the acute and chronic diseases of the respiratory tract. Neuroinflammation is responsible for several diseases of the central nervous system. Some plant-derived bioactive molecules have been shown to have role in attenuating neuroinflammation by regulating microglia, the immune cells of the CNS.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;In this study, the anti-inflammatory effect of three chemotypes of thyme essential oil and their main compounds (geraniol, thujanol and linalool) were examined on lipopolysaccharide-induced BV-2 microglia. Three different experimental setups were used, LPS pretreatment, essential oil pretreatment and co-treatments of LPS and essential oils in order to determine whether essential oils are able to prevent inflammation and can decrease it. The concentrations of the secreted tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) proinflammatory cytokines were measured and we analysed by Western blot the activity of the cell signalling pathways, NF-κB and CCAAT-enhancer binding protein β (C/EBPβ) regulating TNFα and IL-6 proinflammatory cytokine expressions in BV-2 cells.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Our results showed definite alterations in the effects of essential oil chemotypes and their main compounds at the different experimental setups. Considering the changes of IL-6 and TNFα secretions the best reduction of inflammatory cytokines could be reached by the pretreatment with the essential oils. In addition, the main compounds exerted better effects than essential oil chemotypes in case of LPS pretreatment. At the essential oil pretreatment experiment, the effect of linalool and geraniol was outstanding but there was no major difference between the actions of chemotypes and standards. Main compounds could be seen to have large inhibitory effects on certain cell signalling components related to the activation of the expression of proinflammatory cytokines.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Thyme essential oils are good candidates to use in prevention of neuroinflammation and related neurodegeneration, but the exact ratio of the components has to be selected carefully.">

In experiment 1, LEM tended to increase the propionate proportion and tended to decrease the acetate to propionate ratio. Anise star, COR, and thyme tended to increase butyrate proportion. Capsicum, COR, and thyme decreased ammonia-N concentration. In experiment 2, a synergy was observed between LEM and COR that resulted in an increase in total volatile fatty acids and propionate proportion, and a decrease in the acetate to propionate ratio. However, the addition of high doses of GIN to the mix had an antagonistic effect on the rumen fermentation profile of the LEM + COR mix. Careful selection and combination of these EO may result in useful mixtures with synergistic interactions to modulate rumen microbial fermentation profile.">

The highest essential oil yield was obtained from Bogor (1.5%), while the lowest one was from Tulungagung (0.78%). The yield was positively and significantly correlated with the rainfall, soil organic carbon, soil pH, and macronutrient levels, i.e., nitrogen, phosphorus, and magnesium. Citronellal, the major component in metabolites' profile of kaffir lime leaves essential oils, was significantly affected by the growing location. The absolute content of citronellal was positively and significantly correlated with the actual soil pH and leaf Ca content; furthermore, it negatively correlated with the leaf content of Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu. Pearson correlation analysis also showed (i) a negative significant correlation between the relative percentage of citronellol and annual rainfall intensity; (ii) a negative significant correlation between altitude and relative percentage of caryophyllene, and (iii) a positive significant correlation between the relative percentage of linalool and leaf K content.">

However, reports about its safety profiles are limited. The present study aimed to evaluate the phytochemical profile and the toxic effects of ZO essential oil on the development of zebrafish and acute oral toxicity in rats. The essential oil was isolated from ZO rhizomes, and phytochemicals were analyzed using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS). The embryotoxic and teratogenic effects of ZO essential oil were evaluated in zebrafish embryos and larvae and the acute oral toxicity was determined in rats. GC-MS results showed the essential oil contained zerumbone as a major phytoconstituent (24.73%). The zebrafish embryotoxicity of ZO essential oil appeared to be concentration- and time-dependent manner, with a moderate LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (1.003 µg/mL). Teratogenicity in zebrafish embryos also included morphological defects, decreased hatchability, and reduced heart rate. In rats, ZO essential oil (2000 mg/kg, p.o.) resulted in no mortality or significant toxicities. These findings suggest that ZO has embryotoxic and teratogenic effects in zebrafish embryos but does not result in death or acute oral toxicity in rats. Further long-term toxicity studies are needed to confirm the safety of products developed from ZO essential oil.">

Synthetic acaricides are frequently applied for controlling TSSM, resulting in environmental pollution. The utilization of rational novel substances which repel or prevent TSSM establishment represents a sustainable eco-friendly to reduce the utilization of agrochemicals. A greenhouse investigation was done for assessing the bio-acaricidal activity of mustard (&lt;i&gt;Brassica juncea&lt;/i&gt; L.) fixed oil (MFO), jasmine (&lt;i&gt;Jasminum grandiflorum&lt;/i&gt; L.) essential oil (JEO), or lavender (&lt;i&gt;Lavandula angustifolia&lt;/i&gt; L.) essential oil (LEO), and their influences on eggplant growth and productivity. The results demonstrated that JEO represents the most acaricidal properties against TSSM followed by MFO and/or LEO compared to control. Spraying with natural oils significantly improved eggplant growth, i.e., plant height, number of leaves, and branches/plant, in addition to the leaf area and relative leaf dry mass of the 3rd-5th upper leaves. The JEO had the strongest positive effect compared with other oils or control. Additionally, Natural oils application significantly increased photosynthetic pigment, chlorophyll &lt;sub&gt;a:b&lt;/sub&gt; ratio, and nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, ascorbic acid, and phenols. The application of oils increased yield and its quality. In this study, JEO (2.5 mL/l) is shown to be extremely promising for the progress of new eco-friendly acaricides, improving plant growth and increasing eggplant yield.">

Green chemistry of nanoscale materials (1-100 nm) is as an effective and sustainable strategy to manufacture homogeneous nanoparticles (NPs) with unique properties, thus making the synthesis of green NPs, especially metal nanoparticles (MNPs), the scientist's core theme. Researchers have tested different organisms to manufacture MNPs and the results of experiments confirmed that plants tend to be the ideal candidate amongst all entities and are suitable to synthesize a wide variety of MNPs. Natural and cultivated &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt; forests are among woody plants used for landscape beautification and as forest products. The present review has been written to reflect the efficacious role of &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt; in the synthesis of MNPs. To better understand this, the route of extracting MNPs from plants, in general, and &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt;, in particular, are discussed. Furthermore, the crucial factors influencing the process of MNP synthesis from &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt; as well as their characterization and recent applications are highlighted. Information gathered in this review is useful to build a basis for new prospective research ideas on how to exploit this woody species in the production of MNPs. Nevertheless, there is a necessity to feed the scientific field with further investigations on wider applications of &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt;-derived MNPs.">

The essential oil produced in mint (&lt;i&gt;Mentha canadensis&lt;/i&gt; L.) leaves is used widely in the aromatics industry and in medicine. Under low-light treatment, significant reductions in peltate glandular trichome densities were observed. GC-MS analysis showed dramatically reduced essential oil and menthol contents. Light affected the peltate glandular trichomes' development and essential oil yield production. However, the underlying mechanisms of this regulation were elusive. To identify the critical genes during light-regulated changes in oil content, following a 24 h darkness treatment and a 24 h recovery light treatment, leaves were collected for transcriptome analysis. A total of 95,579 unigenes were obtained, with an average length of 754 bp. About 56.58% of the unigenes were annotated using four public protein databases: 10,977 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found to be involved in the light signaling pathway and monoterpene synthesis pathway. Most of the TPs showed a similar expression pattern: downregulation after darkness treatment and upregulation after the return of light. In addition, the genes involved in the light signal transduction pathway were analyzed. A series of responsive transcription factors (TFs) were identified and could be used in metabolic engineering as an effective strategy for increasing essential oil yields.">

        <span class="abst" title="The worldwide problem of infectious diseases has appeared in recent years, and antimicrobial agents are crucial in reducing disease emergence. Nevertheless, the development and distribution of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains in pathogenic bacteria, such as &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Salmonella Typhi&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Citrobacter koseri&lt;/i&gt;, has become a major society health hazard. Essential oils could serve as a promising tool as a natural drug in fighting the problem with these bacteria. The current study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial effectiveness of tea tree (&lt;i&gt;Melaleuca alternifolia&lt;/i&gt; (Maiden and Betche) Cheel), rosemary (&lt;i&gt;Rosmarinus officinalis&lt;/i&gt; L.), eucalyptus (&lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus obliqua&lt;/i&gt; L'Hér.), and lavender (&lt;i&gt;Lavandula angustifolia&lt;/i&gt; Mill) essential oils. The antimicrobial properties of essential oils were screened against four pathogenic bacteria, &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;S. Tyhpi,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C. koseri&lt;/i&gt;, and two reference bacterial strains, while for the testing, the agar well diffusion method was used. Gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometric (GC-MSD) analyses were performed on essential oils. The obtained results showed that &lt;i&gt;M. alternifolia&lt;/i&gt; essential oil is the richest in terpinen-4-ol, &lt;i&gt;R. officinalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;E. oblique&lt;/i&gt; essential oils in 1,8-cineole, and &lt;i&gt;L. angustifolia&lt;/i&gt; essential oil in α-terpinyl acetate. In addition, the main bioactive compounds present in the essential oil of tea tree are rich in α-pinene (18.38%), limonene (7.55%) and γ-terpinene (14.01%). The essential oil of rosemary is rich in α-pinene (8.38%) and limonene (11.86%); eucalyptus essential oil has significant concentrations of α-pinene (12.60%), &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-cymene (3.24%), limonene (3.87%), and γ-terpinene (7.37%), while the essential oil of lavender is rich in linalool (10.71%), linalool acetate (9.60%), α-terpinyl acetate (10.93%), and carbitol (13.05%) bioactive compounds, respectively. The obtained results from the in vitro study revealed that most of the essential oils exhibited antimicrobial properties. Among the tested essential oils, tea tree was discovered to demonstrate the strongest antimicrobial activity. The recorded MIC of &lt;i&gt;S. Typhi&lt;/i&gt; was 6.2 mg/mL, 3.4 mg/mL of &lt;i&gt;C. koseri&lt;/i&gt;, 3.1 mg/mL of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, and 2.7 mg/mL of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 25922, compared to &lt;i&gt;M. alternifolia&lt;/i&gt;. Similarly, only &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 25923 showed antimicrobial activity towards &lt;i&gt;R. officinalis&lt;/i&gt; (1.4 mg/mL), &lt;i&gt;E. oblique&lt;/i&gt; (2.9 mg/mL), and &lt;i&gt;L. angustifolia&lt;/i&gt; (2.1 mg/mL). Based on the obtained results, it is possible to conclude that tea tree essential oil might be used as an ecological antimicrobial in treating infectious diseases caused by the tested pathogens.">

However, studies with livestock animals dealing with PFA as antioxidants are scarce. The aim of the present review was to evaluate the antioxidant impact of PFA compared with synthetic vitamins on animal food product yield and quality. For this purpose, peer-reviewed studies published between 2000 and 2020 were collected. Most papers were carried out on ruminants (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 13), but PFA were also tested in swine (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 6) and rabbits (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 2). The inclusion of PFA in the diets of pigs, rabbits, and ruminants improved the products' quality (including organoleptic characteristics and fatty acids profile), oxidative stability, and shelf life, with some impacts also on their yields. The effects of PFA are diverse but often comparable to those of the synthetic antioxidant vitamin E, suggesting their potential as an alternative to this vitamin within the diet.">

EOs were obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and a gas chromatography/flame ionization detector (GC/FID). Enantiomeric distribution by GC/MS was determined, modifying the enantiomeric separation of β-pinene, limonene, δ-elemene, β-bourbonene, cis-cadina-1 (6), 4-diene and atractylone. A total of 44 compounds were identified. The most representative for L1 were guaiol, atractylone and 4-diene; for L2, cis-cadina-1(6),4-diene and myrcene; for L3, atractylone, myrcene and germacrene B; and finally, L4 germacrene B, myrcene and cis-cadina-1(6),4-diene. Correlations between soil- leaf chemical elements such as Al, Ca, Fe, Mg, Mn, N and Si in the different localities were significant with chemical composition of the essential oil of &lt;i&gt;Siparuna muricata&lt;/i&gt;; however, correlations between soil and leaf K, P, and Na were not significant. Cluster and NMDS analysis showed high dissimilarity values of secondary metabolites between four localities related with changes in soil- leaf nutrients. Thus, the SIMPER routine revealed that not all secondary metabolites contribute equally to establishing the differences in the four localities, and the largest contributions are due to differences in guaiol, cis-cadina-1(6),4-diene, atractylone and germacrene. Our investigation showed for the first time the influences of altitude and soil- leaf chemical elements in the chemical composition of the EOs of &lt;i&gt;S. muricata&lt;/i&gt;.">

(Family-Asteraceae) is an annual aromatic invasive herb, mainly distributed over the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. It owns a reputed history of indigenous remedial uses, including as a wound dressing, an antimicrobial, and mouthwash as well as in treatment of dysentery, diarrhea, skin diseases, etc. In this review, the core idea is to present the antifungal potential of the selected medicinal plant and its secondary metabolites against different fungal pathogens. Additionally, toxicological studies (safety profile) conducted on the amazing plant &lt;i&gt;A. conyzoides&lt;/i&gt; L. are discussed for the possible clinical development of this medicinal herb. Articles available from 2000 to 2020 were reviewed in detail to exhibit recent appraisals of the antifungal properties of &lt;i&gt;A. conyzoides&lt;/i&gt;. Efforts were aimed at delivering evidences for the medicinal application of &lt;i&gt;A. conyzoides&lt;/i&gt; by using globally recognized scientific search engines and databases so that an efficient approach for filling the lacunae in the research and development of antifungal drugs can be adopted. After analyzing the literature, it can be reported that the selected medicinal plant effectively suppressed the growth of numerous fungal species, such as &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Alternaria&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Candida&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Phytophthora&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Pythium&lt;/i&gt;, owing to the presence of various secondary metabolites, particularly chromenes, terpenoids, flavonoids and coumarins. The possible mechanism of action of different secondary metabolites of the plant against fungal pathogens is also discussed briefly. However, it was found that only a few studies have been performed to demonstrate the plant's dosage and safety profile in humans. Considered all together, &lt;i&gt;A. conyzoides&lt;/i&gt; extract and its constituents may act as a promising biosource for the development of effective antifungal formulations for clinical use. However, in order to establish safety and efficacy, additional scientific research is required to explore chronic toxicological effects of &lt;i&gt;ageratum&lt;/i&gt;, to determine the probability of interactions when used with different herbs, and to identify safe dosage. The particulars presented here not only bridge this gap but also furnish future research strategies for the investigators in microbiology, ethno-pharmacology, and drug discovery.">

The Palestinian za'atar market has the potential to develop and increase its value. However, it is facing many challenges. Another valuable product of za'atar is essential oil. Za'atar essential oil quantity and quality are affected by many factors including geographical location, cultivation, harvesting season, soil, extraction method, temperature, and others. These factors interact with za'atar and with each other; therefore, some factors are more effective than others and further research is needed to determine the optimum condition for producing and obtaining za'atar essential oil. Antimicrobial and antioxidant activities are the main functionalities of za'atar essential oil that are behind its medicinal importance. One hundred and twenty-one compounds have been identified in za'atar essential oil. The most common compounds are thymol, γ-terpinene, carvacrol, and α-pinene. The variation in the composition among za'atar essential oil samples results from the different conditions of the studies during za'atar growth as well as essential oil extraction.">

While the biological activities of these ingredients have been investigated, including the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial activities, there is still a lack of understanding regarding the responses to the essential oils of these plants. To investigate the effects of essential oil inhalation on the brain and mood responses, electroencephalography was carried out during the non-task resting state, and self-assessment of the mood state was performed. The essential oils were prepared in several dilutions in the range of the supra-threshold level. The results show that &lt;i&gt;Litsea cubeba&lt;/i&gt; oil inhalation showed a sedative effect, observed from alpha and beta wave power reductions. The frontal and temporal regions of the brain were involved in the wave alterations. Garlic oil increased the alpha wave power at lower concentrations; however, a sedative effect was also observed at higher concentrations. Lower dilution oil induced changes in the fast alpha activity in the frontal region. The alpha and beta wave powers were decreased with higher dilution oils, particularly in the temporal, parietal, and occipital regions. Both &lt;i&gt;Litsea cubeba&lt;/i&gt; and turmeric oils resulted in better positive moods than garlic oil. Garlic oil caused more negative moods than the others. The psychophysiological activities and the related brain functions require further investigation. The knowledge obtained from this study may be used to design functional food products.">

        <span class="abst" title="The increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a worldwide concern. Essential oils are known to possess remarkable antibacterial properties, but their high chemical variability complicates their development into new antibacterial agents. Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to standardize their chemical composition. Several commercial essential oils of ajowan (&lt;i&gt;Trachyspermum ammi&lt;/i&gt; L.) and thyme (chemotype thymol) (&lt;i&gt;Thymus vulgaris&lt;/i&gt; L.) were bought on the market. GC-MS analysis revealed that thyme essential oils have a chemical composition far more consistent than ajowan essential oils. Sometimes thymol was not even the major compound. The most abundant compounds and the homemade mixtures were tested against two &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; strains.

The mixture of those three compounds at equivalent percentages also decreased by 16-fold the MIC of the penicillin V. Against &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; LMG 21674, &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-caryophyllene presented an MIC of 31.3 μg/mL and decreased by 267-fold the MIC of the penicillin V. These observations led us to question the benefits of using a complex chemical mixture instead of one active compound to fight bacterial resistance.">

        <span class="abst" title="In the present paper, we focused our attention on &lt;i&gt;Cinnamomum camphora&lt;/i&gt; (L.) J. Presl. (Lauraceae), studied at three levels: (i) micromorphological, with the analysis of the secretory structures and a novel in-depth histochemical characterization of the secreted compounds; (ii) phytochemical, with the characterization of the essential oils from young stems, fruits, and leaves, subjected to different conservation procedures (fresh, dried, stored at -20 °C, stored at -80 °C) and collected in two different years; (iii) bioactive, consisting of a study of the potential antibacterial activity of the essential oils. The micromorphological investigation proved the presence of secretory cells characterized by a multi-layered wall in the young stems and leaves. They resulted in two different types: mucilage cells producing muco-polysaccharides and oil cells with an exclusive terpene production. The phytochemical investigations showed a predominance of monoterpenes over sesquiterpene derivatives; among them, the main components retrieved in all samples were 1,8-cineole followed by &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-terpineol and sabinene. Conservation procedures seem to only influence the amounts of specific components, i.e., 1,8-cineole and &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-terpineol, while analyses on each plant part revealed the presence of some peculiar secondary constituents for each of them. Finally, the evaluation of the antibacterial activity of the essential oil showed a promising activity against various microorganisms, as &lt;i&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus faecalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;. In conclusion, we combined a micromorphological and phytochemical approach of the study on different plant parts of &lt;i&gt;C. camphora&lt;/i&gt;, linking the occurrence of secretory cells to the production of essential oils. We compared, for the first time, the composition of essential oils derived from different plant matrices conserved with different procedures, allowing us to highlight a relation between the conservation technique and the main components of the profiles. Moreover, the preliminary antibacterial studies evidenced the potential activity of the essential oils against various microorganisms potentially dangerous for plants and humans.">

The toxicity of vinegar-processed products was significantly lower than the raw, and the development characteristic of zebrafish embryos at different times confirmed these results. The volatile oil of vinegar-processed products could inhibit the growth of intersegmental blood vessels at the dose of 20 μg/mL, while the raw materials did not exhibit such effect at the same concentration. The rat experiment also confirmed that the volatile oil could reduce toxicity of ovarian and uterine.&lt;h4&gt;Discussion and conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;The study indicated that processing using vinegar could decrease toxicity and increase anti-angiogenic activity of &lt;i&gt;C. phaeocaulis&lt;/i&gt;, which could be applied for clinical treatment. Further in-depth study on the synergism and detoxification mechanism of vinegar processing technology is needed.">

All the tested essential oils significantly reduced and controlled the green peach aphid population and caused higher mortality. In this study, black pepper and tea tree pure essential oils were found to be an effective insecticide, with 80% mortality when used through contact application. However, for combinations of essential oils from black pepper + tea tree (BT) and rosemary + tea tree (RT) tested as contact treatment, the mortality was 98.33%. The essential oil combinations exhibited synergistic and additive interactions for insecticidal activities. The combination of black pepper + tea tree, eucalyptus + tea tree (ET), and tea tree + rosemary showed enhanced activity, with synergy rates of 3.24, 2.65, and 2.74, respectively. Essential oils formulation was effective on the mortality of aphids. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis showed that stability of a mixture of essential oils was not affected by store temperature (15, 25, and 35 °C) and the functional groups were not changed during storage. Based on our results, the essential oils can be used as a commercial insecticide against &lt;i&gt;M. persicae&lt;/i&gt;.">

Moreover, many compounds of this genus are known for their antimicrobial, insecticidal, parasiticidal, and phytotoxic properties, which recommend them as possible biological control agents against plant pests. This paper aims to evaluate the latest available information related to the pesticidal properties of &lt;i&gt;Artemisia&lt;/i&gt; compounds and extracts and their potential use in crop protection. Another aspect discussed in this review is the use of nanotechnology as a valuable trend for obtaining pesticides. Nanoparticles, nanoemulsions, and nanocapsules represent a more efficient method of biopesticide delivery with increased stability and potency, reduced toxicity, and extended duration of action. Given the negative impact of synthetic pesticides on human health and on the environment, &lt;i&gt;Artemisia&lt;/i&gt;-derived biopesticides and their nanoformulations emerge as promising ecofriendly alternatives to pest management.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Lantana camara&lt;/i&gt; L. (Verbenaceae) is native to tropical America and has been introduced into many other countries as an ornamental and hedge plant. The species has been spreading quickly and has naturalized in more than 60 countries as an invasive noxious weed. It is considered to be one of the world's 100 worst alien species. &lt;i&gt;L. camara&lt;/i&gt; often forms dense monospecies stands through the interruption of the regeneration process of indigenous plant species. Allelopathy of &lt;i&gt;L. camara&lt;/i&gt; has been reported to play a crucial role in its invasiveness. The extracts, essential oil, leachates, residues, and rhizosphere soil of &lt;i&gt;L. camara&lt;/i&gt; suppressed the germination and growth of other plant species. Several allelochemicals, such as phenolic compounds, sesquiterpenes, triterpenes, and a flavonoid, were identified in the extracts, essential oil, residues, and rhizosphere soil of &lt;i&gt;L. camara.&lt;/i&gt; The evidence also suggests that some of those allelochemicals in &lt;i&gt;L. camara&lt;/i&gt; are probably released into the rhizosphere soil under the canopy and neighboring environments during the decomposition process of the residues and as leachates and volatile compounds from living plant parts of &lt;i&gt;L. camara.&lt;/i&gt; The released allelochemicals may suppress the regeneration process of indigenous plant species by decreasing their germination and seedling growth and increasing their mortality. Therefore, the allelopathic property of &lt;i&gt;L. camara&lt;/i&gt; may support its invasive potential and formation of dense monospecies stands.">

Lindb. (Clusiaceae) were investigated. Free volatiles were isolated and the chemical composition was determined in the lipophilic fraction (essential oil) and for the first time in the water fraction (hydrosol). The aim is to provide phytochemical data for &lt;i&gt;H. perforatum&lt;/i&gt; ssp. &lt;i&gt;veronense&lt;/i&gt; useful for distinguishing ssp. &lt;i&gt;veronense&lt;/i&gt; from ssp. &lt;i&gt;angustifolium&lt;/i&gt;, as there are taxonomic disagreements between them and the composition of the secretory products may be helpful in this respect. In the essential oil, the most abundant compounds identified were α-pinene and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-nonane, while in the hydrosol, myrtenol, carvacrol and α-pinene were the most abundant. Overall, the class of monoterpenes and oxygenated monoterpenes dominated in the EO and hydrosol samples. The essential oil showed high antioxidant activity, in contrast to the antiproliferative activity, where the hydrosol showed exceptional activity against three cancer cell lines: Hela (cervical cancer cell line), HCT116 (human colon cancer cell line) and U2OS (human osteosarcoma cell line). Both the essential oil and hydrosol showed antiphytoviral activity against tobacco mosaic virus infection on the local host plants. This is the first report dealing with biological activities of hydrosol of &lt;i&gt;H. perforatum&lt;/i&gt; ssp. &lt;i&gt;veronense&lt;/i&gt;, and the obtained results suggest that this traditional medicinal plant is a valuable source of volatiles with promising antiproliferative, antioxidant and antiphytoviral activities.">

The extracts and essential oil were studied for &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-amylase and acetylcholinesterase activities with two different spectrophotometric methods. Antimicrobial activities of the extracts were investigated by microdilution. The extracts were evaluated &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; for cytotoxic effects against cancer and normal cell lines by MTT assay. The essential oil (EO) contained &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-pinene (12.5%) and &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-caryophyllene (10.7%) as main compounds. Palmitic&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;(26.5%) and nonadecanoic acids (26.6%) were determined as fatty acids. Phytochemical analysis of the extracts found phenolic acids, phlinosides, verbascoside, and flavonoids.

        <span class="abst" title="Infectious diseases caused by multidrug-resistant microorganisms has increased in the last years. Piper species have been reported as a natural source of phytochemicals that can help in combating fungal and bacterial infections. This study had as objectives characterize the chemical composition of the essential oil from Piper caldense (EOPC), evaluate its potential antimicrobial activity, and investigate the synergistic effect with Norfloxacin against multidrug-resistant S. aureus overproducing efflux pumps, as well as, verify the EOPC ability to inhibit the Candida albicans filamentation. EOPC was extracted by hydrodistillation, and the chemical constituents were identified by gas chromatography, allowing the identification of 24 compounds (91.9%) classified as hydrocarbon sesquiterpenes (49.6%) and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (39.5%). Antimicrobial tests were performed using a 96-well plate microdilution method against C. albicans ATCC 10231, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 standard strains, as well as against multidrug-resistant strains S. aureus SA1199B (overexpressing norA gene), S. aureus K2068 (overexpressing mepA gene) and S. aureus K4100 (overexpressing qacC gene). The oil showed activity against C. albicans ATCC 10231 (≥ 512 µg/mL) and was able to inhibit hyphae formation, an important mechanism of virulence of C. albicans. On the other hand, EOPC was inactive against all bacterial strains tested (≤ 1,024 µg mL). However, when combined with Norfloxacin at subinhibitory concentration EOPC reduced the Norfloxacin and Ethidium bromide MIC values against S. aureus strains SA1199B, K2068 and K4100. These results indicate that EOPC is a source of phytochemicals acting as NorA, MepA and QacC inhibitors.">

One of the best candidates for this strategy is a natural plant or traditional herbal medicine. This review aimed to summarize and introduce Iranian medicinal plants with anti-QS properties. Biomedical databases (PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and Web of sciences) were investigated to retrieve all related manuscripts published in English and Persian. Out of 65 documents, 47 papers were published during 2010-2020. We categorized and summarized 19 papers that particularly presented the anti-QS activity of Iranian medicinal plants. Based on our results, different studies have been completed on the QQ effects of medicinal plants. We identified 106 plant species with different properties in medicine that have been evaluated for anti-QS activities in Iran. The QQ effects of herbal extracts were identified through different &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; examinations on biosensor and clinical bacterial strains. Only 35 medicinal plants have shown these effects at sub-MICs. Our review summarizes Iranian medicinal plants with anti-QS properties. Some of these herbal extracts showed anti-QS activity against biosensors, standard and clinical bacterial strains. This result is very important because QS systems can be considered as a new target for the development of new remedial strategies and it is a good opportunity to perform QQ studies to effectively combat bacterial infections in the future.">

Here we investigated the effect of different LED light sources on the essential oil components and antioxidant activity of Melissa officinalis. Two genotypes of lemon balm (Ilam and Isfahan) were subjected to four artificial light treatments, including white, red, blue, red + blue LEDs, and greenhouse light as natural lighting.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The LED lights significantly increased shoot fresh and dry weights and leaf number in the two genotypes as compared to greenhouse condition. The results showed that the content and composition of essential oil in the two genotypes were variable under different light treatments and the total amount of compounds in the Ilam genotype was higher than the other genotype. The results of analysis of the essential oil by GC/MS indicated that the highest amount of monoterpenes in the genotypes was related to citronellal under red + blue LED lamps (15.3 and 17.2% in Ilam and Isfahan genotypes, respectively) but blue, white, and greenhouse condition had the most effect on sesquiterpenes content in both genotypes. The results showed that the observed variation between the two genotypes in the essentials oil composition was related to the relative percentage of the constituents and not to the appearance or lack of a specific component. Red + blue lighting also provided the highest radical scavenging activity in both genotypes (80.77 and 82.09% for Ilam and Isfahan genotypes, respectively). Based on principal component analyses (PCA), three main groups were identified regarding genotypes and all light treatments.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Overall, results indicated that the essentials oil composition of two genotypes of lemon balm was affected both qualitatively and quantitatively by different LED light sources; hence, LED lights might be used to improve monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and antioxidant activity in the selected genotypes.">

Microdilution and agar well diffusion methods were used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) as well as the inhibition zone. The phytconstituents of these products were analyzed using Reverse-phase High- performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-mass). The order of bacteriostatic and bacteriocide rate of the products can be shown as follows: EoAa&gt;AqOc&gt;EtAa = AqAa&gt;EtOc, but the bactericidal effect of &lt;i&gt;A. annua&lt;/i&gt; extracts is higher than of &lt;i&gt;O. corniculata&lt;/i&gt; based on the MIC/MBC ratio and the order is as follows: EoAa&gt;EtAa = AqAa&gt;EtOc&gt;AqOc. The most potent product, i.e. EoAa with a 56.7% inhibition of all isolates, has the potential to substitute 13 used antibiotics including oxacillin, amoxicillin, ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, tetracycline, streptomycin, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, cefazolin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and cefixime (&lt;i&gt;P &lt;0.05&lt;/i&gt;). Different terpenoids were detected and measured in EoAa and catechin flavonoids in extracts of both plants, quercetin in extracts of &lt;i&gt;O. corniculata&lt;/i&gt; but it was only possible to detect chlorogenic acid polyphenol in AqAa. Due to the antibacterial activities of the studied products, more effective than some antibiotics and their edible consumption, these products can be suggested as an alternative to some antibiotics and food preservatives to fight against MDR &lt;i&gt;E. coli.&lt;/i&gt;">

The essential oil (EO) was obtained through steam distillation. The chemical composition of the oil was evaluated by gas chromatography, coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and a flame ionization detector (GC-FID). The analyses led to the identification of 69 compounds in total, of which 40 were found in the leaves and 29 were found in the flowers of the plant. The major components found in the oil were 1,8-Cineole, β-Pinene, δ-3-Carene, α-Pinene, (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-Caryophyllene, Guaiol, and β-Phellandrene. Flower essential oil showed interesting selective inhibitory activity against both enzymes AChE (28.2 ± 1.8 2 µg/mL) and BuChE (28.8 ± 1.5 µg/mL). By contrast, the EO of the leaves showed moderate mean inhibitory activity against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 38.2 ± 2.9 µg/mL and 47.4 ± 2.3 µg/mL, respectively.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Perilla frutescens (L.) Britt is a medicinal and edible plant widely cultivated in Asia. Terpenoids, flavonoids and phenolic acids are the primary source of medicinal ingredients. Glandular trichomes with multicellular structures are known as biochemical cell factories which synthesized specialized metabolites. However, there is currently limited information regarding the site and mechanism of biosynthesis of these constituents in P. frutescens. Herein, we studied morphological features of glandular trichomes, metabolic profiling and transcriptomes through different tissues.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Observation of light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy indicated the presence of three distinct glandular trichome types based on their morphological features: peltate, capitate, and digitiform glandular trichomes. The oil of peltate glandular trichomes, collected by custom-made micropipettes and analyzed by LC-MS and GC-MS, contained perillaketone, isoegomaketone, and egomaketone as the major constituents which are consistent with the components of leaves. Metabolomics and transcriptomics were applied to explore the bioactive constituent biosynthesis in the leaves, stem, and root of P. frutescens. Transcriptome sequencing profiles revealed differential regulation of genes related to terpenoids, flavonoids, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, respectively with most genes expressed highly in leaves. The genes affecting the development of trichomes were preliminarily predicted and discussed.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;The current study established the morphological and chemical characteristics of glandular trichome types of P. frutescens implying the bioactive constituents were mainly synthesized in peltate glandular trichomes. The genes related to bioactive constituents biosynthesis were explored via transcriptomes, which provided the basis for unraveling the biosynthesis of bioactive constituents in this popular medicinal plant.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;The tick Haemaphysalis longicornis (Neumann) is a well-known vector of numerous pathogens of veterinary and medical importance. Various control strategies, including the use of synthetic pesticides, have been developed to control this tick species. However, demand for effective and safe alternative pesticides is increasing due to the adverse effects associated with the intensive and injudicious use of synthetic pesticides, which include undesirable effects on non-target species and environmental pollution. Hence, the acaricidal activity of the extract and the essential oil of Cinnamomum cassia (Chinese cinnamon) and their major components, and the underlying mechanisms of this activity, were evaluated against unfed larvae and nymphs of H. longicornis.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;The components of the extract and essential oil of C. cassia were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and their larvicidal and nymphicidal activity were evaluated using the larval and nymphal packet test. The underlying detoxification mechanism was elucidated by targeting in vivo esterase and monooxygenase activity, and the toxicological effect was assessed on non-target Tenebrio molitor and Harmonia axyridis by topical application in open Petri dishes.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;(E)-cinnamaldehyde was the predominant component of the extract (50.79%) and essential oil (89.95%). The 50% lethal concentration (LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) for larvae and nymphs treated with the extract was 11.56 and 49.18 mg/mL, respectively. The essential oil, (E)-cinnamaldehyde and fenvalerate exhibited acaricidal activity, with LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 3.81, 3.15, and 0.14 mg/mL, respectively, against the larvae, and 21.31, 16.93, and 1.89 mg/mL, respectively, against the nymphs. (E)-cinnamaldehyde significantly increased esterase and monooxygenase activity in both larvae and nymphs. Unlike fenvalerate, C. cassia essential oil and (E)-cinnamaldehyde did not cause mortality of T. molitor or H. axyridis adults.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;This study demonstrates that C. cassia essential oil and (E)-cinnamaldehyde have the potential to be developed into botanical-based larvicidal and nymphicidal agents for tick control.">
