 <p>The 
  <italic>Artemisia</italic> genus includes a large number of species with worldwide distribution and diverse chemical composition. The secondary metabolites of 
  <italic>Artemisia</italic> species have numerous applications in the health, cosmetics, and food sectors. Moreover, many compounds of this genus are known for their antimicrobial, insecticidal, parasiticidal, and phytotoxic properties, which recommend them as possible biological control agents against plant pests. This paper aims to evaluate the latest available information related to the pesticidal properties of 
  <italic>Artemisia</italic> compounds and extracts and their potential use in crop protection. Another aspect discussed in this review is the use of nanotechnology as a valuable trend for obtaining pesticides. Nanoparticles, nanoemulsions, and nanocapsules represent a more efficient method of biopesticide delivery with increased stability and potency, reduced toxicity, and extended duration of action. Given the negative impact of synthetic pesticides on human health and on the environment, 
  <italic>Artemisia</italic>-derived biopesticides and their nanoformulations emerge as promising ecofriendly alternatives to pest management.
