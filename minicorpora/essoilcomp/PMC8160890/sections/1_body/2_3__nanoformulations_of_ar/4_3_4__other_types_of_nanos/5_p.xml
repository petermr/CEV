<p>An example regarding this aspect is the testing of fumigant toxicity of nanocapsules obtained with 
 <italic>A. sieberi</italic> essential oil by in situ polymerization against 
 <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>, compared to the essential oil. Poly(urea-formaldehyde) was used as an external shell and the nanocapsules were spherical, with a diameter of approximately 80 nm. The results demonstrated a higher fumigant toxicity for nanocapsules against 
 <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> after 7 days exposure time, as well as a higher persistence (half life time 28.73 days for nanocapsules and only 4.27 days for the essential oil) [
