<p>In the quest of obtaining prolonged larvicidal activity and of overcoming the disadvantage of high volatility, Osanloo et al. continued the research by encapsulating the essential oil of 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> in chitosan–tripolyphosphate nanocapsules through the ion gelation technique. Briefly, several dilutions of the chitosan solution were added to a mixture containing different proportions of essential oil (0.36–1.6%), Tw 20 (2.5–3%), and ethanol (5.8–7.14%), and then, an aqueous solution of tripolyphosphate (TPP) of different concentrations was added. After determining the particle size and particle size distribution, the formulations with the smallest size (116–384 nm) were chosen to calculate the encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity. The encapsulation efficiency was found to be in the 25.10–39.66% range and the loading capacity was in the 14.88–22.24% range, the highest values being obtained for a nanocapsule size of 168 nm and a 1.6% essential oil, 0.8% chitosan, and 0.04% TPP content. It has been shown that after encapsulation, the essential oil had a sustained release, so the duration of action and the efficiency of larvicidal activity were higher (3–4 days) compared to that of the essential oil (1–2 days), which means that the volatile oil was protected from evaporation [

 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> led to nanocapsules with 203 nm size, an encapsulation efficiency of 34.91%, and a larvicidal activity (against 
 <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic>), which was maintained for 10 days [
