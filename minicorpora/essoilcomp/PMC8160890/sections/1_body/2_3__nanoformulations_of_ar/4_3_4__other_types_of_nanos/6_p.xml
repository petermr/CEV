<p>Another example in establishing the fumigant toxicity is that of nanocapsules prepared using 
 <italic>A. haussknechtii</italic> essential oil by the interfacial compression polymerization method, which were tested against 
 <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> and 
 <italic>Sitophilus oryza</italic>. For the synthesis of nanocapsules, an optimization of the formula (emulsifier and co-emulsifier composition, temperature) was necessary. The results indicated an aggregation of nanocapsules when Tw 20 and Tw 40 were used as emulsifiers and poly vinyl pyrrolidone was used as co-emulsifier; meanwhile, using Tw 80 as emulsifier, at 45 °C for both micelle preparation and polymerization led to a good stability of nanocapsules with granular and spherical shape and a 40–50 nm size. The insecticidal activity varied depending on the species. Comparing the LC
 <sub>50</sub> values for the fumigant toxicity of nanocapsules and of a reference product, a decrease of the concentration is observed in the case of nanocapsules. Stability testing has shown in the case of nanocapsules a constant release that was maintained for several days (up to 45 days) even if the mortality rate reached 50%. In contrast, the stability of the essential oil was comparatively lower [
