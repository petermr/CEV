<p>Based on the essential oil of 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> containing as major compounds p-allylanisole, cis- and beta-ocimene, limonene, and 3-methoxycinnamaldehyde, Osanloo et al. prepared, characterized, and tested 12 types of nanoemulsions with the same amount of essential oil (3.6 μL/mL). A final tested concentration of 18 ppm was obtained each time, but the concentration of tween 20 (Tw 20) with/without isopropyl alcohol (IPA) varied. After optimizing the synthesis by measuring median particle size, particle size distribution, and stability in undiluted and 1:200 diluted forms, two formulations were chosen for larvicidal studies against 3rd and 4th instar larvae of 
 <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic>. The first formula contained minimal amounts of surfactant/co-surfactant (2.5% Tw 20 and 2.5% IPA) with a median particle size of 15.6 nm, and the second formula contained only 10% Tw 20 (without IPA). After dilution, the second formula presented the smallest variation for median particle size (14.5 nm before, 11.20 nm after) and particle size distribution (1.30 nm before, 2.1 nm after). It is important to test formulations after dilution, given the fact that World Health Organization guidelines stipulate 1:100 or 1:200 dilution ratios for testing mosquito larvicides. The larvicidal effect of the two formulations was compared to that of the essential oil. Given the fact that the first formulation showed changes in the nanostructure after dilution, the recorded larvicidal effect was similar to that of the essential oil. However, for the second formula, the larvicidal effect was significantly higher. This can be explained by the stable formulation of the nanoemulsion after dilution and by the small size, which improves the ability of passing through the pores into the larva’s body [
