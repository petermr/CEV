<p>Another environmentally friendly technique of formulating pesticides based on essential oils together with preventing their rapid evaporation is to incorporate them into solid lipid nanoparticles [

 <italic>A. arborescens</italic> essential oil into solid lipid nanoparticles using Compritol 888 ATO as lipid and Poloxamer 188 or Miranol Ultra C32 as surfactants through the hot high-pressure homogenization technique. The obtained formulations demonstrated a good physical stability when stored for 2 months at different temperatures, and the in vitro testing showed a good capacity of reducing essential oil evaporation [
