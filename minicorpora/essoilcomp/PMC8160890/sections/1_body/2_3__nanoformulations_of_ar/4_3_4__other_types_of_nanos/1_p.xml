<p>A novel alternative approach used for larvicidal activity, besides MeNPs, is represented by nanoemulsions, which in this case can be obtained using essential oil from 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> spp., knowing that the essential oil components have larvicidal activity. It has been demonstrated that the essential oil isolated from 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> has larvicidal and repellent action against 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> through its major components (α-humulene, β-caryophyllene, and caryophyllene oxide) [
