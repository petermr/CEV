<p>Inorganic NPs such as ZnO, SiO
 <sub>2</sub>, TiO
 <sub>2</sub>, and AgNPs were studied for their plant protection potential [
 <xref rid="B168-molecules-26-03061" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>]. For example, ZnONPs have been shown to provide effective growth control of fungi such as 
 <italic>Alternaria alternate, Aspergillus flavus, Fusarium graminearum</italic>, 
 <italic>F. oxysporum, Penicillium expansum,</italic> and 
 <italic>Rhizopus stolonifer</italic> as well as of the
