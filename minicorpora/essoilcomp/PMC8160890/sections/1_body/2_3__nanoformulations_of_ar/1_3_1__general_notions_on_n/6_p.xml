<p>A nanoformulation made of chitosan/tripolyphosphate NPs was also used to encapsulate paraquat, and the system proved to be less toxic than the pure compound, which was efficient after encapsulation and showing good protection of other plant species [

This system has shown an 88% degradation of the herbicide atrazine under controlled environment. Most NPs systems focus on the degradation of herbicides under different natural conditions [

Nanoherbicides prevent the regrowth of weeds in an eco-friendly manner. Different species of weeds exposed to SiO
