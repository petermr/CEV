<p>More than 90% of pesticides are either lost and accumulating in the environment or unable to reach target sites for the best pest control. Nanotechnology tries to design formulations with slow release of such substances. The main toxic effects of pesticides depend on the solubility, stability, decomposition under sunlight, and soil absorption [

Therefore, it is important to extend the study of such nanocompounds that can provide valuable nutrients and protection against pests (insects, bacteria, harmful plants) but can also induce stress in other species of the ecosystem or have negative effects on the antioxidant molecules profile of certain crops [
