<p>Nanotechnology can be used to obtain nanoparticles, nanocapsules, nanoemulsions, nanogels, nanospheres, metal, and metal oxide nanoparticles that control or delay the delivery of active substances, adjust their absorption, and can prove to be more effective and environmentally safe and friendly. Nanoparticles (NPs) have specific sizes, a large surface area, different morphology, and high reactivity, which provide them with improved mechanical, electrical, optical, chemical, and magnetic properties, as well as with a different in vivo behavior. The production of nanocrystals is likely to increase the efficiency of pesticides at lower doses, followed by a decrease in soil and water pollution [
