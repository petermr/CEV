<p>Herbicides and insecticides are toxic substances with a long-term impact on the environment. Through nanoformulations, scientists intend to reduce their negative impacts and extend their life through controlled release, to provide a greater selectivity protecting other plant species, insects, and microorganisms, as well as to ensure their chemical protection to environmental factors such as degradation under UV radiation [

Such controlled release is expected to work on competing weeds. For example, a nanoparticle system delivers a targeted herbicide molecule to a specific receptor in the roots of certain weeds, which enters through the roots and inhibits the glycolysis of nutrient reserves; the weed plant will no longer have access to food and will eventually die. The process is controlled by soil moisture and rainfall [
