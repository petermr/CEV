<p>Another class of such systems is represented by plant elicitors that are stress-inducing agents. They can be classified as biotic (fungal homogenates, insects, and microorganisms) and abiotic (temperature, light, salinity, wounds, metal ions) elicitors. It has been shown that several NPs can also act as elicitors, forcing the plant to defend itself by producing certain metabolites. A system based on cobalt NPs has shown a potential application for increasing artemisinin content in suspension cultures [
