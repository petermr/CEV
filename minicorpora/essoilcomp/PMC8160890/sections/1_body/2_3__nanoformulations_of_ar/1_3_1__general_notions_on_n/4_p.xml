<p>Nanotechnology presents various applications in agriculture through the production of nanofertilizers, nanoherbicides, nanofungicides, and nanosensors. Nanofertilizers ensure good development of the crop by promoting good absorption of micronutrients suitable for plant growing; they can be made of silica, titanium dioxide, zinc [

Nanopesticides offer protection against biotic-type stresses; their main application is represented by encapsulation forms for the controlled release of pesticides, with improved selectivity and stability. Such compounds will cost less and have a longer duration of action [
