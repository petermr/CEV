<p>Different pesticide release systems were studied, and photocatalytic materials may find applications in the degradation of pesticides that are highly harmful for the environment [

 <sub>2</sub>NPs was registered for many pesticides (e.g., chlorothalonil, chlorpyrifos, and cypermethrin) under UVA irradiation [
