<p>Various conditions for the synthesis of ZnONPs nanoparticles using 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> spp. have been identified. One can start from a classic aqueous extract obtained by heating and stirring at 80 째C for 20 min and at 46 째C for 24 h, as in the case of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> stem barks [
 <xref rid="B187-molecules-26-03061" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>] or by distillation at 110 째C of a jelly paste obtained from plant leaves and stems ground with distilled water, as in the case of 
 <italic>A. pallens</italic> [
 <xref rid="B211-molecules-26-03061" ref-type="bibr">211</xref>]. Moreover, a methanolic extract obtained by shaking incubation at 25 째C for 48 h was also used in the case of 
 <italic>A. aucheri</italic> aerial parts [
