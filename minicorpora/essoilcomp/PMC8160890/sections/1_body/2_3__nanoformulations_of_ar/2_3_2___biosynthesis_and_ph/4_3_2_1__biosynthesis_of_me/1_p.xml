<p>The synthesis of MeNPs using plants mainly involves collecting the plant, selecting an environmentally friendly solvent, obtaining the extract, and applying suitable reaction conditions for NPs synthesis, separating and finally purifying the formed NPs. The available literature provides several examples of MeNPs obtained using 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> spp. extracts, such as AgNPs, AuNPs, ZnONPs, CuNPs, and TiO
 <sub>2</sub>NPs. Therefore, some examples of conditions that can be used for the synthesis of AgNPs and AuNPs from different 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> species, such as 
 <italic>A. absinthium, A. abrotanum, A. afra, A. annua</italic>, 
 <italic>A. arborescens, A. capillaris, A. haussknechtii, A. marschalliana, A. nilagirica, A. tournefortiana, A. tschernieviana,</italic> and 
 <italic>A. vulgaris,</italic> are presented in
