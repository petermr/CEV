<p>In the case of AuNPs, the reaction conditions influence the quantity, shape, and size of the obtained nanoparticles. An example is that of AuNPs synthesized using 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic>. The extract was obtained by a microwave digestion system at 80 °C for 220 s, which was followed by cooling down for 400 s. The synthesis of AuNPs was performed in a reactor by continuously heating and stirring at 80 °C. The studied conditions were represented by an extract concentration of 1–5% (

 <italic>v</italic>), a 0.05–5 mM gold salt concentration in a pH range of 2.8–5, and a reaction time of up to 60 minutes. It was proved that 1–2% extract concentrations were ineffective, while for concentrations between 3 and 5%, the characteristic SPR peak is displaced from 850 to 700 nm (which reflects an increase in nanoprism edge length) with the increase of extract concentration and decrease in the size of triangular nanoparticles. The 0.05 mM and 0.275 mM concentrations of chloroauric acid (HAuCl
 <sub>4</sub>) proved to be suitable for obtaining spherical nanoparticles, while at higher concentrations, the shape varied between spherical, hexagonal, and triangular. For concentrations higher than 1 mM HAuCl
 <sub>4</sub>, the size of all nanoparticles increased. At a pH lower than 4, the formed NPs are mostly triangles, while at a pH higher than 5, no triangular AuNPs were formed [
