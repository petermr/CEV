<p>The synthesis of AgNPs using an 
 <italic>A. afra</italic> extract is a good example for highlighting the influence of the reaction time. In this case, it was observed that with the increase of the reaction time, the intensity of the absorption peak corresponding to SPR increased, thus demonstrating a rise in the synthesis rate. The AgNPs synthesis was complete after 30 min, as demonstrated by the overlapping peaks of the UV-Vis spectrum at 45 and 60 min. A continuation of the reaction after 60 min demonstrated a shift of the peak to shorter wavelengths, which could be explained by a slight reduction in the AgNPs size [
