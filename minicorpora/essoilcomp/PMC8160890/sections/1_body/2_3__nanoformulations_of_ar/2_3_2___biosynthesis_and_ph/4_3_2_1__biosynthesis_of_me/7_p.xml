<p>The pH is a crucial factor for the synthesis of AgNPs, its variation leading to the modification of charged biomolecules, thus influencing their ability to reduce Ag ions [

 <italic>A. annua</italic>, the pH was investigated in the 3.0â€“9.0 range. The results showed that at pH 3.0 and 5.0, there is no reduction of Ag ions, while at neutral (7.0) and alkaline pH (9.0), respectively, small AgNPs are obtained [
