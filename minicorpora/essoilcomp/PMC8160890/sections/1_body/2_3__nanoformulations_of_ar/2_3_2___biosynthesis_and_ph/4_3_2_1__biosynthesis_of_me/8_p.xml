<p>In order to analyze the influence of temperature on nucleation and AgNPs size, Anush et al. compared the UV-Vis spectra of the reaction mixture at room temperature, at 40 °C and at 60 °C, respectively. The intensity of absorption peaks showed that AgNPs synthesis is achieved in a shorter time at higher temperatures, and the obtained peak is sharper, while at room temperature, the synthesis proceeds more slowly, and the absorption peak is broader [
