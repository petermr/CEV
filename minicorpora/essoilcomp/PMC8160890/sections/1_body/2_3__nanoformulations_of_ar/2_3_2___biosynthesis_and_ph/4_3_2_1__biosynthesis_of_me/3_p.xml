 <xref rid="B196-molecules-26-03061" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>]. However, it is recommended that high temperatures are avoided during heating, in order to prevent possible degradation of biomolecules that participate in the reduction process [
 <xref rid="B197-molecules-26-03061" ref-type="bibr">197</xref>]. Most often, the mixture is further decanted or filtered through Whatman filter paper and stored in a cold place until further use.
