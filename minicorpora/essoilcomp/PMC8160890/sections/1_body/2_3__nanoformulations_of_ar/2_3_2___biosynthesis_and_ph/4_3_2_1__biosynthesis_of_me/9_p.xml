<p>Other factors that must be taken into account are the extract and silver salt concentrations. During the synthesis of AgNPs using 
 <italic>A. annua</italic>, silver nitrate (AgNO
 <sub>3</sub>) solutions in the 0.5–4 mM range and 2.5–15 g% extract concentrations were tested. The maximum amount of AgNPs was obtained at a concentration of 2 mM AgNO
 <sub>3</sub>. Regarding the influence of the extract concentration, the synthesis of AgNPs increased until a 5 g% concentration, followed eventually by a decrease [
