<p>Regarding the synthesis of NPs, two main approaches can be used: the top–down approach and the bottom–up approach, the main difference between them being the starting material [

 <xref rid="B177-molecules-26-03061" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>]. Through the top–down approach, NPs are formed by reducing a bulk material into small units through chemical or physical methods, such as thermal milling, laser ablation [
