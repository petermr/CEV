<p>The AgNPs synthesis and stability are usually monitored by recording the UV-Vis spectrum during the reaction, detecting the characteristic SPR peak in the 400â€“450 nm range: 410 nm [
 <xref rid="B199-molecules-26-03061" ref-type="bibr">199</xref>], 420 nm [
 <xref rid="B189-molecules-26-03061" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>,
 <xref rid="B194-molecules-26-03061" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>], 430 nm [

 <xref rid="B203-molecules-26-03061" ref-type="bibr">203</xref>], or 450 nm [
 <xref rid="B186-molecules-26-03061" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>]. For other types of MeNPs, the appearance of the SPR band at more than 500 nm demonstrates the synthesis of AuNPs [

 <xref rid="B206-molecules-26-03061" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>] with an increase of the absorbance intensity in time [
 <xref rid="B191-molecules-26-03061" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>]. In other cases, the broad absorption peak at 330 nm demonstrates the monodisperse nature of the formed ZnONPs [
 <xref rid="B187-molecules-26-03061" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>], and the broad peak found between 200 and 300 nm in the case of CuNPs reflects a wide size distribution, while the intrinsic band gap absorption at a wavelength smaller than 400 nm is attributed to TiO
