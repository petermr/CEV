<p>The presence of the same bands in the FTIR spectra can demonstrate that the respective biomolecules are present on the surface of NPs, while the shifts to smaller or larger wavenumbers demonstrate the interaction of the components with Ag atoms [

 <sup>−1</sup>, which was probably due to a new alkane C-H stretching vibration [

 <sup>−1</sup> attributed to a stretching vibration of the N = O bond found in the nitro group, which is formed by the oxidation of the amino group and the reduction of Ag ions [
