<p>The comparative FTIR analysis of the spectra of extracts and AuNPs reveals the same functional groups (O-H, C = O, and C-O) [

 <xref rid="B210-molecules-26-03061" ref-type="bibr">210</xref>], that were attributed to some phenolic acids and flavonoids present in 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> extracts (chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, tannic acid, salicylic acid, ascorbic acid, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, ethyl p-anisate, niacin), but also N-H bonds [
 <xref rid="B210-molecules-26-03061" ref-type="bibr">210</xref>]. Therefore, such compounds are responsible for the reduction process and can be adsorbed/complexed on the surface of AuNPs [
