<p>Consequently, antioxidant metabolites and plant enzymes that have the role of preventing oxidation and cell damage can act as reducing agents and thus be used as scaffolds to direct the MeNPs synthesis. Among these metabolites, flavonoids have an important reducing potential on metal ions mainly through their ability to donate electrons or hydrogen atoms and change the keto group to enol [

For phenolic acids, the reducing capacity depends on their structure and can be attributed to nucleophilic aromatic rings, a phenolic hydroxyl group, which as a result of interaction with metal ions undergoes an oxidation process in the case of gallic acid or electron delocalization between the aromatic ring and the propanoic chain for caffeic acid. Proteins can also participate in the synthesis of MeNPs through carbonyl, hydroxyl, and/or amino groups [
