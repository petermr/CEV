<p>X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a technique that can be used for structural analysis of MeNPs. Generally, for AgNPs, in the 10°–80° 2
 <italic>θ</italic> range, four diffraction peaks are observed around 38°, 44°, 64°, and 77°, which correspond to the (111), (200), (220), and (311) planes of the face-centered cubic silver crystal, demonstrating the nanocrystalline nature of AgNPs [

 <italic>A. annua</italic>, Khatoon et al. recorded a 5th diffraction peak around 81°, which was indexed to (222) orientation. The XRD analysis of the AuNPs revealed approximately the same values for diffraction peaks as in the case of AgNPs that correspond to (111), (200), (220), and (311) planes, confirming the crystalline nature of AuNPs. The XRD pattern of ZnONPs showed seven different peaks, with a 4–9 nm crystallite size, which demonstrates the material’s nanostructure [

For CuNPs, the XRD analysis highlighted 11 diffraction peaks around 33°, 36°, 39°, 48°, 54°, 58°, 63°, 67°, 69°, 74°, and 77°, corresponding to (110), (002), (111), (202), (020), (202), (113), (311), (113), (311), and (004) planes, while for TiO
 <sub>2</sub>NPs, there are 12 diffraction peaks around 25°, 37°, 48°, 54°, 56°, 58°, 63°, 69°, 70°, 75°, 77°, and 84°, corresponding to (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), (204), (116), (220), (215), and (303) planes, demonstrating the crystal structure of MeNPs [
