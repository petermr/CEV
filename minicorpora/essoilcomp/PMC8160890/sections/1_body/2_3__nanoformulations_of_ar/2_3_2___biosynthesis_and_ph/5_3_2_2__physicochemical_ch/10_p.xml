<p>Another aspect confirmed by FTIR analysis is that biomolecules from plant extracts can form a layer covering the MeNPs [
 <xref rid="B197-molecules-26-03061" ref-type="bibr">197</xref>], which prevents the agglomeration of nanoparticles and hence contributes to their stability in the environment. Therefore, biomolecules present in extracts act as both reducing and stabilizing agents for the synthesized MeNPs [
