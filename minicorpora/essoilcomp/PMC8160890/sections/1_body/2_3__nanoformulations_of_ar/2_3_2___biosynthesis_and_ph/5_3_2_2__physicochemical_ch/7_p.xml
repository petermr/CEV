<p>Therefore, biomolecules containing carbonyl and hydroxyl groups as well as carboxyl and amide bonds have a greater capacity to participate as reducing agents in the MeNPs synthesis [

The explanation given by Elemike et al. would be that metal ions can form an intermediate complex with free radicals present in biomolecules, which subsequently undergo an oxidation process to keto forms with the consequent reduction of metal ions to MeNPs [
