<p>Due to the contained phytochemicals, 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> spp. could also be used for the mosquito larvicidal activity. There are several studies investigating the effectiveness of MeNPs against different developmental stages of 
 <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, with the possibility of malaria and dengue fever prevention. Nalini et al. conducted research on the activity of AgNPs synthesized from 
 <italic>A. nilagirica</italic> on larvae and pupae of the two vector species compared to that of the aqueous extract. The results showed that AgNPs have better larvicidal and pupicidal properties compared to the extract. For both species, the higher rate of susceptibility was observed in pupa with a linear increase from the 4th to 1st stage (except for the extract against 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, where the 2nd stage required a higher dose than the 1st stage in order to cause lethal effect). Another research study tested the insecticidal action of AgNPs obtained using an 
 <italic>A. herba-alba</italic> extract on 
 <italic>Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti</italic>, but also against 
 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> [
