<p>The exact mechanism of the AgNPs larvicidal effect is still unknown and is currently being researched. Larval mortality may appear either because of penetration of AgNPs through treated larval membranes and interaction with cell membranes, because of cell death resulting from the inactivation of enzymes and peroxide generation when AgNPs reach the midgut epithelial membrane, or because of the interaction of AgNPs with sulfur and phosphorus found in cell membranes [
