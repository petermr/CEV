<p>Another example is that of AgNPs synthesized from 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic>, which have been tested against some oomycetes of the 
 <italic>Phytophthora</italic> genus 
 <italic>(P. capsici, P. cinnamomi, P. infestans, P. katsurae, P. palmivora, P. parasitica,</italic> and 
 <italic>P. tropicalis</italic>), which are responsible for many crop diseases and are known for developing resistance to fungicides. The studied AgNPs have been shown to have high potency and efficiency on mycelial growth, spore germination, germ tube elongation, zoospore production, and spore encystment, especially for 
 <italic>P. parasitica</italic> and 
 <italic>P. capsici.</italic> Furthermore, in the case of treating tobacco plants with AgNPs it was observed that not only did they prevent infection and improve plant survival, but they also had no adverse effects on plant growth or anatomy [
