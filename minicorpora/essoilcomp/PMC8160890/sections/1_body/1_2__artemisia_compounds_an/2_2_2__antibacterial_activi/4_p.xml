<p>In the previously mentioned study, some constituents isolated from the essential oils were evaluated individually for their antibacterial activity. Caryophyllene oxide, camphor, borneol, and 1,8-cineole did not show activity against the phytopathogenic bacteria. Terpinen-4-ol inhibited the growth of all tested bacteria with MIC values ranging from 60 to 110 μL/mL and linalool blocked the development of 22 bacterial strains with MIC values in the 50–110 μL/mL domain. α-Terpineol was active (MIC = 60–70 μL/mL) only on
