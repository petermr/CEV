<p>Only a small number of studies investigated the effect of 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> spp. extracts on phytopathogenic bacteria. For instance, different 
 <italic>A. nilagirica</italic> leaves extracts were tested in vitro against four phytopathogenic bacteria, 
 <italic>Erwinia</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Clavibacter michiganense</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas syringae,</italic> and 
 <italic>Xanthomonas campestris</italic>, which cause diseases in potato, tomato, leafy greens, carrot, onion, and green pepper. The hexane extract was the most efficient in inhibiting all tested bacteria with MIC of 32 Âµg/mL. The ethanol, methanol, diethyl ether, and chloroform extracts were moderately active against the four bacteria, while the petroleum ether extract was the least effective [

 <italic>Artemisia parviflora</italic> (1:6

 <italic>v</italic>) were almost ineffective against 
 <italic>Xanthomonas vesicatoria</italic> and 
 <italic>Ralstonia solanacearum</italic>, with inhibition zones of 1 and 2 mm [
