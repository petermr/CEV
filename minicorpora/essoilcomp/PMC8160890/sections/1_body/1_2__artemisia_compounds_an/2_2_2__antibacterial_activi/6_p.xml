<p>Terpenes and phenolic compounds found in the essential oils are responsible for the intense antimicrobial activity. Terpenes have the ability to increase membrane permeability by infiltrating the phospholipidic bilayer; the damage to the bacterial membrane causes the loss of cytoplasmic components, which leads to cell death. Plant extracts are studied not only as inhibitors of bacterial growth, but also for the prevention of biofilm formation. Such is the case of

 <italic>A. campestris</italic> essential oils that can reduce biofilm formation by up to 70% [
