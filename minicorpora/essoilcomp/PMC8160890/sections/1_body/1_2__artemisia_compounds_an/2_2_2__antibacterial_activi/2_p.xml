<p>The essential oil of 
 <italic>Artemisia turanica</italic> exhibited inhibitory activity at 2% (

 <italic>v</italic>) concentration against tumor galls induced by 
 <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> on potato discs, but it did not demonstrate antibacterial activity in vitro against 
 <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> at the same dose [

 <italic>Artemisia fragrans</italic> inhibited tumor growth in different percentages at 10, 100, and 1000 ppm. Leaves and flowers extract had the highest inhibition at all concentration (20, 38, 46%) compared to root extract (15, 24, 34%). No extract had any significant effect on the viability of 
 <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> when tested by agar diffusion assay [
