<p>The same

 <italic>Eisenia fetida</italic>, and the plant 
 <italic>Allium cepa</italic>. The hydrolate was toxic in low concentrations: it caused substantial inhibition of onion root growth (LC

Probably, 2,6-dimethylocta-5,7-diene-2,3-diol is able to penetrate biological membranes and thus affect the survival and metabolic processes of soil organism from different trophic levels [
