<p>Choosing the right formulation can reduce toxicity as well as increase the stability and effectiveness of 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> biopesticides. For instance, terpenoids are lipophilic, volatile, and thermolabile compounds that are easily oxidized or hydrolyzed, so they can be affected during extraction, storage, and transport. Furthermore, after application onto plants, they volatilized quickly and start degrading, leading to short persistence and low efficacy in the field. These drawbacks can be overcome by a suitable formulation through encapsulation or nanoparticles synthesis. A product formulation is a homogeneous and stable mixture of components put together according to a specific procedure with the purpose of increasing the biological activity, stability, persistence, and efficiency, while decreasing the toxicity of the product. The selected formulation depends on the intended use and mode of application, the targeted phytopathogen, and the degradation factors present in the ecosystem [
