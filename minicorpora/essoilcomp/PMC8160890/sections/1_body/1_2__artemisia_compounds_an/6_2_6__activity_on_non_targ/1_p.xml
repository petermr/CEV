<p>Since biopesticides and bioherbicides are of natural origin, they are considered to be less harmful to the environment and the health of applicators and consumers. Usually, plant-based formulations are mixtures of compounds, and they do not consist of a single substance, which should prevent resistance in target organisms. In addition, some phytochemicals are rapidly degraded in nature, so there is no risk of their accumulation in the environment, as is the case with chemical pesticides. Consequently, plant-based pesticides and herbicides are regarded as generally safe. Still, these products can affect the non-target organism directly or indirectly by influencing biodiversity and species interactions, so it is imperative to assess their safety [
