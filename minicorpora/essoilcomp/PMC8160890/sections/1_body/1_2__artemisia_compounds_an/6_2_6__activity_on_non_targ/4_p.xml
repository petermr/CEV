<p>The methanol extracts of 
 <italic>Artemisia fragrans</italic> manifested significant toxicity in the brine shrimp (Artemia salina) lethality assay, with ED
 <sub>50</sub> = 19.7 ppm for the root extract and ED
 <sub>50</sub> = 11.99 ppm for flowers and leaves extract [

 <italic>Artemisia ordosica</italic> leaves were tested on two algae from the biological soil crusts, 
 <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> and 
 <italic>Nostoc</italic> spp. The less concentrated extract (1 g/L) stimulated 
 <italic>C. vulgaris</italic> growth but did not significantly affect 
 <italic>Nostoc</italic> spp., indicating that 
 <italic>C. vulgaris</italic> might utilize the sugars and other carbon sources in the extract to promote self-growth. The highly concentrated extract (5 and 10 g/L) inhibited the growth of both algae [
