 <italic>Artemisia absinthium</italic> essential oil, a potential biopesticide, was evaluated for toxicity against non-target organisms: the honey bee (
 <italic>Apis mellifera</italic>) and tomato plant (
 <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>). Honeybee toxicity (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.26 mg/cm
 <sup>2</sup>) is reached at lower concentrations of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> oil than the ones necessary for controlling the leaf miner 
 <italic>Tuta absoluta</italic> (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.5 mg/cm
 <sup>2</sup>), but not at rates needed to control the whitefly 
 <italic>Trialeurodes vaporariorum</italic> (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.08 mg/cm
 <sup>2</sup>). A similar phenomenon was noted for the phytotoxic effect on tomato; seed germination and root growth were inhibited at oil concentrations needed to control the leaf miner, but not the whitefly [
