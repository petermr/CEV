<p>The safety profile of the 
 <italic>Artemisia nilagirica</italic> essential oil was determined in terms of mammalian toxicity on male mice (
 <italic>Mus musculus</italic>) and millet (
 <italic>Eleusine coracana</italic>) seeds viability. The essential oil showed low toxicity on mice (LD
 <sub>50</sub> = 7528.10 ÂµL/kg) and no effect on millet seed germination. Thus, the oil is suitable as a food preservative for both consumption and sowing purposes [
