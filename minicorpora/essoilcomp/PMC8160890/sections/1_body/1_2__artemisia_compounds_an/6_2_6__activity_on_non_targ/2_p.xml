<p>Little information is available regarding the ecotoxicity of 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> compounds and extracts. Pino-Otin et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-03061" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] evaluated the toxicity of hydrolate and organic extracts from 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> on three aquatic ecotoxicity indicator organisms: an invertebrate (
 <italic>Daphnia magna</italic>), a marine bacterium (
 <italic>Vibrio fisheri</italic>), and a unicellular freshwater alga (
 <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>). The wormwood hydrolate, a by-product of essential oil extraction, is a promising biopesticide with nematicidal effect due to (5
 <italic>Z</italic>)-2,6-dimethylocta-5,7-dien-2,3-diol [

 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> hydrolate caused acute toxicity on non-target organisms: 
 <italic>D. magna</italic> (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.236%) &gt; 
 <italic>V. fisheri</italic> (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.85%) &gt; 
 <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 16.49%). Moreover, the wormwood ethanol extract was highly toxic to 
 <italic>D. magna</italic> (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.093 mg/L). However, the effect of wormwood hydrolate on a river microbial community, composed mainly of Proteobacteria, was negligible, causing only small changes in metabolic diversity and a slight inhibition of bacterial growth. It is possible that natural freshwater microbial populations are more resistant to 2,6-dimethylocta-5,7-diene-2,3-diol action because of the modified bioavailability of compounds in the river water and particular sensitivity of the various microbial species [
