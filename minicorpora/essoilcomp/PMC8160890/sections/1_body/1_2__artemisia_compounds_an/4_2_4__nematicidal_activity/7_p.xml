<p>Various hypotheses have been advanced as explanations for the nematicidal effects of essential oils: disruption of cell membrane permeability and obstruction of its functions, irreversible modifications of proteins structures from the nematode surface induced by aldehydes, inhibition of acetylcholinesterase with build-up of neurotransmitter in the central nervous system of the nematode followed by convulsion, paralysis, and death [
