 <italic>Artemisia herba-alba</italic> essential oil produced 94.4% mortality on 
 <italic>Meloidogyne incognita</italic> second-stage juveniles at 15 µg/mL and 100% mortality on 
 <italic>Xiphinema index</italic> females at 2 µg/mL, after 24 h exposure. However, mixed-age infective specimens of 
 <italic>Pratylenchus vulnus</italic> were more resistant to the activity of 
 <italic>A. herba-alba</italic> essential oil with mortality values ranging from 56.8% to 67% after 24 to 96 h of exposure. The major components of the essential oil were cis- and trans-thujone, camphor, 1,8-cineole, trans-chrysantenyl acetate, and camphene. In an additional test, the three nematode species were exposed to various compounds of the essential oils of four plants, including 
 <italic>A. herba-alba</italic>. Borneol and α-pinene manifested poor to moderate activity, while limonene lack activity on the three nematode species. Camphor exhibited a moderate nematicidal effect, whilst thymol and thujone (mixture of cis-thujone, 70% and trans-thuione) displayed strong activity against 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic>, and less so on 
 <italic>P. vulnus</italic> and 
 <italic>X. index</italic>. The fact that the activity of the components of the volatile oil is weaker than that of the whole oil suggests a possible synergistic action of the mixture. In addition, soil treatments with 100 or 200 µg/kg 
 <italic>A. herba-alba</italic> essential oil, by fumigation or application of water solution, significantly inhibited nematode density on tomato roots and in soil and also increased the plant biomass. Fumigation was proven to be more effective than drenching treatment [
