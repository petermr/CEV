<p>The nematicidal activity of 
 <italic>Artemisia absinthium</italic> hydrolate, a by-product of essential oil extraction, was evaluated on the root-knot nematode, 
 <italic>Meloidogyne javanica</italic>. The hydrolate caused high mortality of second-stage juvenile and suppression of egg hatching, proving the ability of the 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> hydrolate to penetrate the gelatinous matrix of eggs. In vivo tests showed a strong inhibition of juvenilesâ€™ penetration in the tomato roots. Soil treatment with 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> hydrolate (60% and 20% concentrations) significantly reduced the reproductive capacity of root-knot nematode and the infection frequency. The main component of the hydrolate, responsible for the nematicidal activity, was identified as (5Z)-2,6-dimethylocta-5,7-dien-2,3-diol [
