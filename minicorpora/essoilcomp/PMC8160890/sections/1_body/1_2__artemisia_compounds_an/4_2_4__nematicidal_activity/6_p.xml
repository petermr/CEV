<p>Kalaiselvi et al. [
 <xref rid="B98-molecules-26-03061" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>] showed that essential oils of 
 <italic>A. nilagirica</italic> plants collected from high and low altitude have different composition and different nematicidal activity against 
 <italic>Meloidogyne incognita</italic> (LC
 <sub>50/48h</sub> of 5.75 and 10.23 μg/mL, respectively). α-thujone, α-myrcene, and linalyl isovalerate were the main components of high-altitude 
 <italic>A.</italic>
 <italic>nilagirica</italic> volatile oil, while the low-altitude plants produced an oil composed mostly of camphor, caryophyllene oxide, eucalyptol, humulene epoxide II, α-humulene, and β-caryophyllene. Experiments carried out in vivo by soil irrigation with the essential oil revealed that both volatile oils significantly reduced the infection of tomato plant (number of nematode juveniles and eggs) and enhanced plant growth (fresh weight of aerial parts and roots) at 20 µg/mL. Again, the effect was greater for the oil originated from high-altitude 
 <italic>A. nilagirica</italic>. Moreover, the ethanol extract of flowering parts of 
 <italic>A. nilagirica</italic> (1 mg/mL) exhibited nematicidal activity against 
 <italic>Meloidogyne incognita</italic>, as reported by an earlier study [
