 <italic>Meloidogyne javanica</italic> juveniles in an in vitro test. Furthermore, in vivo experiments were conducted in order to assess the ability of the essential oil to inhibit root-knot nematode development after being absorbed by the tomato plants. It was observed that spraying the oil on tomato leaves actually increased the number of galls and eggs in treated plants, and applying the essential oil into the soil at 0.25% and 0.5% concentrations did not lower the number of galls or nematode eggs in tomato plants. The authors believe that the nematicidal compounds could have been volatilized or degraded by microorganisms in the soil or by the plant, or possibly, the root exudates were modified by the absorbed essential oil, making the tomato plants more appealing to the nematodes [
