<p>Various 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> species were evaluated for nematicidal activity, some with promising results. For instance, 
 <italic>A. judaica</italic> essential oil (1 Î¼L/L) caused 85% mortality on 
 <italic>Meloidogyne javanica</italic> second-stage juveniles and inhibited the hatching of eggs. The main component of the essential oil was artemisia ketone. In the same study, 
 <italic>A. arborescens</italic> and 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> essential oils were poorly active on the root-knot nematode [

 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> essential oil was evaluated against second-stage juveniles of 
 <italic>Meloidogyne incognita</italic> and pre-adults of 
 <italic>Rotylenchulus reniformis</italic> (reniform nematode). Concentrations of 500 and 250 ppm induced 100% mortality in both nematode species [
 <xref rid="B93-molecules-26-03061" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Moreover, there are reports of nematicidal activity exhibited by the alcoholic and aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> against 
 <italic>Meloidogyne incognita</italic> and 
 <italic>Pratylenchus loosi</italic> (tea root lesion nematode) [
 <xref rid="B91-molecules-26-03061" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>].
