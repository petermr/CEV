<p>In addition to the essential oils and their volatile compounds, few other substances from 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> genus have been tested for their activity against plant nematodes. Thirteen chemical compounds (apigenin, bonanzin, nepetin, dihydroluteolin, scopoletin, isoscopoletin, benzoic acid, β-sitosterol, γ-sitosterol, betulinic acid, friedelin, linoleic acid, and a long chain ketone) isolated from 
 <italic>Artemisia elegantissima</italic> and 
 <italic>Artemisia incisa</italic> were tested in vitro and in vivo for nematicidal activity against 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic>. All phytochemicals significantly inhibited egg hatching and induced high mortality of second-stage juveniles at the tested concentrations (0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 mg/mL). Isoscopoletin was even more effective than the positive control carbofuran. In addition, application of the compounds as a root drench (0.1 mg/mL) on potted tomato plants caused a marked reduction of galls, galling index, and egg masses on plant roots, numbers of juveniles in the rhizosphere soil, and also improved tomato plant growth parameters (shoot and root length and weight). Isoscopoletin and apigenin were the most active compounds [
