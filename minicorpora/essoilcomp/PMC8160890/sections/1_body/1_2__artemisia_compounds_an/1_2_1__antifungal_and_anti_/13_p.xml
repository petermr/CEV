<p>The phytocompounds mechanism of action against fungi involves the inhibition of enzymes that control energy or structural compounds production, degeneration of fungal cell wall with loss of cytoplasm, and plasma membrane dysfunction. Due to their lipophilic nature, components of essential oils can penetrate cell walls, increase cellular membranes permeability and disturb the fungal cells metabolism, causing their death [

Monoterpenes delay sclerotic differentiation and promote the generation of lipid peroxides, which can lead to cell death, while phenols present in the essential oil bond to the active sites of fungal enzymes through their hydroxyl group [
