<p>Some volatile compounds (L-camphor; DL-camphor, Î²-caryophyllene, and camphene) from 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> oil were as efficient as synthetic antifungal products such as flutriafol and hymexazol against 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> and 
 <italic>F. solani</italic>, in vitro [

 <italic>A. incisa</italic> were tested against 
 <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> with various results: two monoterpenes and one phenolic acid derivative were more active compared to flavones and coumarins, the latter being less active [
