<p>The extraction method influences the antifungal activity of the volatile oil, as can be seen from the investigation carried out by Julio et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-03061" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]: 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> oil obtained by steam pressure extraction was more effective in inhibiting mycelium growth than that obtained by hydrodistillation, which was due to a different ratio of the major volatile compounds. Similarly, 
 <italic>A. argyi</italic> essential oil obtained by simultaneous distillation–extraction had a higher antifungal activity compared to oils prepared by subcritical extraction or hydrodistillation. Although regardless of the extraction method, the oils had the same five major compounds, in the oil obtained by simultaneous distillation–extraction, the sesquiterpene compounds predominated [

 <italic>A. chamaemelifolia</italic> essential oil, the method of extraction—microwave-assisted hydrodistillation and classical hydrodistillation—had no influence on the inhibitory effect against the tested fungi. Both oils contained the same major compounds in comparable ratio [
