<p>Stored foods can be degraded by fungi such as 
 <italic>Alternaria</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp., and 
 <italic>Mucor</italic> spp., which reduce their quality and make them unsuitable or even toxic for consumption. The use of chemical products for the control of postharvest pathogens endangers the environment, human health, and can induce resistance to fungicides. Such being the case, some investigations tried to estimate the reduction of postharvest fungal spoilage after treatment with 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> extracts. Fumigation of table grapes with 
 <italic>A. nilagirica</italic> essential oil (200–300 µL) decreased the weight loss, berry shrinkage, and berry browning, increasing the shelf life for up to 10 days [

 <italic>A. nilagirica</italic> volatile oil at a concentration of 1.4 μL/mL in airtight containers provided 71% protection from fungal contamination after 12 months of storage to millet grains [
