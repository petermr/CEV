<p>Pathogenic fungi produce almost 30% of crop diseases, threatening the health and food security of a growing human population dependent on substantial agricultural production [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-03061" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Phytopathogenic fungi affect plants during their cultivation or after harvest, causing significant losses in crop plants. In addition, certain fungi (
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Alternaria</italic> spp. etc.) produce mycotoxins that endanger the health of consumers through hepatotoxic, nephrotoxic, and carcinogenic effects or even cause death [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-03061" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In an effort to find an ecological solution to this problem, numerous studies have assessed the antifungal effect of 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> species, focusing especially on volatile oil and compounds. Different methods of evaluation were used in vitro, in planta, or in field conditions, and the results were expressed in various ways: half maximal inhibitory concentration—IC
 <sub>50</sub>, minimal inhibitory concentration—MIC, minimum fungicidal concentration—MFC, median effective concentration—ED
 <sub>50</sub>, inhibition zone, and percent of inhibition (
