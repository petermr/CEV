<p>The type of extract, the part of the plant used, and the time of harvest also influence the antifungal activity, as underlined in a study carried out with methanol, ethanol, and hexane extracts of 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> against 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> niger and 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic>. Whole plant extract was the most efficient in inhibiting the growth of the two fungi, regardless of the type of extract, compared to root, leaf, or stem extracts. Regarding the extraction solvent, ethanol extract had the highest inhibitory effect, followed by methanol and hexane, on both fungal species. Although the harvesting period of the plant had little influence on the antifungal activity, most of the extracts made with the plant collected during anthesis were more active [
