<p>From analyzing literature data, it appears that sesquiterpenes components of the oil have significant antifungal activity. Oxygenated sesquiterpenes were the major components of 
 <italic>A. khorasanica</italic> volatile oil active against four soil-borne phytopathogenic fungi [

 <italic>Artemisia scoparia</italic> essential oil, rich in sesquiterpenes, was more efficient in inhibiting mycelial growth and spore germination of 
 <italic>Alternaria solani</italic> compared to 
 <italic>A. lavandulaefolia</italic> and, especially, 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> oils, where monoterpenes were the major compounds. Furthermore, the mode of volatile oil administration influences the outcome: 
 <italic>A. lavandulaefolia</italic> oil was more effective when applied by fumigation than when mixed in the agar medium [
