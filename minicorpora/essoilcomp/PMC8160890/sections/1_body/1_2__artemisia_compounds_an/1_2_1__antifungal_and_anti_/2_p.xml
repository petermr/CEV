<p>The in vitro antifungal activity was frequently determined by the agar diffusion test, which involves placing the tested plant extract in wells or paper discs on the agar plate previously inoculated with the pathogen [

 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-03061" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Since essential oils diffuse less in the culture medium, it was preferred to include them in agar after prior solubilization, followed by inoculation of the pathogen [

In vivo antifungal evaluations involved treating the plants with the tested compounds/extracts by spraying them followed by inoculation with the fungal pathogen or by including the compounds in the soil and then planting the inoculated seedling in the treated soil. The disease severity was assessed after a period of infection [
