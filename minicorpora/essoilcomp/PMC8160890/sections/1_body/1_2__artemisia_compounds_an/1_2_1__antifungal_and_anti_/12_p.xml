<p>In addition to the direct inhibition of postharvest phytopathogenic fungi, some studies also evaluated the mycotoxins suppression ability of plant extracts. For instance, 
 <italic>Artemisia herba-alba</italic> keto-rich essential oil completely inhibited the toxin production (penicillic acid, terrestric acid, brevianamide A, aurantiamine, xanthomegnin) for 
 <italic>P. aurantiogriseum</italic> at 0.44% and for 
 <italic>P. viridicatum</italic> at 0.22% [

 <italic>Artemisia nilagirica</italic> essential oil inhibited the production of aflatoxin B
 <sub>1</sub> by 
 <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> toxigenic strain at 1 µL/mL. A common seed contaminant, aflatoxin B1 is a powerful human carcinogen and a serious health risk; it also contributes to food deterioration by lipid peroxidation [

 <italic>A. nilagirica</italic> volatile oil (0.16 µL/mL) completely inhibited the production of aflatoxin B
 <sub>1</sub> by 
 <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> and ochratoxin A by 
 <italic>A. niger</italic> and 
 <italic>A. ochraceus</italic> [
