<p>Most

 <italic>Penicillium</italic> species. Fungi have different susceptibility to varied antifungal compounds: for example, 
 <italic>Fusarium solani</italic> was moderately sensitive to the action of isolated substances from 
 <italic>A. sieberi</italic> (two sesquiterpene lactones and one methoxylated flavone), while 
 <italic>Alternaria alternata</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> were resistant [

 <italic>A. campestris</italic> and resistant to 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> extract, despite similar quantities of flavonoids and phenolic compounds. Quercetin was reported in higher amounts in 
 <italic>A. campestris</italic> extract and seems to be correlated with antifungal activity [
