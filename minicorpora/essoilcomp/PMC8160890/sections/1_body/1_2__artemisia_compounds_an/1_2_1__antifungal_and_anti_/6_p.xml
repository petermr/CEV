<p>Alongside the sesquiterpenes, it seems that thujones present in high amounts in the volatile oil are associated with intense antifungal activity [

 <xref rid="B42-molecules-26-03061" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. To prove this point, Shafi et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-26-03061" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] used a mixture of thujones (α-thujone, β-thujone, and fenchone) at the same concentration instead of 
 <italic>A. nilagirica</italic> oil to achieve the same result against 
 <italic>Phytophthora capsici</italic>—100% inhibition. Borneol was also tested in the aforementioned study and showed no antifungal activity. On the other hand, the antifungal property of 
 <italic>A. terrae-albae</italic> essential oil against 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> spp. was associated with the presence of camphor, 1,8-cineole, camphene, α- and β-thujone, borneol, and the high content of oxygenated monoterpenes [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-26-03061" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Other oxygenated monoterpenes, piperitone and carvone, were correlated with the antifungal activity on 
 <italic>Penicillium citrinum</italic> and 
 <italic>Mucor rouxii</italic>; the two ketones are major components of 
 <italic>A. herba-alba</italic> volatile oil [
