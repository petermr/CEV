<p>The antifungal mode of action of 
 <italic>A. nilagirica</italic> essential oil was investigated by Kumar et al. The fungal cells treated with 1.4 Î¼L/mL volatile oil exhibited important deformity and shrinkage, detachment of plasma membrane from the cell wall, and development of lomasomes. At the same dose, 
 <italic>A. nilagirica</italic> essential oil completely inhibited ergosterol synthesis in the cell membrane of
