 <italic>Convolvulus arvensis</italic> at 1–4% concentration in a Petri dish and pot experiment. It significantly reduced the level of photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotenoids) and of antioxidant enzymes (catalase, peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase, superoxide dismutase), as well as enhancing the production of hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde. It seems that volatile oil compounds—mostly oxygenated monoterpenes—inhibited the electron transport chain and affected the process of photosynthesis, leading to an increased production of oxygen reactive species. In turn, these intensified the lipid peroxidation of the cell membrane followed by electrolyte leakage [
