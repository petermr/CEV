<p>The phytotoxicity of isolated compounds from 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> was evaluated against two monocots and five dicots (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03061-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The suppression of germination and seedling growth varies in the order: artemisinin&gt;arteannuin B&gt;artemisinic acid. 
 <italic>Raphanus sativus</italic> was the most resistant to the action of tested compounds, followed by 
 <italic>Secale cereale</italic>. The weaker activity of arteannuin B and artemisinic acid—molecules without an endoperoxide bridge—implies that the moiety is important for the phytotoxic effect [
