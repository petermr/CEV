<p>In vivo tests proved that artemisinin is a potent suppressor of photosynthetic activity through the formation of a highly reactive artemisinin-metabolite that is able to inhibit the photosynthetic electron flow [

 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> seedlings, artemisinin (1, 2, 5, 20, 100 ÂµM) reduced the root gravitropic responses, elongation of primary and lateral roots, root hairs density, and length. Furthermore, artemisinin diminished starch grain and auxin concentrations and affected auxin redistribution in root tips [
