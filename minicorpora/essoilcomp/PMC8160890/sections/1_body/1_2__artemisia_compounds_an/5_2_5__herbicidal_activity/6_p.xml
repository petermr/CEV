<p>Major constituents of

 <italic>Amaranthus retroflexus</italic>. The phytotoxic effect of α-thujone, eucalyptol, camphor, and the mixture of these compounds was inferior to that of the essential oil, which suggests that probably other volatile components are causing the herbicidal activity of the oil [
