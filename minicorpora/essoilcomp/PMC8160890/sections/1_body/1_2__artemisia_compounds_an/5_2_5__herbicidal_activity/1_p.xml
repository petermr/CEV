<p>One of the most influential groups of plant secondary metabolites is the allelochemicals. They are released into the environment in order to affect the germination, growth, behavior, survival, and reproduction of competing plants, which is a process better known as allelopathy. They are produced mainly in the plantâ€™s roots, seeds, flowers, and leaves, and their synthesis depends on the changes of the climate conditions as well as exposure to biotic or abiotic stress. Allelochemicals activity can be harmful or beneficial for the growth and survival of target species [
