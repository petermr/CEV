<p>The sensitivity of different weed species to a certain herbicide varies greatly. Among eight weeds tested in a study, 
 <italic>Amaranthus retroflexus, Echinochloa cruss-galli,</italic> and 
 <italic>Reseda lutea</italic> were more susceptible to the action of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> essential oil, compared to 
 <italic>Rumex crispus, Agrostemma githago, Trifolium pretense, Chenopodium album,</italic> and 
 <italic>Cardaria draba,</italic> which were more resistant [

 <italic>Parthenium hysterophorus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ageratum conyzoides</italic> were more vulnerable to the inhibitory effect of 
 <italic>Artemisia scoparia</italic> volatile oil, in comparison with 
 <italic>Cassia occidentalis</italic>, under laboratory conditions. In another test, 
 <italic>Echinochloa crus-galli</italic> and 
 <italic>Parthenium hysterophorus</italic> were more affected by post-emergence application of the oil [
