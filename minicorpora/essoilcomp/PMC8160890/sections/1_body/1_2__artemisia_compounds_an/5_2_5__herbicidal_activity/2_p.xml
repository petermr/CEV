 <xref rid="B110-molecules-26-03061" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>], so it was expected that numerous studies would investigate their herbicide potential on various weeds. Most researchers focused on the volatile oils, and only a few dealt with aqueous or alcoholic extracts (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03061-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The phytotoxic effect of essential oils is owed to multiple mechanisms of action: inhibition of cell division, decrease of mitochondrial respiration, reduction of photosynthetic pigments and photosynthesis, generation of radical oxygen species in excess and oxidative impairment, destruction of waxy cuticular layer, inhibition of enzymes activity, water uptake, and alteration of gibberellic acid content [

 <xref rid="B112-molecules-26-03061" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Most of these actions are correlated with the presence of oxygenated monoterpenes. For example,1,8-cineole and camphor inhibit DNA synthesis, cell proliferation, and elongation [
