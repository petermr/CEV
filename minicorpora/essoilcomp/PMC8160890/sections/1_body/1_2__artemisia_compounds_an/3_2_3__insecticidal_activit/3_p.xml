 <italic>Artemisia</italic> compounds can influence insects by direct contact or fumigation, can repel insects or keep them from feeding, or can hinder their reproduction. Volatile compounds can induce toxicity to insects via inhalation or direct contact by forming an impermeable film on the cuticle leading to suffocation. Some volatile components can penetrate through the cuticle, affecting cellular membrane function and oxidative phosphorylation [

Phytochemicals such as cinnamyl alcohol, eugenol, and trans-anethole can activate octopamine receptors, interfering with the normal activity of octopamine, a neurotransmitter, neuromodulator, and neurohormone in an invertebrate system [

In addition, plant substances may cause the suppression of cytochrome P450 in insects (the enzymes responsible for phase I metabolism of xenobiotics) and may alter various biochemical processes, which shift the balance of the endocrine system [
