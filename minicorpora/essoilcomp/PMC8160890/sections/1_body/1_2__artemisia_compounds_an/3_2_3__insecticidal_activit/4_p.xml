<p>The activity of 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> compounds and extracts depends on the solvent used, the susceptibility of pest species to the active substance, the development stage of the insect, whether it is male or female, and the method of application. 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03061-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> lists the more recent studies on insecticidal activity of 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> genus. Essential oils and volatile compounds can be applied via fumigation, which is a procedure used frequently in the pest management of stored products. This method has obvious advantages such as the possibility to spread the substance evenly, even in unreachable places, and the ability to maintain an effective level of insecticides within a closed space [

Some of the shortcomings of natural insecticides are poor water solubility and rapid degradation in the environment, leading to low persistence and poor efficiency. To solve these problems, plant insecticides may be formulated as micro- and nanocapsules, nanoparticles, or nanoemulsions. These nanoformulations can increase the solubility, persistence, and stability of bioinsecticides, enhancing their activity and, at the same time, limiting their negative impact on the environment [
