<p>The global use of synthetic pesticides has many disadvantages, such as high cost, danger to non-target organisms, accumulation of pesticide residues in the environment, the emergence of resistant phytopathogenic strains, and negative impact on human health [

In contrast, biological pesticides can achieve pest management in an environmentally friendly way and could become safer alternatives for the treatment of crop diseases. Many agents are considered biopesticides, such as viruses, microbes, fungi, entomophagous invertebrates, parasitoids, predators, and substances produced by living organisms such as bacteria, fungi, plants, algae, animals, etc. Throughout this review, we will use the word “biopesticides” for plant-derived substances or extracts. During evolution, plants developed different mechanisms to defend themselves from predators and diseases by producing substances with bactericidal, fungicidal, insecticidal, nematicidal, or repellent activity. At present, these phytochemicals are explored as biocontrol agents for crops integrated pest management. Plant compounds are cheaper, safer for farmers, less toxic to non-target organisms, and rapidly degraded in the environment [
