<p>In this context, numerous researchers have identified new potential biopesticides in plants of the 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> genus. Since most species are fragrant, the vast majority of investigations have focused on the biological actions of volatile oils and compounds. Essential oils contain a variety of volatile molecules such as mono- and sesquiterpenes as well as phenolic-derived aromatic and aliphatic components [

The percentage of individual compounds in the essential oil is variable and depends on genetic factors (species, chemotype), plant origin, plant organ, period of harvest or developmental stage, environmental factors (climate, altitude, sun exposure), and cultivation conditions. Qualitative and quantitative differences in the composition of the essential oil can also be caused by drying methods, extraction procedure and time, quantification methods, and conditions of analysis [

All these elements could change the chemical composition of an essential oil, leading to changes in activity; thus, standardization is necessary to guarantee the effect, and also for regulatory and marketing purposes. Moreover, plants with desirable pesticide action may give low yields of essential oil, hence the need for new and more efficient extraction methods, which will increase the quantity and quality of extracted oil while reducing the time and cost of extraction [
