<p>This review focuses on significant and recent data related to the secondary metabolitesâ€™ activity of 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> species against plant pests and to the appropriate formulation and application of these biopesticides. The review has been assembled using references from major databases such as PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, SpringerLink, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. There is an abundance of papers that evaluate the pesticide activity of 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> species in vitro, but only a handful include 
 <italic>in planta</italic> or greenhouse experiments, and even fewer contain field tests. Furthermore, there is a shortage of studies regarding the effect on non-target organisms. Since various compounds and extracts, especially essential oils, are not suitable for use in their raw state (due to volatilization, toxicity, poor solubility, degradation, etc.), different formulations may be used in order to increase the stability and efficiency of biopesticides [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-03061" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Consequently, the review also includes an analysis of nano-sized formulations based on 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> spp.
