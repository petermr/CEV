<p>Finally, for 
 <italic>C. ladanifer</italic>, the lowest yield values were obtained (0.036 and 0.037%). If these values are compared with the literature consulted (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03257-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), it can be observed that they are lower than those obtained on a laboratory scale, between 0.10 and 0.63 (% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic> d.b.) but similar to the values corresponding to pilot-scale process, between 0.01 and 0.04 (%
