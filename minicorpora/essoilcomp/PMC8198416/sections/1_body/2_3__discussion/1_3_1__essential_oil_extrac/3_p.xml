<p>As we can observe in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03257-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the species with the highest yield in this study was 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic> (1.59 and 1.93%). However, considering the data shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03257-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, its yield here is much lower than those obtained by other authors using lab devices, namely, 2.3% [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-26-03257" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], 2.7% [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-26-03257" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and 3.9% [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-26-03257" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], but higher than the value of 0.5% obtained in a prior study using an industrial device [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-26-03257" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Considering the values obtained on a laboratory scale (0.7â€“1.5%) from the literature for 
 <italic>E. nitens</italic> [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-26-03257" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-26-03257" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-26-03257" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and the yield obtained in this study (0.45 and 0.57%), it can be observed that the yield from this species is lower than the value corresponding to 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic>.
