 <italic>P. pinaster</italic>, many references have been found (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03257-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In most cases, these studies used pine needles for the distillations, and the yields were higher than those obtained in this work. The reported yields reached values higher than 0.8%, compared to 0.15% and 0.18% obtained in the species analyzed here.
