<p>The antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> essential oils evaluated by various testing methods had been reported in earlier studies. The antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic> essential oil evaluated by ORAC assay resulted in higher values than the values previously reported by Miguel et al. [
 <xref rid="B81-molecules-26-03257" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. However, the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>E. nitens</italic> has not been investigated in the literature. According to the results presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03257-f002">Figure 2</xref>, the antioxidant activity of the 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> essential oils did not show significant differences between the two studied species (
 <italic>E. globulus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. nitens</italic>) and the two different collection periods. Neither did Miguel et al. [
 <xref rid="B81-molecules-26-03257" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] find significant differences among antioxidant activity (ORAC and TEAC methods) of 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic> and some other 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> species. The most antioxidant active components of essential oils were thymol and carvacrol (oxygenated monoterpenes) [

 <xref rid="B83-molecules-26-03257" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. However, essential oils of 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. nitens</italic> contain scarcely any amount of these compounds. In fact, the major component found in these 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> essential oils was 1,8-cineole, which showed low antioxidant activity [

 <xref rid="B83-molecules-26-03257" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. On the other hand, some oxygenated sesquiterpenes analyzed have demonstrated a similar strong antioxidant activity to the oxygenated monoterpenes [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-03257" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], which could support the relationship between antioxidant activity and oxygenated sesquiterpenes of essential oils deduced from our data. Clearly, the antioxidant activity of essential oils may be due to minor components with important antioxidant activity. Although the chemical complexity of essential oilsâ€™ compounds and synergistic and antagonistic effects between these compounds could affect the antioxidant activity [
