<p>Finally, concerning 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic>, two major types of rosemary oil are reported in the literature. The first one with more than 40% of 1,8-cineole and present in Morocco, Tunisia, Turkey, Greece, Yugoslavia, Italy, and France, and the second one with approximately equal ratios of 1,8-cineole, α-pinene, and camphor, and present in France, Spain, Italy, Greece, and Bulgaria [

Considering the composition of the two samples analyzed in the present work, where camphor (24.39 and 29.96%), 1,8-cineole (10.71 and 15.73%), and α-pinene (14.61 and 11.75%) are the main components, a greater similarity with the second type can be seen. If these values are compared with those obtained in a different study carried out with 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> plants from Spain [
 <xref rid="B78-molecules-26-03257" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], it can be observed that they are in the same order of magnitude. Furthermore, the essential oils analyzed in the above-mentioned study also showed high contents of camphene, β-pinene, β-caryophyllene, limonene, borneol, and myrcene, as the essential oils analyzed in the present work.
