<p>Comparing the analysis results of 
 <italic>C. ladanifer</italic> essential oil with some works from the literature, the results obtained for α-pinene are within the limits found in samples of commercial essential oils from Spain (48.9–50.4%) [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-26-03257" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and Portugal (29.8–59.5%) [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-03257" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The same trend is observed for bornyl acetate (1.5–3.1% in Spanish essential oils and 2.6–6.1% in Portuguese essential oils), camphene (2.4–5.0% in Spanish essential oils and 2.6–14.7% in Portuguese essential oils), and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-pinocarveol (1.7–2.8% in Spanish essential oils and 1.8–5.9% in Portuguese essential oils). However, higher values of viridiflorol are found in the essential oils analyzed in this work when compared with the limits found in the mentioned Spanish essential oils (1.1–1.7%) and Portuguese essential oils (0.8–1.9%).
