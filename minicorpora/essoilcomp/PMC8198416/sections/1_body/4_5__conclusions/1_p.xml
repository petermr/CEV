<p>The exploitation of essential oils obtained from residues of tree and shrub species foliage produced in some forestry enhancement operations could be an incentive to increase forest management while obtaining natural products with added value. In this sense, regarding the yield of the production of essential oil, interesting results are obtained with 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. nitens</italic>, considering the tree species, and with 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> and 
 <italic>J. communis</italic>, considering the shrub species. Since there are significant differences between the yields obtained with the biomass collected from these species in two different years, more research must be conducted regarding the influence of different factors related to the plant and the weather conditions on the essential oil yield.
