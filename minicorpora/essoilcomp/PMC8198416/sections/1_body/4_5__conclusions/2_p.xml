<p>In general, the essential oil yields obtained on a pilot scale using the operating conditions described in this work are lower than those performed on a laboratory scale and reported in the literature. Therefore, this study is a step toward the production of essential oils using industrial equipment, although more research must be conducted to optimize the operating conditions during the extraction with the aim of obtaining results that can be extrapolated to an industrial scale.</p>
