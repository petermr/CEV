<p>The freshly ground samples were distilled in a 30 L stainless steel still using steam produced in an electric boiler (ETE, Madrid, Spain). The steam conditions used for the extractions were 15 kg/h of steam with a boiler pressure of 50 kPa. Batch extractions were carried out, with three repetitions of 5 kg each per sample and an extraction duration of 30 min for each batch. Time was measured from the moment the first drop of distillate fell. The temperature inside the still was kept constant at 98 °C. The hydrolate and the essential oil were separated by density using a glass Florentine flask, and the samples were collected in glass flasks. They were then dried using anhydrous sodium sulfate. After filtration, they were weighed and stored in brown bottles at a temperature of 4 °C until further analysis. The oil yield for each sample was calculated as a percentage (
