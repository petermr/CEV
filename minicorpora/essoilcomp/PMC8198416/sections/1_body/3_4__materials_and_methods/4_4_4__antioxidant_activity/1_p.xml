<p>Antioxidant activity of essential oils was determined with oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) methods, as described by Dávalos et al. [
 <xref rid="B95-molecules-26-03257" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Previously, the essential oils were diluted with ethanol (1%). The assay was carried out in 75 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with the final reaction volume of 200 μL, including 20 μL of the diluted sample, blank or Trolox (used as standard curve 1–8 μM Trolox in each assay), 120 μL of fluorescein solution and 60 μL of AAPH solution, dispensed in a 96-well microplate (NUNC A/S, Roskilde, Denmark) and loaded into a microplate reader (FLUOstar Optima, BMG, Labtech Inc., Durham, NC, USA). The fluorescence was recorded every minute for 104 min (kex = 485 nm, kem = 520 nm). ORAC values were expressed as μmol Trolox equivalents/g of essential oil and were calculated from the regression equation of Trolox concentrations and net area under the fluorescence decay curve, which was generated by FLUOstar Optima software (V2.1 0 R4, BMG Labtech Inc., Durham, NC, USA). All samples were analyzed in triplicate.
