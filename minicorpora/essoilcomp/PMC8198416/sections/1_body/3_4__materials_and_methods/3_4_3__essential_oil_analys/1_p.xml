<p>An apparatus Agilent HP 8890/5977 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used to identify the essential oil components, and an apparatus Agilent HP 8890 (GC–FID) (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was employed to quantify the identified components. Both of them were equipped with DB-WAX UI-fused silica columns (60 m × 0.25 mm inner diameter, film thickness 0.5 µm) and retention time locking. The column temperature program was 50 °C for 6 min, followed by an increase of 2 °C/min to reach 190 °C; then, a gradient of 4 °C/min to 220 °C was used, and it was maintained for 10 min. Finally, an increase of 4 °C/min was employed to reach 250 °C, which was maintained for 10 min. The carrier gas was helium at a variable flow rate and a head pressure of 30.75 psi. The injection volume was 0.1 µL and split mode injection (ratio 1:100) was used. The temperatures of the injector and detector were 240 °C. GC–MS was performed with the same capillary column, carrier gas, and operating conditions described for GC analysis. Mass spectra were taken over the
