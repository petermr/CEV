<p>The main components identified and their quantification considering the relative area percentage are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-03257">Tables S1–S5 from Supplementary Materials</xref>. It can be observed that the main components of the samples of 
 <italic>C. ladanifer</italic> essential oil were α-pinene (51.93 and 39.11%), followed by viridiflorol (6.40 and 10.21%), bornyl acetate (2.89 and 3.16%), camphene (2.42 and 3.13%), 
 <italic>trans</italic>-pinocarveol (2.15 and 2.22%), and ledol (1.84 and 2.94%). With regard to the 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> essential oils considered, both species showed very high contents of 1,8-cineole (45.02 and 61.26% in 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic> and 73.01 and 73.00% in 
 <italic>E. nitens</italic>), followed by α-pinene (17.70 and 15.89% in 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic> and 11.43 and 10.28% in 
 <italic>E. nitens</italic>), aromadendrene (7.20% but only in the sample corresponding to the first period for 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic>), limonene (4.41 and 5.26% in 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic>, and 2.69 and 2.52% in 
 <italic>E. nitens</italic>), α-terpinyl acetate (4.54 and 4.24%, only in 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic>), 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (2.44 and 0.34% in 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic>, and 0.53 and 0.68% in 
 <italic>E. nitens</italic>) and globulol (2.21 and 1.41%, only in 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic>). Concerning the analysis of the 
 <italic>J. communis</italic> essential oils, it can be noticed that both samples showed high contents of sabinene (17.57 and 34.29%) and α-pinene (21.12 and 16.26%), followed by limonene (5.78 and 7.89%), terpinen-4-ol (2.10 and 5.70%), β-myrcene (2.92 and 4.95%), β-phellandrene (2.57 and 3.75%), γ-terpinene (1.41 and 2.56%) and α-thujene (1.60 and 2.51%). On the other hand, thujopsene (12.36%) and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-β-caryophyllene (3.13%) were noticeable in the sample corresponding to the first period. Considering the 
 <italic>Pinus</italic> essential oils analyzed, α-pinene and β-pinene were the main components detected; thus, 
 <italic>P. pinaster</italic> samples had 27.13 and 25.50% of α-pinene and 29.44 and 18.80% of β-pinene, and 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic> samples had 45.12 and 51.78% of α-pinene and 8.94 and 19.82% of β-pinene. Both species also showed high contents of β-myrcene (5.97 and 9.45% in 
 <italic>P. pinaster</italic>, and 12.19 and 2.14% in 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic>), 
 <italic>trans</italic>-β-caryophyllene (8.31 and 12.06% in 
 <italic>P. pinaster</italic>, and 6.87 and 3.91% in 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic>), germacrene D (4.05 and 10.37% in 
 <italic>P. pinaster</italic>, and 6.87 and 4.33% in 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic>) and limonene (3.23 and 4.35% in 
 <italic>P. pinaster</italic>, and 1.14 and 3.91% in 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic>). Moreover, 
 <italic>P. pinaster</italic> showed 2.11 and 1.70% of longifolene and 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic> 3.54 and 3.63% of camphene. Finally, the main components of the samples of 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> essential oil were camphor (24.39 and 29.96%), 1,8-cineole (10.71 and 15.73%), and α-pinene (14.61 and 11.75%), followed by camphene (9.70 and 8.00%), β-myrcene (7.96 and 5.62%), limonene (5.96 and 4.52%), β-pinene (4.17 and 4.27%), 
 <italic>trans</italic>-β-caryophyllene (3.39 and 1.93%), 3-octanone (3.21 and 2.42%), bornyl acetate (2.22 and 1.05%), and borneol (2.11 and 1.91%).
