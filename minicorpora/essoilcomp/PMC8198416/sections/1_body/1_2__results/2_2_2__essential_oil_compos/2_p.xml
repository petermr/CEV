<p>Monoterpene hydrocarbons were the main component of the essential oils of 
 <italic>C. ladanifer</italic> (62.67 and 49.46%), 
 <italic>J. communis</italic> (59.19 and 79.58%), 
 <italic>P. pinaster</italic> (67.90 and 60.57%), and 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic> (74.24 and 84.84%). On the other hand, the essential oils of 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. nitens</italic> showed high contents of oxygenated monoterpenes (52.19 and 68.85% for 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic>, and 79.58 and 80.46% for 
 <italic>E. nitens</italic>). Finally, high contents of both monoterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated monoterpenes were remarkable in the 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> essential oil, with values of 46.01 and 37.75% for monoterpene hydrocarbons and 43.41 and 53.95% for oxygenated monoterpenes. With regard to sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, the sample corresponding to the 
 <italic>J. communis</italic> essential oil of the first sampling period showed the highest value (34.20%), followed by the sample corresponding to the 
 <italic>P. pinaster</italic> essential oil of the second sampling period (33.53%). Concerning the oxygenated sesquiterpenes, the highest values were analyzed in the essential oils of 
 <italic>C. ladanifer</italic> (9.47 and 15.35%).
