 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03257-f002">Figure 2</xref> represents the antioxidant activity of essential oils measured by ORAC (oxygen radical absorbance capacity) assay and expressed as μmol Trolox per gram of essential oil from plants collected in the first and second periods. All studied essential oils showed antioxidant activity, values ranged from 209.36 to 72.75 μmol Trolox/gram of essential oil. Significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) differences were observed between ORAC values of some studied species and between the two collection periods of 
 <italic>C. ladanifer, J. communis,</italic> and 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic>. The essential oil with the highest antioxidant activity was obtained from 
 <italic>C. ladanifer</italic>, in contrast to the lowest activity detected in 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic> oil. The essential oils of plants collected in the second period presented higher antioxidant activity (22–8%) than those collected in the first period, except those belonging to genus 
 <italic>Pinus</italic>.
