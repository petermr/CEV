 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-03257" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], the distribution area of most of the species being studied is considerable. The largest surface area is covered by 
 <italic>C. ladanifer</italic> (1.7 Mha), followed by 
 <italic>P. pinaster</italic> (1.35 Mha), 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> (1.3 Mha),

 <italic>E. globulus</italic> (625,000 ha), 
 <italic>J. communis</italic> (60,000 ha), and finally, 
 <italic>E. nitens</italic>, with 12,000 ha. The surface area of 
 <italic>E. nitens</italic> may be larger since it is a species that is commonly used in new wood production plantations in northern Spain.
