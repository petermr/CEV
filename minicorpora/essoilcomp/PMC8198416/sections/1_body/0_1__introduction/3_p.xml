<p>If climate change forecasts are taken into account, fire-prone conditions are predicted to increase across the world and especially in territories with Mediterranean climates, such as the Mediterranean Basin, the North American West Coast, and Australia. Scientists agree that climate change will drive vegetation shifts toward drought-resistant species [

 <xref rid="B6-molecules-26-03257" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In this respect, and especially in Mediterranean regions, adaptation means maintaining forest fuel densities under environmentally acceptable levels that allow us to ensure that the risk and virulence of forest fires are as low as possible [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-03257" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Therefore, forestry management by clearing scrub and tree vegetation must be a priority in fire-fighting plans. However, clearing, pruning, and forest enhancement operations, in general, are costly and require a great amount of economic resources. In that sense, scientists and experts agree that a paradigm shift is needed from the current approach, which is based primarily on extinguishing fires and costly preventive silviculture, toward a new model based on cost-effective forest management [
