<p>Understanding the contribution of each plant part to the essential oil of lavender provides insight into proper cultivation and harvesting practices, as well as a better understanding of authentication of natural lavender essential oil. Authentic lavender essential oil has low levels of camphor, typically lower than the upper limit established by the lavender ISO standard [

 <xref rid="B35-molecules-26-02343" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Elevated levels of camphor are an indicator of the addition of lavandin Grosso and/or spike lavender, which have camphor levels of 6–8.5% and 8–16%, respectively [

 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-02343" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. When determining the quality and authenticity of lavender essential oil, distinguishing the cause of elevated camphor levels between natural (corolla and/or leaf from lavender) and unnatural origin (addition of spike lavender and/or lavandin Grosso) is important. Factors such as the developmental stage of the inflorescences and the amount of leaf material harvested impact the overall aromatic profile of lavender essential oil.
