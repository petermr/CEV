<p>This study confirms that the calyx is the main site of essential oil accumulation and establishes, for the first time, the complete aromatic profile of the corolla and calyx. The calyx has the highest yield, followed by the whole flowering top, corolla, and leaf. The calyx and whole flowering top have similar aromatic profiles, with prominent compounds being linalool acetate, linalool, lavandulyl acetate, terpinen-4-ol, (
 <italic>Z</italic>)-β-ocimene, and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-ocimene. Interestingly, the profiles of both the calyx and whole flowering top are consistent with the lavender ISO standard ranges as previously defined under cultivated lavender from the United States. However, neither profile for the corolla or leaf alone are consistent with the lavender ISO standard ranges [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-26-02343" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Linalool acetate, linalool, and lavandulyl acetate are prominent in the corolla, as are borneol and the sesquiterpenoid epi-α-cadinol. Prominent compounds in the leaf essential oil include epi-α-cadinol, γ-cadinene, borneol, caryophyllene oxide, and bornyl acetate.
