<p>This study also establishes the influence exerted by the corolla and leaf, through both yield and unique profile, on the aromatic profile of the whole flowering top. While previous studies established both the qualitative and quantitative contribution of various plant parts to the essential oil of lavender [

The yield of both the corolla and leaf are substantially lower than that of the calyx, yet several prominent compounds in both oils (i.e., 1,8-cineole, camphor, borneol, lavandulyl acetate, γ-cadinene, caryophyllene oxide, epi-α-cadinol) contribute to the overall profile of the flowering top.
