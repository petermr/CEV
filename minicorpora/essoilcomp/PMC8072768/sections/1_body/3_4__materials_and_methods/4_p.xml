<p>Essential oils were analyzed, and volatile compounds identified, by GC/MS using an Agilent 7890B GC/5977B MSD and J&amp;W DB-5, 0.25 mm × 60 m, 0.25 μm film thickness, fused silica capillary column. Operating conditions: 0.1 μL of sample (20% soln. for essential oils in hexane), 150:1 split ratio, initial oven temperature of 40 °C with an initial hold time of 5 min, oven ramp rate of 4.5 °C per minute to 310 °C with a hold time of 5 min. The electron ionization energy was 70 eV, scan range 35–650 amu, scan rate 2.4 scans per second, source temperature 230 °C, and quadrupole temperature 150 °C. Volatile compounds were identified using the Adams volatile oil library [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-02343" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] using Chemstation library search in conjunction with retention indices. Note that limonene/β-phellandrene, lavandulol/borneol, and α-trans-bergamotene/coumarin elute as single peaks. Their amounts were determined by the ratio of masses 68 and 79 (limonene), 77 and 93 (β-phellandrene), 69 and 111 (lavandulol), 95 and 110 (borneol), 93 and 119 (α-trans-bergamotene), and 118 and 146 (coumarin). Volatile compounds were quantified and are reported as a relative area percent by GC-FID using an Agilent 7890B and J&amp;W DB-5, 0.25 mm × 60 m, 0.25 μm film thickness, fused silica capillary column. Operating conditions: 0.1 μL of sample (20% soln. for essential oils in hexane, 1% for reference compounds in hexane, 0.1% soln. for C7–C30 alkanes in hexane), 25:1 split injection, initial oven temperature at 40 °C with an initial hold time of 2 min, oven ramp rate of 3.0 °C per minute to 250 °C with a hold time of 3 min. Essential oil samples were analyzed in triplicate. Compounds were identified using retention indices coupled with the retention time data of reference compounds (MilliporeSigma, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MS, USA).
