<p>Plant material was prepared for laboratory-scale distillation as follows: corolla, calyx, leaf, and whole flowering top were separated, bagged, and stored at −20 ± 2 °C until steam distilled. Steam distillation was performed in triplicate, resulting in 3 distillations per plant portion and 12 distillations over the course of this project.</p>
