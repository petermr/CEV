<p>The plant part used for extraction is an additional factor that affects both the yield and the volatile profile of lavender essential oil. Previous studies have shown that linalool, linalool acetate, lavandulyl acetate, and α-terpineol are the predominant constituents in the essential oil extracted from the flowering top, and yield was significantly higher in essential oil extracted from the flowering top compared to the stem [

 <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic> corolla, calyx, leaf, and flowering top (including corolla, calyx, stem, and leaf) cultivated in Utah, USA are established and compared. Distillation yields of the various plant parts are also reported. Results provide further insight into cultivation and harvesting practices, and into the authentication of lavender.
