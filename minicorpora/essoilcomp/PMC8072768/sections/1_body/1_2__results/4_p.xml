<p>Prominent aromatic compounds of the corolla include linalool acetate (18.4%), linalool (10.8%), epi-α-cadinol (10.0%), borneol (7.3%), and lavandulyl acetate (6.3%). Prominent aromatic compounds of the leaf include epi-α-cadinol (19.8%), γ-cadinene (11.0%), borneol (6.0%), caryophyllene oxide (4.9%), and bornyl acetate (4.8%). Several sesquiterpenoids are prominent in both the corolla and leaf, and show a decreasing trend from leaf, corolla, and whole flowering top, to calyx: γ-cadinene (11.0%, 5.1%, 0.7%, 0.4%), caryophyllene oxide (4.9%, 4.9%, 0.3%, 0.1%), and epi-α-cadinol (19.8%, 10.0%, 1.3%, 1.1%), respectively. While the yield of both corolla and leaf are substantially lower than that of the calyx, the unique profiles of both portions contribute to the overall profile of the flowering top. For instance, relative amounts of camphor, borneol, and lavandulyl acetate in the flowering top are influenced by both the corolla and leaf (
