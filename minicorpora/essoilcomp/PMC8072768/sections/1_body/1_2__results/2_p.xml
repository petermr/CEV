 <xref rid="B37-molecules-26-02343" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], the calyx is the main site of essential oil accumulation (yield 1.3%). However, this study found that the corolla had the next highest yield (0.1%), followed by the leaf (0.05%). The whole flowering top, composed of corolla, calyx, stem, and leaf, had a yield of 0.7%.
