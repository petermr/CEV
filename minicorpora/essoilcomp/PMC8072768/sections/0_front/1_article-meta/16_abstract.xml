  <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic> Mill. (lavender) is an essential-oil-bearing plant in the Lamiaceae family. Volatile oil produced through the steam distillation of lavender was examined to establish the essential oil yield and aromatic profile from each portion of the plant—namely, the corolla, calyx, leaf, and whole flowering top. The resulting essential oils were analyzed by GC-FID and GC-MS. The different plant parts generally shared similar compounds but in varying relative percentages. Aromatic profiles of the whole flowering top and calyx were similar, with prominent compounds being linalool acetate (34.3%, 32.0%), linalool (26.5%, 32.9%), lavandulyl acetate (5.6%, 4.9%), terpinen-4-ol (5.3%, 7.0%), and (
  <italic>Z</italic>)-β-ocimene (4.5%, 5.4%), respectively. Aromatic profiles for the corolla and leaf were unique. Prominent aromatic compounds of the corolla included linalool acetate (18.4%), linalool (10.8%), epi-α-cadinol (10.0%), borneol (7.3%), and lavandulyl acetate (6.3%). Prominent aromatic compounds of the leaf included epi-α-cadinol (19.8%), γ-cadinene (11.0%), borneol (6.0%), caryophyllene oxide (4.9%), and bornyl acetate (4.8%). Complete profiles and essential oil yields of corolla, calyx, leaf, and whole flowering top were established. This study establishes the influence the corolla, calyx, and leaf exert on the aromatic profile of the whole flowering top and provides insight into authentication of lavender essential oil.
