<p id="Par9">The EtOAc extract (3.0 g) of the roots of 
 <italic>O. cufodontii</italic> was adsorbed and subjected to silica gel (150 g) column chromatography with increasing polarities of EtOAc in 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane as eluent to give 41 fractions, each 50 mL. Fraction 7 eluted with 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane:EtOAc (9:1) afford compound
