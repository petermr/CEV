<p id="Par35">The higher absorbance of the extract indicates a higher ferric reducing power. As clearly seen from Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>, the FRAP values for HLE, EALE, HRE and EARE were 0.090, 0.087, 1.120 and 0.900Â mmol Fe(II)/mg extract. This shows that the hexane extract of the roots of 
 <italic>O. cufodontii</italic> exhibited the maximum reducing power. Because the root extract of 
 <italic>O. cufodontii</italic> possesses antioxidant activity, it can be vital to human health.
