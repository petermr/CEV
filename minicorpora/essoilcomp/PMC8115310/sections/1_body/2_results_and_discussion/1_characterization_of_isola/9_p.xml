<p id="Par26">Compound 
 <bold>5</bold> (23 mg) was isolated as a white powder from the ethyl acetate extract of the root of 
 <italic>O. cufodontii</italic>. The UV–Vis spectrum showed absorption band at 340 nm indicating the presence of conjugated chromphore in the compound. The 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectrum (CDCl
 <sub>3</sub>, 400 MHz) revealed the presence of the three aromatic protons at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 7.90 (1H), 
 <italic>δ</italic> 7.75 (1H), and 7.63 (1H). The spectrum showed the presence of a methoxy group at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 3.85 (3H, 
 <italic>s</italic>). The signal observed at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 3.41 (1H, m) is due to the proton on carbon bearing oxygen
 <italic>.</italic> The 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectrum (CDCl
 <sub>3</sub>, 100 MHz) show 21 carbon signals which are in agreement with the number of carbon atoms in this compound. The signals due to aromatic protons were evident at 148.4, 145.8, 139.9, 135.9, 124.5, and 116.0. The signals due to methoxy group and an oxygenated aliphatic carbon were observed at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 61.9 and 77.2, respectively. The spectrum also showed signals in the aliphatic regions at
 <italic> δ</italic> 14.1, 22.2, 23.4, 23.6, 27.2, 29.7, 30.71, 30.72, 30.73, 38.4, 38.9, 41.8, and 44.0. The data generated led us to the identification of compound 5 as a known compound whose structure is depicted in Fig.
