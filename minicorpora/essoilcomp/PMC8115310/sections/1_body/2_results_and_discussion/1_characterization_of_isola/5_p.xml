<p id="Par22">The structure of compound 
 <bold>3</bold> was further confirmed using 2D NMR. The COSY spectrum clearly indicates a correlation between the proton at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 7.04 and 
 <italic>δ</italic> 7.34. Also observed correlation in the COSY spectrum is the proton at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 2.98 with 1.12 (H-5′ with H-6′, 7′) and 
 <italic>δ</italic> 2.67 with 1.08 (H-4″ with H-5″, 6″). The HSQC spectrum showed the proton signals at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 7.34, 7.07, 7.04, 3.19, 2.98, 2.70, 2.67, 2.30, 1.12 and 1.08 correlate with the carbon signals at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 137.0, 140.1, 128.5, 24.9, 26.9, 40.7, 38.5, 19.7, 21.4 and 18.2, respectively. In the HMBC spectrum, the proton signal at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 1.08 correlates with the carbon 
 <italic>δ</italic> 40.7, 213.6 and 24.9. The signal at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 2.7 correlates with the carbon signals at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 24.9 and 213.6 (Fragment 1). The spectrum also revealed a correlation between the proton at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 1.12 with the carbon at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 26 and 181 (Fragment 2). While the proton at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 2.98 correlates with the carbon at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 181.0.
