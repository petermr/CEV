 <italic>δ</italic> 4.64/4.51 (2H, 
 <italic>d</italic>, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 2.0, H-29) which together with an allylic methyl at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 1.61 (3H, 
 <italic>s</italic>, Me) indicated an isopropenyl function. The spectrum also showed signals for five tertiary methyl groups at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 1.18, 0.74, 0.67, 0.87 and 0.67, one isopropenyl moiety at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 1.61, 4.51 and 4.64, indicating a lupane-type skeleton. The signals at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 1.18 (3H, 
 <italic>s</italic>) and 
 <italic>δ</italic> 0.74 (3H,
