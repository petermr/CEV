 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, the DPPH radical scavenging activities of the isolated compounds are inferior compared with the activity shown by extracts. This is likely ascribed to the presence of phenols and flavonoids in the extracts of the roots and leaves of 
 <italic>O. cufodontii.</italic> The presence of flavonoids was further confirmed by the formation of yellow orange color on treating the extracts of the roots and leaves of 
 <italic>O. cufodontii</italic> with NaOH followed by HCl
