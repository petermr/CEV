 </sup>. The extracts and isolated compounds from the leaves and roots of 
 <italic>O. cufodontii</italic> change the purple colored DPPH radical to the yellow-colored diphenylpicrylhydrazicine. The extracts also reduce the absorbance of the DPPH radical at 517 nm indicating their potential as radical scavengers. The activity increases in a dose dependent manner. The hexane extract of the roots of 
 <italic>O. cufodontii</italic> reduced the DPPH radical by 90.50% at 200 µg/mL (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). This is superior to the activity displayed by the other extracts. This is evident from the low IC
 <sub>50</sub> (4.4 µg/mL) value observed for the hexane extract while the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of the hexane extract of the leaves, the EtOAc extract of the leaves and the roots were 6.0, 48 and 122 µg/mL, respectively. This is in agreement with the high radical scavenging activity reported in the literature for the hexane extracts of various non-pungent peppers compared with the EtOAc and methanol extracts

 </sup>. Ascorbic acid and quercetin used as positive control scavenged the DPPH radical by 93.02 and 89.01% at 100 µg/mL, respectively while their corresponding IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were 3.45 and 4.41 µg/mL. The result was comparable to the activity displayed by the hexane extract of the roots of 
 <italic>O. cufodontii.</italic> Literature reports have shown that 
 <italic>O. gratissimum, O. americanum, O. minimum</italic> and 
 <italic>O. citriodorum</italic> had radical scavenging activity of 81.1, 77.4, 70.1 and 60.6%, respectively
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup>. This indicates that the activity displayed by the hexane extract of the roots of 
 <italic>O. cufodontii</italic> is superior than the radical scavenging properties of its sister species.
