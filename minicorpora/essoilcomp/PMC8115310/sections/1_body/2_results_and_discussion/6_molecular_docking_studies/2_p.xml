<p id="Par37">The extracted natural product molecules 
 <bold>1–5</bold> showed better docking efficiency with DNA gyrase B within the binding pocket. In comparison to ciprofloxacin, all the isolated compounds have shown similar residual amino acids binding interactions with Ala-47, Glu-50, Gly-77, Ile-78, Pro-79, Ile-94, Thr-165 (Hydrophobic) and Asp-73, Arg-76, Asn-46 (Hydrogen bonds). The, isolated compound 
 <bold>1</bold> forms additional residual interaction with Val-120 in the active site of the target protein with the docking score − 6.3 kcal/mol. Compound 
 <bold>2</bold> has the docking score − 6.1 kcal/mol with no hydrogen bond or additional residual interactions within the binding pocket. The compounds 
 <bold>3</bold> and 
 <bold>4</bold> each formed additional residual Van dar Waals interaction with residual amino acids Val-43 and Val-167. Compound 
 <bold>3</bold> with docking score − 6.9 kcal/mol has two hydrogen bonds (Asn-46, Arg-76) and similar residual amino acid interaction within the binding pocket like standard inhibitor Ciprofloxacin. The compounds 
 <bold>4</bold> and 
 <bold>5</bold> both have docking score of − 6.6 kcal/mol and forms one hydrogen bond with Asn-46 and Asp-73, respectively. The Molecular docking study of these compounds displayed moderate (− 6.1) to better (− 6.9) docking score within binding pocket toward 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA gyrase B (6F86). Overall, in silico molecular docking analysis of the isolated compounds matches with in vitro analysis against 
 <italic>S. aureus.</italic> Among compounds analyzed, compound 
 <bold>3</bold> shown comparable residual interactions and docking score of ciprofloxacin. Hence, compound 
 <bold>3</bold> have a better antibacterial agent than the other isolated compounds in this investigation. The binding affinity, H-bonds, and residual amino acid interactions of the five compounds are summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref> and their binding interactions are shown in Figs.
