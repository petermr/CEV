<p id="Par38">In conclusion, two novel compounds 
 <bold>3</bold> and 
 <bold>4</bold> have been isolated and characterized from the roots extracts of 
 <italic>O. cufodontii</italic>. The 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extracts of the roots, the essential oil of the leaves of 
 <italic>O. cufodontii,</italic> and compound 
 <bold>4</bold> have shown comparable results to ciprofloxacin. The radical scavenging activity and anti-lipid peroxidation potential displayed by the 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extracts of the roots of 
 <italic>O. cufodontii</italic> also suggests the potential of the plant as an antioxidant. The in silico molecular docking studies revealed that all the isolated compounds 
 <bold>1â€“5</bold> have close binding energy to the standard drug and may be considered as a good inhibitor of DNA gyrase. Hence, the activity displayed herein indicates that the plant has a great potential as a remedy for diseases caused by bacteria and radicals. Furthermore, the results obtained in the present study may help substantiate the traditional use of the roots of 
 <italic>O. cufodontii</italic> with modern scientific based medical treatment.
