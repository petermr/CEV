<p>It can be concluded that matK possesses a good DNA barcode for Clauseneae, especially with regard to the discrimination of 
 <italic>Murraya koenigii</italic> from 
 <italic>Clausena excavata</italic> and 
 <italic>C. harmandiana</italic>. This is due to its ease of amplification and sequence variation. However, a combination with other DNA fragments would increase its degree of identification efficiency. Notably, the extracts obtained from 
 <italic>Clausena excavata</italic>, 
 <italic>C. harmandiana</italic> and 
 <italic>Murraya koenigii</italic> were found to be effective as natural antioxidant, antidiabetic and antihypertension agents and were also found to inhibit human lung cancer cells without any side effects on human normal cells. Moreover, the methanol extract of 
 <italic>M. koenigii</italic> exhibited the strongest degree of biological activities because it possessed the highest amount of containable phenolic compounds and flavonoids. Suggesting that the extracts of the three Clauseneae plants could be promising candidates as natural bioactive agents in various relevant fields, which the biological activities in animal models could be initially studied.
