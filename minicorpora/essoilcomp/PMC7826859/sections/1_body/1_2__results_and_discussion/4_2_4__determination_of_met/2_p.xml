<p>The results revealed that the essential oil and methanol extracts of 
 <italic>C. excavata</italic>, 
 <italic>C. harmandiana</italic> and 
 <italic>M. koenigii</italic> did not have any toxic effect on PBMC at a concentration of 1 µg/mL relating to the increasing number of cell viability after being tested over 24 h and 48 h (data not shown). For A549 cells assessment, the essential oil and methanol extracts of 
 <italic>C. excavata</italic>, 
 <italic>C. harmandiana</italic> and 
 <italic>M. koenigii</italic> could effectively decrease cell viability when concentrations were increased to 1 µg/mL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00117-f004">Figure 4</xref>). This was especially true for 
 <italic>M. koenigii</italic> in the methanol extract, which displayed high efficacy activity against A549 cells at almost 80% after 24 h and 90% over 48 h. The study conducted by Huang et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-plants-10-00117" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] determined that carbazole alkaloids and coumarins obtained from 
 <italic>Clausena</italic> plants exhibited anticancer activity. Based on the finding of our study, all the Clauseneae plant extracts exhibited high activity against human lung cancer cells. This was especially true of the methanol extract of 
 <italic>M. koenigii</italic> that displayed high potential activity against A549 cells when compared with the methanol leaves and stem extracts of Marsdenia glabra Cost. In turn, this extract displayed low inhibitory activity within a range of about 15–25% at 1000 µg/mL [

 <xref rid="B45-plants-10-00117" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] revealed that the extract of 
 <italic>M. koenigii</italic> displayed a high degree of potential anticancer activity in experimental animal trials.
