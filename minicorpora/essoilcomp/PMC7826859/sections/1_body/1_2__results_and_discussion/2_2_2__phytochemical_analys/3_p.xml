<p>Furthermore, 
 <italic>α-</italic>Pinene (13.5–35.7%) and/or 
 <italic>β-</italic>Phellandrene (14.7–50.2%) were identified as the major components of the specimen collected from seven other locations. Additionally, (E)-Caryophyllene (26.5%–31.5%) and 
 <italic>α-</italic>Selinene (9.5%–10.4%) were considered the principal components of the essential oils derived from the specimens collected from two locations. The chemical compositions of the essential oil of two Chemotypes of 
 <italic>M. koenigii</italic> collected from northern India were assessed in different seasons. Chemotype A contained the major compounds of 
 <italic>α-</italic>Pinene (34.6–41.9%), Sab-inene (26.1–36.1%), (E)-Caryophyllene (2.4–5.4%) and Terpinen-4-ol (1.5–5.3%), while chemotype B contained 
 <italic>α-</italic>Pinene (52.7–65.3%), 
 <italic>β-</italic>Pinene (10.7–12.9%), (E)-Caryophyllene (3.1–10.3%) and Limonene (5.1–5.7%) [

 <italic>M. koenigii</italic> leaves collected from southern India, namely Linalool (32.83%), Elemol (7.44%), Geranyl acetate (6.18%), Myrcene (6.12%), Allo-Ocimene (5.02%), 
 <italic>α-</italic>Terpinene (4.9%), (E)-
 <italic>β-</italic>Ocimene (3.68%) and Neryl acetate (3.45%), were also identified [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-10-00117" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Notably, Tripathi et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-10-00117" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] established that 3-Carene (18.52%), 
 <italic>β-</italic>Pinene (13.57%), 
 <italic>α-</italic>Pinene (9.38%), Linalool (5.42%), 
 <italic>α-</italic>Eudesmol (4.55%), ρ-Cymene (3.61%), 
 <italic>γ-</italic>Terpinene (3.48%), 
 <italic>α-</italic>Amorphene (3.38%), Allo-Ocimene (2.75%), Sabinene (2.55%), 
 <italic>γ-</italic>Terpinene (2.48%), Linalyl acetate (2.46%), Myrcene (2.43%) and 
 <italic>β-</italic>Eudesmol (2.16%) were the crucial constituents of the essential oil of 
 <italic>M. koenigii</italic> collected from Uttarakhand, India. Hence, variations in the compositions of the essential oils of curry leaves were found to be dependent upon season and the specific location of collection.
