<p>As determined by the results, anethole was identified as a major phytochemical compound of 
 <italic>C. excavata</italic> and 
 <italic>C. harmandiana</italic>. Additionally, minor compounds were observed to be present, namely Camphene (9.61%), 
 <italic>β-</italic>Terpinene (7.87%), D-Limonene (7.07%), 
 <italic>β-</italic>Mycene (3.69%), 
 <italic>γ-</italic>Terpinene (3.57%), 4-Terpinenol (3.34%) and others, of which less than 3% were found in the essential oils. Cheng et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-10-00117" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] reported that the essential oil obtained from the fresh leaves of 
 <italic>C. excavata</italic> contained Safrole (75.85%) and Terpinolene (17.86%) as the primary components, while Trung et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-plants-10-00117" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] discovered that 
 <italic>β-</italic>Caryophyllene (16.7%), Spathulenol (11.9%) and Bicyclogermacrene (7.5%) were the major constituents of the 
 <italic>C. excavata</italic> plant collected in Vietnam. On the other hand, Arbab et al. [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-10-00117" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] revealed that 
 <italic>α-</italic>Pinene (12.23%) and Copaene (12.40%) were the major constituents present in the essential oil of 
 <italic>C. harmandiana</italic>. Moreover, bioactive Carbazoles and Coumarins were observed as the major constituents of 
 <italic>C. excavata</italic> and 
 <italic>C. harmandiana</italic>, of which these two compounds were identified as bioactive compounds [

 <xref rid="B26-plants-10-00117" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. According to the results of the assessment of the essential oil of 
 <italic>M. koenigii</italic>, it was found to possess Anethole (26.02%), Caryophyllene (21.15%) and 
 <italic>α-</italic>Pinene (12.23%) as the major components. These results are in accordance with those presented in the published report of Sukkaew et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-10-00117" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], wherein the essential oil obtained from the fresh leaves of 
 <italic>M. koenigii</italic> collected from Surat Thani Province, Thailand, was found to contain 
 <italic>β-</italic>Caryophyllene (21.4%), 
 <italic>α-</italic>Selinene (10.2%) and 
 <italic>α-</italic>Humulene (7.1%) and 
 <italic>α-</italic>Pinene (4.4%) as its major components. However, in this study, the chemical composition of the essential oil of 
 <italic>M. koenigii</italic> was distinctly different from that of previous studies. The composition of the essential oils of the fresh leaves of 
 <italic>M. koenigii</italic> that was cultivated at six locations in Peninsula Malaysia and Borneo revealed that the two major volatile metabolites were identified as 
 <italic>β-</italic>Caryophyllene (16.6–26.6%) and 
 <italic>α-</italic>Humulene (15.2–26.7%). The volatile substances could be categorized as sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated sesquiterpenes as the major groups along with oxygenated monoterpenes and oxygenated diterpenes [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-10-00117" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], Caryophyllene (9.5%), 
 <italic>β-</italic>Myrcene (3.2%), 
 <italic>α-</italic>Caryophyllene (2.8%), 4-Terpineol (2.8%), 
 <italic>g</italic>-Terpinene (2.7%) and Allyl (methoxy) dimethylsilane (2.6%) [
 <xref rid="B29-plants-10-00117" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Rao et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-10-00117" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] stated that the essential oil obtained from wild and cultivated 
 <italic>M. koenigii</italic> leaves collected from ten Indian locations revealed different chemical compositions. For the essential oil of the wild plants, 
 <italic>α-</italic>Pinene (55.7%) and 
 <italic>β-</italic>Pinene (10.6%) were detected as the dominant constituents.
