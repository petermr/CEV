<p>Furthermore, their relevant molecular traits were assessed to identify all plant specimens. Herein, we have established the DNA barcoding sequences (
 <italic>mat</italic>K and 
 <italic>rbc</italic>L) of these three species of plants to be in the tribe Clauseneae. All obtained sequences were verified by their accession numbers (
 <italic>mat</italic>K; MH187239- MH187243 and 
 <italic>rbc</italic>L; MH187222- MH187229) and compared to the sequences previously deposited in Genbank using BLAST. Regarding molecular identification, genomic DNA was successfully extracted from every specimen. Two main chloroplast 
 <italic>mat</italic>K and 
 <italic>rbc</italic>L genes were employed for the purposes of DNA barcoding. Upon PCR amplification, fragments encompassing both 
 <italic>mat</italic>K and 
 <italic>rbc</italic>L were distinguished by approximately 700 base pairs. The success rates of PCR amplification of 
 <italic>mat</italic>K and 
 <italic>rbc</italic>L were 62.5% and 100%, respectively. Regions of similarity between the sequences were observed via the BLAST program. It was determined that these were similar to those of the 
 <italic>Clausena</italic>e specimens previously deposited in Genbank at a 99â€“100% degree of accuracy. Based on 
 <italic>mat</italic>K DNA sequences, five samples of Clauseneae (PSRU_RUT001-PSRU_RUT002, PSRU_RUT003-PSRU_RUT004 and PSRU_RUT005) were found to be closely related to 
 <italic>Murraya koenigii</italic> (L.) Spreng, 
 <italic>Clausena excavata</italic> Burm.f. and 
 <italic>Clausena harmandiana</italic> (Pierre) Pierre ex Guillaumin, respectively. Furthermore, eight 
 <italic>rbc</italic>L sequences revealed a close resemblance to 
 <italic>M. koenigii</italic> (L.) Spreng (PSRU_RUT001-PSRU_RUT002), 
 <italic>C. excavata</italic> Burm.f. (PSRU_RUT003-PSRU_RUT004) and 
 <italic>C. harmandiana</italic> (Pierre) Pierre ex Guillaumin (PSRU_RUT005-PSRU_RUT008). Nevertheless, some 
 <italic>rbc</italic>L sequences were observed to be similar to the sequences previously deposited in Genbank, namely 
 <italic>M. koenigii</italic> (99.58%, complete genome), 
 <italic>M. paniculate</italic> (99.58%, complete genome) and 
 <italic>Micromelum minutum</italic> (99.44%, complete genome) etc. This set of circumstances resulted in a number of difficulties with regard to establishing the correct species name. Therefore, representative specimens obtained from the 
 <italic>mat</italic>K DNA sequences [PSRU-RUT001 (MH187239), PSRU-RUT003 (MH187241) and PSRU-RUT005 (MH187243)] and a relevant outgroup were further assessed by phylogenic analysis using the maximum likelihood (ML) method with 1000 bootstrap replicates. The phylogenic construction revealed that each representative plant species was reciprocally monophyletic as depicted in
