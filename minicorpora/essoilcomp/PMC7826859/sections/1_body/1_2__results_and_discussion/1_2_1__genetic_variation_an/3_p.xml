<p>In the past decade, DNA barcoding inferred from nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence was employed for the discrimination of 
 <italic>M. koenigii</italic>. It was suggested that the ITS sequence was an appropriate molecular marker for isolation of 
 <italic>M. koenigii</italic> from selected plants [
 <xref rid="B5-plants-10-00117" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. At this time, the 
 <italic>mat</italic>K gene was determined to be more reliable when applied as a DNA barcode for the identification of the designated three plant species in the tribe Clauseneae. It was noted that the 
 <italic>rbc</italic>L sequences were inconsistent with the basic principles of DNA barcoding because of certain drawbacks, for instance low rates of variation and amplification, poor universality of the primer, gene deletion and a potential number of other issues as has been postulated by Shivakumar et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-10-00117" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Although 
 <italic>mat</italic>K had a higher discriminatory power than 
 <italic>rbc</italic>L, it was more difficult to amplify it across distantly related species [
 <xref rid="B18-plants-10-00117" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In the same manner, this result conformed to those of previous studies conducted by Penjor et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-10-00117" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] who established the phylogenetic relationships of citrus plants and their relatives inferred from 
 <italic>mat</italic>K gene sequences. It was found that use of 
 <italic>mat</italic>K as a marker alone could establish the curry tree as 
 <italic>M. koenigii</italic>. A combination of both markers, 
 <italic>mat</italic>K + 
 <italic>rbc</italic>L, could help to discriminate between a maximum number of species. However, a number of researchers have used the integration of the DNA barcode to classify and identify species, while several different combinations of DNA barcodes have been effectively put forward for different plants [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-10-00117" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. To attain a maximum discrimination rate among closely related species, a combination of Internal Transcribed Spacers (ITS + 
 <italic>mat</italic>K + 
 <italic>rbc</italic>L) has been suggested by Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-10-00117" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].
