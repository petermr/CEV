<p>Botanically, three plant species in the Clauseneae tribe have been recognized as a type of strongly fragrant evergreen trees with a tall slender shape of approximately 10 m tall, and odd-pinnate narrow leaves positioned in around 10â€“15 pairs separated to slanting leaf-lets that are 3.5 to 7 cm long. All materials were morphologically confirmed by an expert botanist by using the Forest Trees of Southern Thailand [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-10-00117" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It was determined that the specific collected materials labeled with voucher numbers PSRU-RUT001-PSRU-RUT002 could not be identified by species. However, voucher numbers PSRU-RUT003-PSRU-RUT004 and PSRU-RUT005-PSRU-RUT006 could be identified as 
 <italic>Clausena excavata</italic> and 
 <italic>C. harmandiana</italic>, respectively. The details of the morphological features of each representative Claseneae tree are presented in
