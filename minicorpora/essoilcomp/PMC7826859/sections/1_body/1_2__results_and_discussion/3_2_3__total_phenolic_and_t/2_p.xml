<p>Antioxidant activity of the essential oils and methanol extracts of three Clauseneae plants were measured by DPPH, ABTS and FRAP assays. In terms of establishing potential antioxidant activities, the DPPH free radical scavenging ability is usually employed as the preferred method. In this situation, the antioxidant compounds in the plant extracts donate an electron or hydrogen radical to an unstable DPPH free radical and then become a stable diamagnetic molecule [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-10-00117" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In this study, the DPPH free radical scavenging activity of the three Clauseneae plant extracts were expressed as IC
 <sub>50</sub> (µg/mL). The DPPH radical scavenging activities of 
 <italic>C. excavata</italic>, 
 <italic>C. harmandiana</italic> and 
 <italic>M. koenigii</italic> in the methanol extracts and essential oils were observed and are presented in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00117-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Specifically, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranged from 95.54 µg/mL to 2865.26 µg/mL. Furthermore, it was revealed that 
 <italic>M. koenigii</italic> in the methanol extract displayed the highest radical scavenging activity at 95.54 µg/mL followed by 
 <italic>M. koenigii</italic> in essential oil (167.74 µg/mL), 
 <italic>C. excavata</italic> in methanol extract (904.53 µg/mL), 
 <italic>C. harmandiana</italic> in methanol extract (2037.66 µg/mL), 
 <italic>C. excavata</italic> in essential oil (2059.29 µg/mL) and 
 <italic>C. harmandiana</italic> in essential oil (2865.26 µg/mL). There was a strong correlation between the DPPH free radical scavenging activity in terms of the total phenolic (r = 0.810, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and total flavonoid (r = 0.835, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) contents of all plant extracts. Furthermore, the antioxidant capacities of the essential oil and methanol extracts of the three Clauseneae plants were investigated through the scavenging activity of the ABTS cation free radicals. With regard to the mechanism of this assay, the antioxidant compounds donated an electron and hydrogen atom to an unstable ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> cation radical, which could then convert to a stable ABTS radical form and then be used to evaluate the degree of antioxidant activity by reduction of the bluegreen ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> radical. The ABTS free radical scavenging ability of various extracts of the Clauseneae plant extracts was expressed as mg GAE/g extract. The ABTS cation scavenging activity of the methanol extract of 
 <italic>M. koenigii</italic> was found to be significantly higher than the other extracts (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) at a value of 118.12 mg GAE/g extract, followed by the methanol extracts of 
 <italic>C. excavata</italic> (88.65 mg GAE/g extract) and 
 <italic>C. harmandiana</italic> (80.11 mg GAE/g extract).
