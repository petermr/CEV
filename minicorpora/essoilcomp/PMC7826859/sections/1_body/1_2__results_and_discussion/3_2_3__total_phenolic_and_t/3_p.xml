<p>Furthermore, the essential oil of all plants displayed less scavenging activity of the ABTS cation radical than the methanol extracts, with the exception of the essential oil extract of 
 <italic>M. koenigii</italic> which possessed a degree of high ABTS cation radical that was close to that of the methanol extract of 
 <italic>C. harmandiana</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Importantly, a high correlation between ABTS cation free radical scavenging activity with total phenolic (r = 0.881, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and total flavonoid (r = 0.880, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) contents of all plant extracts was observed. Additionally, the antioxidant activity of Clauseneae plant extracts was investigated by ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay based on the measurement of the ability of antioxidants to reduce ferric iron (Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>) to its ferrous (Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>) form. The potential antioxidant activity was then measured through its reducing ca-pacity. The FRAP values of the extracts were expressed as mg GAE/g extract. The highest FRAP value was found in the methanol extract of 
 <italic>M. koenigii</italic> (48.15 mg GAE/g extract) (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), while the essential oil of 
 <italic>C. excavata</italic> displayed a minimum degree of antioxidant activity at 5.07 mg GAE/g extract. Additionally, a high correlation was observed between their FRAP values and their total phenolic (r = 0.823, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and total flavonoid (r = 0.875, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) contents. It was further observed that the methanol extract of 
 <italic>M. koenigii</italic> showed strong DPPH free radical scavenging activity, the highest degree of ABTS free radical scavenging ability, and also exhibited high reducing power. All of which indicated that the methanol extract of 
 <italic>M. koenigii</italic> has the potential to scavenge both neutral and cation free radicals. Moreover, a significant correlation between chemical constituents and antioxidant activity suggests that the phenolic and flavonoid contents of Clauseneae plants extracts are associated with their strong antioxidant activities. In addition, the antioxidant activities of the extracts may be a result of the level of terpene contained in the extract. A previous study conducted by Ma et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-10-00117" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] revealed that the alkenes isolated from 
 <italic>M. koenigii</italic> exhibited significant antioxidant activities using DPPH free radical scavenging assay. The study conducted by Truong et al. [
 <xref rid="B36-plants-10-00117" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] reported that the methanol extract of 
 <italic>Severinia buxifolia</italic>, belonging to the Rutaceae family, showed the highest extraction yield along with the highest content of phenolics, flavonoids, alkaloids and terpenoids. Moreover, the methanol extract also possessed the highest degree of antioxidant activity indexed by the DPPH free radical scavenging assay and the highest in vitro anti-inflammatory activity. Similarly, Albaayit et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-plants-10-00117" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] speculated that the extract of the methanol leaves of 
 <italic>C. excavata</italic> displayed the highest phenolic content and antioxidant activity based on FRAP and DPPH radical scavenging activity assays. These finding support the contention that methanol is the optimal solvent for the extraction of Rutaceae plants.
