<p>Furthermore, the inhibition of 
 <italic>α-</italic>glucosidase, an important enzyme that hydrolyses oligosaccharides, can reduce the risk of diabetes and obesity. Based on our results, the high potential of 
 <italic>α-</italic>glucosidase inhibitory activity observed in the methanol extract of 
 <italic>M. koenigii</italic> could be related to its high total phenolic and total flavonoid contents. This would be indicative of strong relative correlations of 0.792 and 0.804 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). These results are supported by the findings of Nagarani et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-10-00117" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], which suggested that the 
 <italic>α-</italic>glucosidase inhibitory activity of natural substances was strongly correlated with the contents of the flavonoid and phenolic compounds. Moreover, antihypertensive inhibitory activity was investigated and the percentage ranged from 31.07% to 84.95% (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00117-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The methanol extract of 
 <italic>M. koenigii</italic> recorded the highest value at 84.95%. These results revealed a strong correlation r = 0.704 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and r = 0.727 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) between the antihypertensive inhibitory activity of all plant extracts and their total phenolic and total flavonoid contents, respectively. Moreover, the high potential of the antihypertensive (&gt;80%) properties of plants has been reported in various plant species such as 
 <italic>Quercus infectoria</italic> (Fagaceae) (93.9%), 
 <italic>Berberis integerrima</italic> (Berberidaceae) (88.2%), 
 <italic>Crataegus microphylla</italic> (Rosaceae) (80.9%) and 
 <italic>Onopordon acanthium</italic> (Asteraceae) (80.2%) [
