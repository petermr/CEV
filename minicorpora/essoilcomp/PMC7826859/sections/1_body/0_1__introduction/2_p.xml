<p>Over the last decades, molecular technique based on DNA sequence can be applied to the systematic identification of known and unknown plants and animals. DNA barcoding, a modern method for the rapid identification of any species, is considered as a molecular and bioinformatics tool for species differentiation, identification and discovery of new species at molecular systematic level [
