 <italic>Clausena excavata</italic>, 
 <italic>C. harmandiana</italic> and 
 <italic>Murraya koenigii</italic> gathered from Chiang Mai, Thailand using the DNA barcoding sequences obtained from two candidates of barcoding loci (
 <italic>mat</italic>K and 
 <italic>rbc</italic>L). In addition, phytochemical screening and an assessment of the biological properties of these Clauseneae plants were also carried out.
