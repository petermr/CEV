<p>The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to investigate the cytotoxicity of the three Clauseneae plants extracts on A549 and human lymphocyte cells. Tumor cells (A549) and human lymphocyte cells were cultured in a 96-well tissue culture plate, which contained 5000 and 10,000 cells, in each well, respectively. Different concentrations of the sample solution were added to each well and they were then incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator for 24 h. After that, 20 µL of MTT solution (5 mg/mL of MTT in PBS, pH 7.4) was added and the specimens were further incubated at 37 °C for another 4 h. Cell medium was drained out and the formazan dye sediment was dissolved with 100 µL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Absorbance was measured at 540 nm and the cell viability ratio was calculated by comparing the absorbance of the wells that did not contain any sample solution.
