<p>Antitumor activity and cell toxicity assay of the extracts were determined according to the protocol of Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B60-plants-10-00117" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] with some modifications. Tumor cells, A549, were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) until reaching 80% con-fluence. Trypan blue exclusion method was applied to determine the cell viability. In this experiment, optimum cell viability was above 98% and concentration level was adjusted for further experimentation. Human lymphocyte cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), were obtained from healthy volunteers by venipuncture and heparin was used as an anticoagulant. The blood solution was diluted with one-fold sterile phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and was centrifuged with Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation to separate PBMCs from the other specimens. Briefly, the diluted blood solution was overlaid in Ficoll-Hypaque solution and centrifuged at 1300 rpm, 25 °C for 30 min. The PBMC layer was collected, washed two times with sterile PBS and the redissolved PBMC pellets were treated with RPMI-1640 cell medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cell viability was determined. and the concentration level was adjusted for further experiment.
