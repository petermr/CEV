 <italic>α-</italic>Glucosidase (AGH) solution was prepared from rat intestinal acetone powder by partial modification of the procedure reported by Oki et al. [
 <xref rid="B57-plants-10-00117" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. 100 mg of intestinal acetone powder (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co.; St. Louis, MO, USA) was added to 3 mL of 0.9% NaCl solution, homogenized with the sonication and kept in an ice bath. After centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, the resulting supernatant was kept cold and directly subjected to inhibitory assay. The method of Adisakwattana et al. [
 <xref rid="B58-plants-10-00117" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] was used to determine AGH inhibitory assay. The assay was defined as the percent inhibition under the assay conditions, which was calculated according to the formula: 
 <list list-type="simple">
  <list-item>
   <p>Percent inhibition = (A
    <sub>o</sub> − A
    <sub>s</sub>/A
    <sub>o</sub>) × 100
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Where A
    <sub>o</sub> is the absorbance of the control, and A
    <sub>s</sub> is the absorbance of the mixture containing the test compound. The data were presented as the average of the triplicate analyses.
