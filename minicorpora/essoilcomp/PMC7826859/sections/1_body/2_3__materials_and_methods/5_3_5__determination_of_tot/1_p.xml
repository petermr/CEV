<p>The total flavonoid contents were determined by the method of Kaewnarin et al. [

 <sub>2</sub>. After 5 min, 0.15 mL of 100 g/L AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> was added. The reaction was mixed and incubated at ambient temperature for 15 min, and the absorbance was measured at 415 nm. Quercetin solution was used as a standard for the determination [
