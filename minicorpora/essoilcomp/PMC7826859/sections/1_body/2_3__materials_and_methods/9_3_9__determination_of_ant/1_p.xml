<p>The angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity was evaluated by the modified method of Park et al. [
 <xref rid="B59-plants-10-00117" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The sample (50 µL) was mixed with 50 µL of 25 mU/mL ACE (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co.; St. Louis, MO, USA) and pre-incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Then, 6 mM hippuryl-histidyl-leucine (HHL) in 50 mM Tris with 300 mM NaCl 100 µL was added and further incubated for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 200 µL of 1.0 M HCl. Hippuric acid was extracted by ethyl acetate (600 µL), followed by centrifugation at 4880 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant (200 µL) was transferred to a test tube and evaporated at 95 °C to remove the ethyl acetate. Hot distilled water (1.0 mL) was added to dissolve the hippuric acid and the absorbance was determined at 228 nm. The ACE inhibition was calculated from this equation:

   <p>Percent inhibition = [1 − (A

  <list-item>
   <p>Where A
    <sub>o</sub> is the absorbance of the control (containing all reagents except the test compound), and A
    <sub>s</sub> is the absorbance of the mixture containing the test compound. The results of all experiments were expressed as mean ± standard deviation.
