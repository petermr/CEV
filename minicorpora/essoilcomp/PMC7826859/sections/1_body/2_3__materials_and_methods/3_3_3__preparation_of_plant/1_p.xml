<p>The leaves of three plants of Clauseneae were dried at 50 °C for 72 h, grounded into small pieces and stored at room temperature. Plant materials (100 g) were individually extracted with 1000 mL of methanol (1:10) and left for 12 h at ambient temperature. The extracts were sonicated using an ultrasonicator (Crest, USA) for 30 min, filtered through Whatman no. 1 filter paper and evaporated under a vacuum at 40 °C using a rotary evaporator until dry. Dry extracts were kept at 4 °C in the dark for further study.</p>
