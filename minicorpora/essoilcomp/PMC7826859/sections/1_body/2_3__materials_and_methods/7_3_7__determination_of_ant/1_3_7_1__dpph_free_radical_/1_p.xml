<p>The free radical scavenging ability was determined according to the method of Gülçin et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-plants-10-00117" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] with slight modifications. The 2,2′-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH
 <sup>●</sup>) solution in ethanol (0.1 mM, 1.5 mL) was mixed with 0.5 mL of different concentrations of each extract, and methanol was used as the control. The mixtures were well shaken and kept at ambient temperature for 30 min in the dark. The absorbance was measured at 517 nm and gallic acid was used as the comparative standard. The percent of DPPH
 <sup>●</sup> discoloration of the samples was calculated according to the formula:
 <list list-type="simple">
  <list-item>
   <p>Percent inhibition = (A
    <sub>o</sub>- A
    <sub>s</sub>/A
    <sub>o</sub>) × 100
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Where A
    <sub>o</sub> is the absorbance of the control (containing all reagents except the test compound), and A
    <sub>s</sub> is the absorbance of the mixture containing the test compound. The test sample concentrations providing 50% inhibition (IC
    <sub>50</sub>) were calculated from the plot of inhibition percentage against extract concentration values. The radical scavenging ability was presented IC
    <sub>50</sub> values. The data were presented as the average of the triplicate analyses.
