<p>The FRAP assay was determined according to the protocol of Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B56-plants-10-00117" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] with some modifications. The FRAP reagent containing 10 mM of 2,4,6-tris(2-pyridyl)-s-triazine (TPTZ) solution in 40 mM hydrochloric acid (20 mL), 20 mM ferric (III) chloride (20 mL) and acetate buffer (5 mL, 300 mM, pH 3.6) was pre-pared freshly prior to being used. Different concentrations of each extract (0.1 mL) was mixed with the FRAP reagent (1.5 mL) and 1.4 mL of acetate buffer (300 mM, pH 3.6) and were then incubated at an ambient temperature for 30 min. The absorbance was measured at 593 nm. Gallic acid was used as a standard and FRAP value was calculated as mg GAE/g extract. The data were presented as the average of the triplicate analyses.
