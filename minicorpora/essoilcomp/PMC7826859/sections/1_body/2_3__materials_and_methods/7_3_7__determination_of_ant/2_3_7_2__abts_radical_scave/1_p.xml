<p>The ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup> scavenging activity was measured according to the method of Re et al. [
 <xref rid="B55-plants-10-00117" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] with some modification. The stock solution of ABTS cation chromophore was prepared by a reaction between a 7 mM ABTS solution (100 mL) and 2.45 mM potassium persulphate (final concentration) (100 mL) and was kept in a dark place at an ambient temperature for 16 h. The ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup> solution was diluted with phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) to an absorbance of 0.70 ± 002 at 734 nm. An aliquot of each extract (100 µL) was added to 3 mL of an ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup> solution, and the resulting mixture was then incubated for 30 min at an ambient temperature prior to measuring the absorbance at 734 nm. Gallic acid was used as a reference compound, and the ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup> scavenging activity was expressed as mg GAE/g extract. The data were presented as the average of the triplicate analyses.
