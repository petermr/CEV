<p>Phytochemical analysis of the essential oils was determined according to the previous research of Tanruean et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-plants-10-00117" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The extracts were analyzed for their phytochemicals using a gas chromatography (GC) 6890 Agilent Technologies/MSD 5973 Hewlett Packard, equipped with a MS detector and an HP-5MS capillary column (bonded and cross-linked 5% phenyl-methylpolysiloxane 30 × 0.25 µm, film thickness 0.25 µm). The injector and detector temperatures were set at 270 and 280 °C, respectively. The oven temperature was set at 80 °C and held for 2 min, and then increased at a rate 10 °C/min to 120 °C and held for 4 min. The oven temperature was then in-creased at a rate 10 °C/min to 155 °C and held for 4 min, and then increased at a rate 5 °C/min to 280 °C and held for 12.50 min. The total running time was 55 min. Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The sample (1 µL) was injected in the splitless mode. GC-MS detection of an electron ionization system with an ionization energy measurement of 70 eV was used. Injector and MS transfer line temperatures were set at 270 and 290 °C, respectively. The components were identified based on a comparison of their relative retention times and the mass spectra with W8N08 and Wiley7n libraries data of the GC-MS system.
