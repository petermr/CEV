<p>We amplified and sequenced the chloroplast DNA regions (
 <italic>mat</italic>K and 
 <italic>rbc</italic>L) based on primers 1) 
 <italic>mat</italic>K (
 <italic>mat</italic>K-F; 5′-TAA TTT ACG ATC AAT TCA TTC-3′ and 
 <italic>mat</italic>K-R; 5′-TCT GGA GTC TTT CTT GAG CG-3′) and 2) 
 <italic>rbc</italic>L (
 <italic>rbc</italic>L-F; 5′-TCA CCA CAA ACA GAA ACT AAA GC-3′ and 
 <italic>rbcL</italic>-R; 5′-GGC ACA AAA TAA GAA ACG ATC TC-3′). PCR was conducted in a final reaction volume of 20 μL made up of 5× PCR Enhancer, 2 μL of 10× HF Reaction Buffer, 0.4 μL of 10 mM dNTP Mix, 0.3 μL each of the forward and reverse primers (10 μmol/L), 0.3 μL of Long and High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (0.75 U) (biotechrabbit, Germany), 10.7 μL of nuclear free water and at least 20 ng of the DNA template. PCR amplification was performed using a T100
 <sup>TM</sup> Thermal Cycler (BioRad, USA). The thermal profile used was: 94 °C for 3 min, 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 48 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 10 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products were verified on 1% agarose gels stained with Redsafe
 <sup>TM</sup> under UV light and were then purified using GenUP PCR/Gel Cleanup Kit (Biotechrabbit, Germany). Afterwards, the purified product was direct sequenced with forward and reverse primers by Macrogen, Inc (
