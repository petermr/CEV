<p>A similarity search for each sequence was verified using BLAST (

 <xref rid="B46-plants-10-00117" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] were used to create phylogenetic trees. The reliability of each branch was tested by bootstrap analysis with 1000 replications. Clade with bootstrap values of 70% was considered significantly supported [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-10-00117" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The sequences of 
 <italic>Merrillia caloxyon</italic> were used as an outgroup. All DNA sequences were finally trimmed to 718 (
 <italic>mat</italic>K) and 713 (
 <italic>rbc</italic>L) base pairs. The sequences obtained after removing the primers used for PCR amplification were deposited to NCBI-Genbank BankIt (
 <uri xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BankIt/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BankIt/</uri>) under accession numbers (
