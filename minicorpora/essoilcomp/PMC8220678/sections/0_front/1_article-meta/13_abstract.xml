  <title>Background</title>
  <p id="Par1">The tick 
   <italic>Haemaphysalis longicornis</italic> (Neumann) is a well-known vector of numerous pathogens of veterinary and medical importance. Various control strategies, including the use of synthetic pesticides, have been developed to control this tick species. However, demand for effective and safe alternative pesticides is increasing due to the adverse effects associated with the intensive and injudicious use of synthetic pesticides, which include undesirable effects on non-target species and environmental pollution. Hence, the acaricidal activity of the extract and the essential oil of 
   <italic>Cinnamomum cassia</italic> (Chinese cinnamon) and their major components, and the underlying mechanisms of this activity, were evaluated against unfed larvae and nymphs of 
   <italic>H</italic>.

  <p id="Par2">The components of the extract and essential oil of 
   <italic>C. cassia</italic> were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and their larvicidal and nymphicidal activity were evaluated using the larval and nymphal packet test. The underlying detoxification mechanism was elucidated by targeting
   <italic> in vivo</italic> esterase and monooxygenase activity, and the toxicological effect was assessed on non-target 
   <italic>Tenebrio molitor</italic> and 
   <italic>Harmonia axyridis</italic> by topical application in open Petri dishes.
