<p id="Par20">The presence of (
 <italic>E</italic>)-cinnamaldehyde as the predominant component in the extract and essential oil from 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>cassia</italic> bark in the present study is in accordance with results reported in other studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, the chemical composition of the extract and essential oil from 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>cassia</italic> bark is affected by many factors including methods of extraction, and the different agroecological conditions during the growth and development of the plant [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. As a result, several species of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>cassia</italic> have been reported with different percent contents of (
 <italic>E</italic>)-cinnamaldehyde [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. For example, in the study of Deng et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], (
 <italic>E</italic>)-cinnamaldehyde was the predominant component and accounted for about 72.23% of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>cassia</italic> bark essential oil. In a recent study, Liang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] found that (
 <italic>E</italic>)-cinnamaldehyde (62.96%) was a major component of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>cassia</italic> bark extract. In addition, in other species of 
 <italic>Cinnamomum</italic>, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-cinnamaldehyde is also a major component, and accounted for about 66.43% of 
 <italic>Cinnamomum</italic>
 <italic>zeylanicum</italic> bark essential oil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In the present study, the percent content of (
 <italic>E</italic>)-cinnamaldehyde in the essential oil (89.95%) was higher than in the extract (50.79%). A possible explanation for variation in the percent content of (
 <italic>E</italic>)-cinnamaldehyde may be the different methods used for the extraction of the extract and essential oil. Variation in the percent content of (
 <italic>E</italic>)-cinnamaldehyde can also be due to the geographical origin of the 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>cassia</italic> and the method used for the extraction of the extract and essential oil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].
