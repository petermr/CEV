 <italic>cassia</italic> extract, with LC

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). However, the efficacy of the essential oil and (

 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>cassia</italic> essential oil and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-cinnamaldehyde can be considered as potential candidates for the development of larvicidal and nymphicidal agents for tick control. This conclusion is justified from a toxicological and a mechanistic perspective. For instance, from a toxicological point of view, it is important not only to assess the efficacy of new plant-based pesticides on target species but also to estimate any effect on non-target species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Herein, we evaluated the effect of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>cassia</italic> essential oil and (

 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>molitor</italic> and 
 <italic>H</italic>. 
 <italic>axyridis</italic>. 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>molitor</italic> is presently being promoted as a beneficial insect, as it is capable of degrading polystyrene and plastic waste, and may play an important role in litter decomposition [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In addition, 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>molitor</italic> larvae are often used as pet food, and offer a promising alternative protein source for human and animal nutrition [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Besides this, predatory behavior of

 <italic>molitor</italic> on ticks has been reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. 
 <italic>H</italic>. 
 <italic>axyridis</italic> is a biocontrol agent of pests including aphids, scales, and other phytophagous pests, and plays an important role in regulating the populations of these pests [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Topical application of the essential oil (tested concentration: LC
 <sub>50</sub> 3.81 and 21.31 mg/mL for unfed larvae and nymphs of

 <italic>longicornis</italic>) or (

 <italic>axyridis</italic> adults (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A, B), which may indicate that these compounds are environmentally safe. Generally, essential oils and their active compound(s) are not toxic to non-target organisms [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], in accordance with our results. For example, essential oil from
