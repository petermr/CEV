 <italic>cassia</italic> and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-cinnamaldehyde significantly affected the activities of detoxification enzymes in ticks, including those of esterase and monooxygenase. For example, in contrast to the fenvalerate treatment, esterase activity was significantly increased in larvae [Fig.

 <italic>cassia</italic> essential oil (tested concentration: LC

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). On the other hand, similar to the effects of fenvalerate, monooxygenase activity was significantly increased in the larvae [Fig.

 <italic> F</italic>
 <sub>(4,10)</sub> = 22.346,

 <italic>cassia</italic> essential oil and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-cinnamaldehyde. Esterase and monooxygenase are involved in the metabolic detoxification of pesticides [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In ticks, they play an important role in the development of resistance to synthetic acaricides [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. For example, resistance to synthetic pyrethroids was found to be significantly correlated with increase esterase and monooxygenase activities in 
 <italic>Rhipicephalus microplus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. It has also been demonstrated that the inhibition of detoxification enzymes, including esterase, led to an increase in the mortality of a resistant strain of 
 <italic>R. microplus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The increased expression of esterase and monooxygenase in the present study may indicate their involvement in the detoxification response against 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>cassia</italic> essential oil and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-cinnamaldehyde. However, additional studies are needed to test different times of exposure, since esterase and monooxygenase activities may decrease with time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], and to explore the contribution of other metabolic enzymes such as acetylcholinesterase and glutathione S-transferases to defense mechanisms. It is important to note that the total protein content of 
 <italic>H</italic>. 
 <italic>longicornis</italic> after treatment with 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>cassia</italic> essential oil, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-cinnamaldehyde and fenvalerate ranged from 0.98 to 1.05 mg/mL for the larvae and 0.96–1.13 mg/mL for the nymphs, and treatment with the essential oil, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-cinnamaldehyde and fenvalerate did not induce significant changes in the total protein of either.
