 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. However, there are potential safety concerns regarding cinnamaldehyde. For example, cinnamaldehyde at certain exposure concentrations reduces adenosine triphosphate levels and disrupts mitochondrial function in human bronchial epithelial cells [

 <italic>cassia</italic> products, concentrationâ€“response curves should be determined. These can be used to identify lethal and non-lethal concentrations for ticks and mammalian hosts. Additionally, application of

 <italic>cassia</italic> products directly to the host may provide better protection from tick infestation, since hosts can be kept in enclosures to protect them against environmental factors including weather conditions that could interfere with the efficacy of the applied products [
