<p id="Par25">In addition, based on the present results, the efficacy of 
 <italic>C. cassia</italic> essential oil in terms of LC
 <sub>50</sub> values, i.e. lower concentrations compared with those of the extract (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), may be attributed to the high percent content of the main component, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-cinnamaldehyde. (
 <italic>E</italic>)-cinnamaldehyde is the key component of 
 <italic>C. cassia</italic> bark responsible for its insecticidal and acaricidal activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. When tested as a pure compound, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-cinnamaldehyde was effective against the larvae and nymphs of 
 <italic>Rhipicephalus sanguineus</italic>, with 100% mortality at 2.55 and 10 μL/mL, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. A similar observation was recorded for the larvae of 
 <italic>Amblyomma cajennense</italic> at a (
 <italic>E</italic>)-cinnamaldehyde concentration of 5.0 μL/mL [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Likewise, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-cinnamaldehyde was effective with 100% mortality at a concentration of 5 μL/mL against 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>microplus</italic> and 
 <italic>Dermacentor nitens</italic> larvae [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Acaricidal activity of (
 <italic>E</italic>)-cinnamaldehyde was also observed against the larvae of 
 <italic>Amblyomma sculptum</italic> (LC
 <sub>50</sub> 1.40 mg/mL) and 
 <italic>D</italic>. 
 <italic>nitens</italic> (LC
 <sub>50</sub> 1.68 mg/mL) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Besides its efficacy against ticks, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-cinnamaldehyde was found to be an efficient mosquito larvicidal against 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>, 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> and 
 <italic>Armigeres subalbatus</italic>, with LC
 <sub>50</sub> values below 50 µg/mL [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].
