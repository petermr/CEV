<p id="Par11">Unfed adult ticks of 
 <italic>H. longicornis</italic> were collected from vegetation by tick dragging at Xiaowutai National Nature Reserve Area (40°03′03″N, 115°23′15″E), Zhangjiakou, Hebei Province, China. Unfed adult ticks were placed on the ears of New Zealand white rabbits and the resulting engorged females were maintained in an incubator [26 ± 1 °C, 85 ± 5% relative humidity (RH), 16:8 h (light:dark; L:D) photoperiod] for oviposition. The larvae that hatched during a period of 14 days and the nymphs that molted during a period of 14 days were used for subsequent tests.
