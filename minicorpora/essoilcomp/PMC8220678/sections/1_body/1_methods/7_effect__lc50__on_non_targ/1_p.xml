 <italic>cassia</italic> essential oil (3.81 and 21.31 mg/mL, respectively) and (

 <italic>H</italic>. 
 <italic>axyridis</italic> were assessed by using a minor modification of the method described by Youn et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In the present study, 1 µL of the test solutions was topically applied to adults at the junction between the pronotum and elytron using a micropipette (Eppendorf). Adults of

 <italic>H</italic>. 
 <italic>longicornis</italic> (0.14 and 1.89 mg/mL) were used as positive controls. Negative control groups included adults exposed to 70% methanol and distilled water. Treated adults were transferred to clean Petri dishes (ten adults per dish), fed with 
 <italic>Metopolophium dirhodum,</italic> and maintained in an incubator [25 ± 1 °C, 70 ± 5% RH, 16:8-h photoperiod (L:D)]. The number of dead 
 <italic>H</italic>. 
 <italic>axyridis</italic> was determined 48 h after treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], with adults that did not respond to a probe considered dead. Each treatment and the control groups were replicated five times.
