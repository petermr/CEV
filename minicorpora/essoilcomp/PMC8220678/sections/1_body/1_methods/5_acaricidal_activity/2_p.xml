<p id="Par14">The LPT was carried out according to the
 <italic> in vitro</italic> test recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], as described by Godara et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Briefly, filter papers (7.5 × 9.0 cm, Whatman No. 1; Whatman, Maidstone, UK) were soaked with 1 mL of the dilutions. The treated filter papers were allowed to dry and were then folded into packets and sealed on the side with clips. One hundred larvae were introduced into each packet before sealing the top of with clips. The packets containing the larvae were kept in an incubator (26 ± 1 °C and 85 ± 5% RH). After 24 h, the packets were examined for larval mortality. Distilled water and 70% methanol served as the negative control group, and fenvalerate diluted with distilled water, as specified on the product label, served as the positive control. Each treatment and control group was replicated four times. A similar LPT was used for unfed nymphs, with ten nymphs placed into each packet; each treatment and the negative control group (distilled water and 70% methanol) and positive control group (fenvalerate) was replicated five times.
