<p id="Par13">Acaricidal activity against the larvae and nymphs of 
 <italic>H</italic>. 
 <italic>longicornis</italic> was determined using larval and nymphal packet tests. First, the bark extract of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>cassia</italic>, essential oil of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>cassia</italic>, and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-cinnamaldehyde were diluted with 70% methanol. There is little or no toxicity of 70% methanol when it is used as a solvent in the packet test
 <italic> in vitro</italic> (filter papers soaked with the test compounds were allowed to dry before use in a closed packet containing ticks) [see details of the larval packet test (LPT) below]. In addition, previous studies have shown that analytical grade methanol (undiluted) has little or no toxicity against tick species, and it has been suggested as a suitable solvent for dissolving plant extracts when testing acaricidal activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Then a range finding test was carried out to determine the appropriate test concentrations. For larvae, five concentrations were used, ranging from 5.00 to 20.00 mg/mL for the extract, 2.75–5.00 mg/mL for the essential oil, 2.75–3.70 mg/mL for (
 <italic>E</italic>)-cinnamaldehyde, and 0.025–0.750 mg/mL for fenvalerate. For nymphs, five to six concentrations were used, ranging from 40.00 to 60.00 mg/mL for the extract, 10.00–30.00 mg/mL for the essential oil, 5.00–30.00 mg/mL for (
 <italic>E</italic>)-cinnamaldehyde, and 0.38–4.50 mg/mL for fenvalerate.
