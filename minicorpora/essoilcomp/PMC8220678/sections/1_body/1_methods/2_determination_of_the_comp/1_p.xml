 <italic>cassia</italic> extract and essential oil were determined on a gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (model 7890A-5975C; Agilent Technologies, USA). Chromatographic separation was achieved using a DB-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm). The carrier gas was helium at 1 mL/min flow rate, and the spilt ratio 10:1. The temperature conditions were 60 °C for 2 min, increased to 150 °C for 1 min, and finally to 280 °C for 5 min. The mass spectrometer was bombarded with an electron impact ionization source, and the electron energy was 70 eV. The inlet temperature was 280 °C and the ion source temperature was 230 °C. The mass scanning range was 40–550 m/z. Compounds were identified using the Standard Reference Database of the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
