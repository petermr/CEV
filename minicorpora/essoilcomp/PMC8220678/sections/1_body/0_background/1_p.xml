 <italic>Haemaphysalis longicornis</italic> Neumann (Acari: Ixodidae) is an obligate hematophagous ectoparasite native to East Asian countries, and was recently found to be established in several states of the USA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In recent years, control of this tick has attracted much attention because of its ability to acquire and transmit numerous zoonotic pathogens, including severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In addition, it is a major pest of livestock in Australia and New Zealand, and infestation, which can cause exsanguination, can lead to economic losses related to reduced growth and production [

However, the demand for effective and safe alternative pesticides is increasing due to the adverse effects, including environmental pollution and undesirable effects on non-target species, associated with the intensive and injudicious use of synthetic pesticides [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Plant-based products including essential oils and extracts provide good alternatives because they are effective against a wide variety of pests and have little or no toxicity against non-target species [
