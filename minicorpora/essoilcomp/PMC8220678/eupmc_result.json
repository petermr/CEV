    "<h4>Background</h4>The tick Haemaphysalis longicornis (Neumann) is a well-known vector of numerous pathogens of veterinary and medical importance. Various control strategies, including the use of synthetic pesticides, have been developed to control this tick species. However, demand for effective and safe alternative pesticides is increasing due to the adverse effects associated with the intensive and injudicious use of synthetic pesticides, which include undesirable effects on non-target species and environmental pollution. Hence, the acaricidal activity of the extract and the essential oil of Cinnamomum cassia (Chinese cinnamon) and their major components, and the underlying mechanisms of this activity, were evaluated against unfed larvae and nymphs of H. longicornis.<h4>Methods</h4>The components of the extract and essential oil of C. cassia were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and their larvicidal and nymphicidal activity were evaluated using the larval and nymphal packet test. The underlying detoxification mechanism was elucidated by targeting in vivo esterase and monooxygenase activity, and the toxicological effect was assessed on non-target Tenebrio molitor and Harmonia axyridis by topical application in open Petri dishes.<h4>Results</h4>(E)-cinnamaldehyde was the predominant component of the extract (50.79%) and essential oil (89.95%). The 50% lethal concentration (LC<sub>50</sub>) for larvae and nymphs treated with the extract was 11.56 and 49.18 mg/mL, respectively. The essential oil, (E)-cinnamaldehyde and fenvalerate exhibited acaricidal activity, with LC<sub>50</sub> values of 3.81, 3.15, and 0.14 mg/mL, respectively, against the larvae, and 21.31, 16.93, and 1.89 mg/mL, respectively, against the nymphs. (E)-cinnamaldehyde significantly increased esterase and monooxygenase activity in both larvae and nymphs. Unlike fenvalerate, C. cassia essential oil and (E)-cinnamaldehyde did not cause mortality of T. molitor or H. axyridis adults.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study demonstrates that C. cassia essential oil and (E)-cinnamaldehyde have the potential to be developed into botanical-based larvicidal and nymphicidal agents for tick control."
