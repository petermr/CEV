<p>Swedish researchers have assessed the effect of a nasal spray containing the essential oil and flavonoids derived from 
 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic> on the course of allergic rhinitis. The essential oil contained large amounts of 1,8-cineole, davanone and linalool, with centaureidine dimethylether, casticin and quercetin dominant among the flavonoids. The preparation was administered to 12 patients with known allergic rhinitis and/or bronchial obstruction, or with allergic rhinitis with coexisting allergic conjunctivitis or with exercise-induced asthma. The preparation was applied immediately after noticing the characteristic allergic symptoms of the nose. The assessment of the preparationâ€™s effects was based on a questionnaire filled in by patients who subjectively assessed the symptoms. Five minutes after application of the spray, the patients reported alleviation of nasal symptoms similar to the use of an antihistamine medication or chromoglycan. The soothing effect lasted up to several hours. Seven patients with symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis also reported improvement in ocular symptoms, and three patients with obstructive bronchial disease reported improvement in bronchial symptoms. The results of the study indicate that a nasal spray with a mixture of essential oils and flavonoids present in 
 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic> can be effective in the treatment of allergic rhinitis and in the treatment of accompanying symptoms [
