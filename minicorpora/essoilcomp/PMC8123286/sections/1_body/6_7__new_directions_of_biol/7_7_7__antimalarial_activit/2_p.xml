<p>In the next in vitro test evaluating an influence of the nanoparticles on maturation and death of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasite the scientists used non hemolytic concentration (2.5 Âµg/mL). Different mechanism of action of the two 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> species was noted. 
 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic>-AgNPs exhibited antiplasmodial activity leading to parasite death in comparison with the control after 24 and 48 h of treatment. Contrariwise, 
 <italic>A. arborescens</italic>-AgNPs antiplasmodial effect was associated with the parasite maturation stage blockage from trophozoite to ring stage. Futhermore, Avitabile et. al. measured IC
 <sub>50</sub> of different silver nanoparticles. The results demonstrated that 
 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic>-AgNPs displayed better antiplasmodial effect considering 50%, 90% and 99% inhibition concentrations [
