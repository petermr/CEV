<p>The potential antimalarial properties of silver nanoparticles from two 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> species: 
 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic> and 
 <italic>A. arborescens</italic> were studied. In the experiment, the hemocompatibilty of the nanoparticles using a microplate reader to measure the absorbance of hemoglobin release in supernatant were evaluated. The test was carried out on parasitized (
 <italic>P. falciparum)</italic> red blood cells (pRBCs). The cells were incubated for 24 and 48 h at 37 and 41 °C and at concentrations of nanoparticles: 0.6 µg/mL; 1.25 µg/mL; 2.5 µg/mL; 5 µg/mL and 7.5 µg/mL. Hemolysis assay revealed a better hemo-biocompatibility of 
 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic> silver nanoparticles (
 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic>—AgNPs) than 
 <italic>A. arborescens</italic> silver nanoparticles (
 <italic>A. arborescens</italic>—AgNPs). Moreover, hemolytic activity increased in dose dependent manner. To evaluate parasite growth inhibition the team exposed pRBCs to the influence of different nanoparticles in concentrations ranging from 0.6 to 7.5 µg/mL for 24 and 48 h. Significant inhibition of the growth of the parasite in the presence of 
 <italic>A. arborescens</italic>—AgNPs has been observed.
