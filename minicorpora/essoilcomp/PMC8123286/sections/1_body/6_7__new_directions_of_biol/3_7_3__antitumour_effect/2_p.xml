 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic> and its individual components show antiproliferative activity against T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines (Jurkat line), breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7 line), cervical adenocarcinoma (HeLa line), colorectal adenocarcinoma (HT-29 line), and embryonic human kidney cell lines (HEK-293 line). The MTT-mediated assay was used to determine the change in cell viability. The antiproliferative effect of the extract against all the lines, except for the HEK-293 line, was proven. Chlorogenic acid and isochlorogenic acid showed the greatest activity against these lines [
