<p>The antitumour activity of the essential oil obtained from the herb of 
 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic> was tested against the rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cell line. The growth or inhibition of cancer cell proliferation was measured using the dye 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), which, when influenced by mitochondrial dehydrogenase present in living cells, changes colour from orange to dark blue. The viability of RD cells after the application of the essential oil at concentrations of 25, 50 and 100 μg/mL was 29.679%, 20.833%, and 20.256%, respectively. The negative control with DMSO and the positive control with methotrexate showed 32.179% and 18.205% survival of RD cells, respectively. The results of the study prove that the essential oil of 
 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic>, especially in concentrations of 50 and 100 μg/mL, has an antitumour effect, probably due to the presence of compounds such as: borneol, cymene, camphor, terpineol, 1,8-cineole, and aromadendrene [
