<p>Researchers from Romania have examined the activity of the essential oil obtained from the herb of 
 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic> against a strain of 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>. The disc diffusion method was also adopted as the test method. The measured zone of growth inhibition was 23.5 mm for the oil obtained by steam distillation and 21.5 mm for the oil obtained by extraction with dichloromethane. The growth inhibition zone for nystatin as the control was 20.5 mm. The results of the study indicate that 
 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic> exhibits stronger antifungal activity than nystatin, which is a medication commonly used in the treatment of fungal infections [
