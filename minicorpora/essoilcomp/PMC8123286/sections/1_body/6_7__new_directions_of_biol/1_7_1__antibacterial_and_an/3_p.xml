<p>Iranian researchers have also investigated the activity of the essential oil of 
 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic> against pathogenic microorganisms. They tested the effect of the oil on the following bacteria: 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus subtillis</italic>, 
 <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and the fungus 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>. For this purpose, they used the method of diffusion in agar wells. The use of 15, 25 or 40 μL of the essential oil was shown to inhibit the growth of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, while the use of 10, 15, 25 or 40 μL of the essential oil inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. The authors of the study indicate that the antimicrobial effect of 
 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic> can be attributed to the compounds contained in the plant, such as borneol, cymene, camphor, terpineol, 1,8-cineole, and aromadendrene [
