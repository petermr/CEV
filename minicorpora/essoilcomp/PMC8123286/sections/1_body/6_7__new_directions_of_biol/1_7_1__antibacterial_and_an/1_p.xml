<p>The studies of the antibacterial and antifungal activities of ethanolic extracts from the herb of 
 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic> were performed by Suresh et al. Using the disc diffusion method and the serial dilution method, the effect of the extracts on the bacteria: 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>B. stearothermophilus</italic>, 
 <italic>Micrococcus luteus</italic>, 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas cepacia</italic>, 
 <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic>, and the fungi: 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, 
 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, 
 <italic>Trichosporon beigelii</italic>, was tested. The control treatment was performed with 1 mg/mL penicillin for the bacteria and 500 Î¼L/mL amphotericin B for the fungi. The extract proved to be effective against all the pathogens except 
 <italic>B. subtillis</italic>. The maximum zone of growth inhibition among the bacteria was obtained for 
 <italic>P. cepacia</italic> (28.6 mm) after using the 
 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic> ethanolic extract at 30 mg/mL. The inhibition zone for the control was 31.4 mm. Among the fungi, significant activity was demonstrated with the use of 30 mg/mL extract for 
 <italic>T. beigelii</italic> (17 mm) and 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (17 mm), compared with the control samples for which the zones of growth inhibition were 21 mm and 26 mm, respectively. It was also shown that the antimicrobial effect of the extract depended on its concentration [
