<p>Under another study the antioxidant activity of the essential oil isolated from the herb of 
 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic> was tested. For this purpose, they determined the percentage inhibition of peroxidation of egg yolk lipids using the thiobarbituric acid method (TBARs). The reducing potential was investigated using the potassium hexacyanoferrate(III) method. In the TBARs test, 82.34% inhibition of lipid peroxidation was recorded after application of 1000 μL of the essential oil. The reducing potential of 100 μL of the oil was 135.97 μg of butylated hydroxyanisole equivalent [
