<p>The latest study conducted in 2020 has also confirmed the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic>. The effects of the methanolic extract from the leaves of 
 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic> and of the individual components of the extract were determined using the β-carotene bleaching (BCB) method, the ability to reduce Fe(III) ions (FRAP test) and DPPH. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values recorded in the β-carotene bleaching test and the DPPH test were 35.4 μg/mL and 27.1 μg/mL, respectively, whereas for the butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) control the IC
 <sub>50</sub> was 2.7 μg/mL and 3.3 μg/mL, respectively. In the FRAP test, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> was 39.1 μg/mL, whereas for the trolox control the IC
 <sub>50</sub> was 3.2 μg/mL. The best results were obtained for rosmarinic acid (IC
 <sub>50</sub> in the bleaching test was 3.1 μg/mL, 2.7 μg/mL in the DPPH test, and 3.5 μg/mL in the FRAP test) [
