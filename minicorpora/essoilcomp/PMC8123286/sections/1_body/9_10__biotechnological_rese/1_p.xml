<p>A review of the scientific literature has shown that 
 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic> is a species that so far has sporadically been the object of research in the field of plant biotechnology. A protocol for the micro-propagation of this species has been only developed. Young leaves of the plant were sterilized and placed in the MS (Murashige and Skoog) medium supplemented with 4.44 µM 6-benzyladenine (BA) and 0.54 or 0.81 µM naphthyl-1-acetic acid (NAA). Abundant callus growth and shoot formation were achieved. With the addition of 4.44 μM BA and 0.54 μM of NAA, 3.61 shoots per explant were obtained (31 shoots in total), and with the addition of 4.44 μM BA and 0.81 μM NAA, 4.05 shoots per explant were obtained (total of 38 shoots). The obtained shoots were rooted using the MS medium without the growth regulators or supplemented with 0.49 µM indole acetic acid (IAA) or 0.54 µM NAA. Afterwards, the plants were transplanted into soil-filled pots [
