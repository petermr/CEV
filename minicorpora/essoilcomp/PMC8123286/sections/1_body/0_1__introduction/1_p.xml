<p>The awarding of the 2015 Nobel Prize in Medicine for the discovery of artemisinin [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-26-02503" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-26-02503" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], a sesquiterpenoid lactone, in 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> (annual mugwort) and proving its effectiveness in the treatment of malaria sparked a huge interest in the world of science in the chemistry and biological activity of other 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-02503" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-26-02503" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,

 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-02503" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. One of the better-known medicinal species of this genus in Europe and Asia is 
 <italic>Artemisia abrotanum</italic> L. (Asteraceae). This species occurs in the south-eastern part of Europe and in the countries of Central and North-Western Europe. This species also has its natural habitats in Asia Minor, Central Asia, and on the Arabian Peninsula [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-26-02503" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The herb of this species—
 <italic>Abrotani herba</italic>— occupies an important position in the traditional medicine of European countries [

 <xref rid="B11-molecules-26-02503" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It is recommended most often for the treatment of diseases of the liver and the biliary tract. It is also used as an effective anthelmintic in children, and as an antipyretic. Recent professional studies have proven previously unknown biological activities of extracts from the herb and/or the leaves, and/or the distilled-off essential oil, namely antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant, anticancer, and antiallergic properties [

 <xref rid="B12-molecules-26-02503" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Apart from the essential oil, the coumarins, phenolic acids and flavonoids present in the chemical composition of the plant are also responsible for the abovementioned biological effects. This species is also traditionally an object of interest of the food industry [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-02503" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A recent development was its approval by the European CosIng (Cosmetic Ingredients) database for use in the production of cosmetics and its growing role as a cosmetic plant [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-02503" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The aim of this article is to present the current state of knowledge regarding the position of 
 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic> in the history of medicine, its importance in modern traditional medicine, the chemical composition, new directions of biological activity and the resulting possible new therapeutic applications and prospects for use in cosmetology. The aim was also presentation of biotechnological studies of this species and its position in the food industry.
