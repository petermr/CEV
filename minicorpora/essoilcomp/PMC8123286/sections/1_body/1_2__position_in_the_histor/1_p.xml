 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic> is one of those medicinal herbs that can be found already in the first herbals of our civilization. Descriptions of it were included in both Dioscorides and Pliny the Elder [

 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-02503" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Noteworthy is the origin of the name “
 <italic>abrotanum</italic>”, which, according to Theophrastus of Eresos, may refer to a certain constitution of the body, namely to very thin and frail people (αβρος (abrós) in Greek means ‘slim, delicate’) [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-26-02503" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This reference is significant because it corresponds exactly to the constitution of patients who were originally recommended to use this herb, namely those suffering from chronic respiratory ailments. Of the lung diseases, the most difficult to treat over the millennia had been tuberculosis, leading to persistent wasting of the body, but chronic bronchitis or asthma may have clinically manifested themselves in this way as well. In holistic Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), this condition is called “Lung-Qi weakening, with particular weakening of the Yin of the lungs”, and is the dominant indication for TCM treatment with this herb to this day [

 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic> was also used in a number of other diseases, and its effects were widely known. In the Arab world, Avicenna, citing Galen among others, recommended its use in the absence of appetite, ulcers, and skin diseases, for hair growth, and as an amulet against evil spirits [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-02503" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The Slavs considered 
 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic> to be a cult “church herb”, used, for example, for making wreaths, hence its Polish name “boże drzewko” (“God’s little tree”) [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-02503" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In the Middle Ages, applications from antiquity were adopted, and in Germanic areas in the 10th century, the spectrum of treatments with 
 <italic>Artemisia abrotanum</italic> included broadly understood difficulty in breathing, pain from the liver, spleen, bladder and uterus, anthelmintic treatment, wound healing, to assist the stomach, intensify diuresis, and deter evil spirits [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-02503" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. A hundred years later, Hildegard of Bingen insisted on using this herb in compresses for leg pain [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-02503" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In the Renaissance era, due to the warming and drying properties of 
 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic>, it was recommended for use in ailments caused by cold and humidity, which mainly concerned the female genital tract and the functional circuits of the liver and spleen, according to the holistic nomenclature. This view was shared by the “Fathers of Botany”—Otto Brunfels [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-02503" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], Hieronymus Bock [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-02503" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and Leonhart Fuchs [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-02503" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and half a century later also by their worthy successor—Jacobus Tabernaemontanus [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-02503" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. At the apex of the development of holistic thought in Western medicine, the following secondary properties were attributed to 
 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic>: “
 <italic>dispersing</italic>, 
 <italic>diluting</italic>, 
 <italic>(surface) opening and cleansing effects”</italic> [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-02503" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. One of the most important Polish renaissance herbals—“Zielnik” by Simon Syrenius, also mentions the plant’s drying and warming effects as well as its effectiveness as a remedy against “venoms and poisons” (after Dioscorides and Pliny), repelling “venomous animals”, and in diseases of the lungs and the digestive system, and in women’s diseases [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-26-02503" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. 
 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic> was also used as an antipyretic, against internal parasites and externally in the treatment of scalp and hair diseases, and as an anti-inflammatory medication in eye diseases and ulcers of various origins. The plant was used to prepare an oil with analgesic and diuretic properties, wine stimulating the appetite and effective against jaundice, and vodka for respiratory ailments [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-26-02503" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In 19th-century folk medicine, the herb 
 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic> was known as a medicine for skin diseases (added to baths), for throat and ear ailments, for sprains (in the form of compresses), and for women’s and childhood diseases [
