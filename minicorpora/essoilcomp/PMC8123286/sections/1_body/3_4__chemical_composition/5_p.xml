<p>In addition to the essential oil, the herb of 
 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic> also contains compounds with phenolic structures. The research conducted at JSS University in Mysore (India) has documented the presence of phenolic compounds in the amount of 9.35 mg/g dry weight in terms of gallic acid, and the presence of flavonoids in the amount of 11.0 mg/g dry weight in terms of rutoside [

 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic> plants growing in Saudi Arabia, was dominated by rosmarinic, chlorogenic, caffeic and isochlorogenic acids [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02503-f002">Figure 2</xref>. Other studies, in turn, identified the flavonoids present in the plant, including apigenin, hyperoside, quercetin, quercitrin, kaempferol, luteolin, myricetin, rutoside, and also lactone - artemisinin [
