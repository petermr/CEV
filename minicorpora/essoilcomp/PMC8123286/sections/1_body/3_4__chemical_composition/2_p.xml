<p>In 2020, Lithuanian researchers determined the composition of the essential oil obtained from the herb of 
 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic> plants growing in Lithuania, which were at various stages of plant development. The compound that was present in the highest amounts was piperitone. The remaining substances isolated in large amounts were: 1,4-cineole, lavandulyl butanoate, aromadendrene, and isogermacrene D.
