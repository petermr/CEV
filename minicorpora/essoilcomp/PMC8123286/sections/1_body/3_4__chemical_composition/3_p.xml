<p>Egyptian researchers conducted a study in 2020 evaluating an influence of trace elements on productivity of 
 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic>. The main components isolated from essential oil of 
 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic> aerial parts were: 2-hydroxy-1,8-cineole, Î²-eudesmol, and camphor. In the experiment the scientists treated 
 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic> with foliar spray containing iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg) or manganese (Mn). The foliar application of Fe (3 g/L), Mg (8 g/L) or Mn (300 mg/L) significantly increased values of growth, yield, major constituents of essential oil and chemical composition of the plant in comparison with control [
