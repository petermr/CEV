<p>Fire ants are very aggressive after mound disturbance. When a person steps into a fire ant mound, probably no repellant can deter the agitated fire ants from stinging the intruder [
 <xref rid="B75-insects-11-00758" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. However, repellants can be useful in many other scenarios. They can be used to prevent fire ants from invading sensitive areas, such as electrical equipment, nursing homes, and hospitals. They are also potentially useful in suppressing the spread of fire ants by preventing them from re-entering quarantined objects/materials such as nursery stock and soil-moving equipment. Some synthetic insecticides can function as fire ant repellants. For example, bifenthrin and tefluthrin were used to repel fire ants from potting soil [

 <xref rid="B77-insects-11-00758" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Tremendous effort has been made in searching for effective and safe repellant alternatives, with numerous compounds/materials being investigated. Many classes of organic compounds have been reported as fire ant repellants (
