<p>Naturally occurring compounds/materials have been successfully used as active ingredients in fire ant baits and contact-based control products. Numerous fire ant repellants and fumigants have also been identified. However, these compounds/materials may represent only a small fraction of such compounds available in the nature. More rigorous and extensive research on this topic is expected and more collaboration with the insecticide industry is certainly needed to commercialize the identified active compounds/materials.</p>
