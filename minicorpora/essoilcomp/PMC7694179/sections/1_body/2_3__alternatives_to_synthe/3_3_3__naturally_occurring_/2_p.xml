<p>Several compounds and materials have been evaluated in the field and results are encouraging. For example, in a mound drench test essential oil of the Alaskan yellow cedar,

 <italic>Solenopsis invicta</italic> Buren × 
 <italic>Solenopsis richteri</italic> Forel) than the untreated check at the end of the 12-wk evaluation period. In a band application evaluation, plots treated with this essential oil maintained a 90–95% reduction in fire ant mounds from the 2nd to 17th wk [
