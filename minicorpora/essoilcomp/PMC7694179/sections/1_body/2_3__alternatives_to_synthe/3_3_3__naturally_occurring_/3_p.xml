<p>2-tridecanone is a major constituent of defensive secretions in tawny crazy ants, 
 <italic>Nylanderia fulva</italic>, an ant species that was reported to be able to displace red imported fire ants in the field [
 <xref rid="B56-insects-11-00758" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. 2-tridecanone is also a major part of the 
 <italic>N. fulva</italic> synergistic pheromone system [
 <xref rid="B72-insects-11-00758" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Two 2-tridecanone-based emulsifiable concentrates (in one formulation, piperonyl butoxide used as a synergist) were evaluated in the field as mound drench treatments [
 <xref rid="B73-insects-11-00758" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. At application rate of 5.28 mL/L and 14 days after mound drench treatment, 100% control was achieved with the PBO formulation and 90% control with the formulation without PBO. Due to low mammalian toxicity, no presence of hazardous synthetic organic solvents, no phytotoxicity at applied concentrations, and relatively low cost, both formulations of 2-tridecanone are promising alternatives to commercial insecticide products for fire ant mound drenches.
