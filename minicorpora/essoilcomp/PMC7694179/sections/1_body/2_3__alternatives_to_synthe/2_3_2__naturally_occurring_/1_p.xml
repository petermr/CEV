It is not surprising that they are also effective against fire ants. As insect nerve poisons, pyrethrins can kill ants within minutes to hours. Pyrethrin based products are usually used in ant mound treatments or surface sprays. In some pyrethrin products, piperonyl butoxide (PBO) was used as a synergist. Pyrethrins has been also used together with diatomaceous earth for mound treatments, most likely because diatomaceous earth alone is not effective enough to kill whole fire ant colonies. Pyrethrins have low toxicity to human and other mammals and can break down quickly in the environment, particularly in the presence of sunlight, therefore they are considered among the safest insecticides in the market. Unfortunately, bees and many aquatic organisms are highly sensitive to pyrethrins [
