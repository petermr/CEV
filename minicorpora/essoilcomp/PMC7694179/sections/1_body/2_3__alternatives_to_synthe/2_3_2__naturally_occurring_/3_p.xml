<p>Rotenone is a compound produced in the roots or rhizomes of the tropical legumes 
 <italic>Derris</italic>, 
 <italic>Lonchocarpus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Tephrosia</italic>, which has been used as an insecticide for 165 years. It interferes with the electron transport chain in mitochondria and prevents energy production [

Prior to the discovery and commercialization of spinosad, rotenone had been used as a broad-spectrum insecticide for the control of various pest insects, including fire ants. However, use of rotenone has been phased out in the USA since it was found that acute exposure to rotenone in rats produced brain lesions consistent with those observed in humans and animals with Parkinsonâ€™s disease, and that rotenone residue was persistent on some crops after treatment [

 <italic>Tephrosia vogelii</italic> and 
 <italic>Derris trifoliata</italic>, and root powder of 
 <italic>Derris hancei</italic> were evaluated as bait AIs against fire ants under both laboratory and field conditions [
