<p>Over 30 AIs are used in various contact insecticide products registered for use against fire ants in the U.S. (

 <xref rid="B37-insects-11-00758" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In addition to the synthetic insecticides, a number of naturally occurring organic compounds/mixtures have been used in controlling fire ants, including pyrethrins, spinosad, d-limonene, rotenone, and several plant essential oils. Diatomaceous earth, a natural inorganic material, has been used in treating fire ant mounds. Unlike other AIs that function as chemical toxins, diatomaceous earth physically damages the wax layers on the exoskeleton of insects, which causes them to die by desiccation. Treating fire ant mound with hot water [
