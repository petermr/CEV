<p>Contact insecticides are commonly used in spray/broadcast/drench/dust products to control fire ants. They are mainly used in area surface and mound treatments. Area surface application of contact insecticides required relatively more insecticides than other methods, and it also has greater environmental impact by eliminating other ant species in the treated areas. The fire ant is a mound-building ant species, where the mound is the above ground portion of the colonyâ€™s nest. The mounds of large fire ant colonies are quite visible, particularly when weather is cool and wet, such as in early spring. In the dry and hot summer, fire ants tend to stay deeper in the soil, so mounds may be less visible; however, a rainfall in the dry season will induce ants to rebuild a visible mound. The visibility of the mound makes it possible to kill ants by directly treating the ant nests using fast acting contact AIs. Since the insecticides are applied directly on the mound, its impact on non-target organisms is significantly reduced.</p>
