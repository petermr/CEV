<p>Fire ants build earthen nests that are relatively closed system, which makes nest fumigation a possible treatment option in fire ant management. A number of insecticides have been tested as fire ant fumigants [

 <xref rid="B102-insects-11-00758" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. 1,1,1,trichloroethane, an organic solvent, was used as fumigant for treating fire ant mounds [

Although positive results were observed in some cases, fumigation is not well exploited in managing fire ants. To our knowledge, there are only two fumigant-based products available in the current US market: Ant-Zap Ant Killer Mound Destroyer (Trifecta, LLC, Fayetteville, Arkansas) and Earthfire Injection System (Earthfire Fire Ant Eradication, Scottsdale, Arizona). Ant-Zap Ant Killer Mound Destroyer is CO
 <sub>2</sub> based fumigant product for fire ant mound treatment. Although this product is included in the OMRI list, scientific data to support its effectiveness is not available. Earthfire Injection System uses heat to vaporize the insecticide resmethrin and inject the toxic vapor into fire ant nests. This system caused a 84% reduction of fire ant mound activity in a field trial [
