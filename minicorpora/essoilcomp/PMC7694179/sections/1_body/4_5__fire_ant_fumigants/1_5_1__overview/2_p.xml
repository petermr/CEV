<p>Fumigants may be useful in fire ant quarantine treatments. Fire ants are a major concern for many countries facing the risk of its invasion. Eradication of ant colonies in the early stage of the invasion is key to prevent the new establishment of fire ants. In South Korea, there are multiple recent detections of fire ants and majority of those detections were around the main port areas of imported common trade containers, which indicates that disinfestation of the containers is necessary to prevent the introduction of fire ants. Ethyl formate was found to be effective in controlling 99.9% of fire workers and female alates at 46.1 and 37.7 g h m
 <sup>−3</sup> (lethal concentration × time) at 13 °C and 23 °C respectively, which provided strong support to further explore its use as a fumigant to disinfest fire ants from commerce shipping containers [
