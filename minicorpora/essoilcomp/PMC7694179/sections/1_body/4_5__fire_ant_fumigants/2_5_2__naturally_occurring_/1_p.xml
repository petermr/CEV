<p>In addition to ethyl format and allyl isothiocyanate, many other naturally occurring compounds/materials have been tested as fumigants against fire ants (
 <xref rid="insects-11-00758-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>), including defensive compounds from other ants [
 <xref rid="B55-insects-11-00758" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], plant materials [

 <xref rid="B108-insects-11-00758" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>], plant essential oils and their individual components [

 <xref rid="B66-insects-11-00758" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,

 <xref rid="B110-insects-11-00758" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. As expected, some fire ant repellants are also efficient fire ant fumigants. Many plant essential oils are fumigants against fire ants, such as sweet wormwood oil [

 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> oil, eucalyptus oil, wintergreen oil, mugwort oil, chrysanthemum oil, turpentine oil, forsythia oil [
 <xref rid="B109-insects-11-00758" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>], and sweet orange oil [
 <xref rid="B110-insects-11-00758" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. Plant essential oils may also be a rich source of new fire ant fumigants.
