<p>The collective foraging behavior of ants provides a good opportunity to utilize bait technology in their management. Foraging workers find and transfer bait back to the colony by trophallaxis, which allows the active ingredient (AI) contained in baits to be spread to other ants within their colony. When the AI is distributed to most of the colony members the ant colony will die. Baits are easy to apply and are environmentally friendly and safer to use because they require significantly less AI compared to other chemical control methods. Consequently, baits have become a preferred method in managing many pest ants, including imported fire ants. AIs need to be slow-acting because foraging workers need enough time to spread the AI within a colony before the onset of the toxic effect. The requirement of a slow-acting AI has significantly limited the number of insecticides that can be utilized as ant bait AIs. In fact, there are only eight AIs in commercial fire ant baits in the current US market (
