<p>Effort has been made in searching for naturally occurring compounds as fire ant bait AIs. Five compounds isolated from the root powder of 
 <italic>Periploca sepium</italic> Bunge (Asclepiadaceae), including four pregnane glycosides and one oligasaccharide, possess oral toxicity against fire ants. Among these five compounds, the periplocoside x, a pregnane glycoside, showed the greatest toxicity [
