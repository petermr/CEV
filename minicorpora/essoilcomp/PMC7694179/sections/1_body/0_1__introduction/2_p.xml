<p>The National Pesticide Information Center defines insecticides as pesticides that are formulated to kill, harm, repel or mitigate one or more species of insect (

Based on these criteria, four types of insecticides are used in fire ant management, including slow-acting stomach poisons which contain metabolic inhibitors or insect growth regulators, fast-acting contact poisons, repellants, and fumigants. Slow-acting stomach poisons are used in bait products and contact poisons in spray, broadcast, drench, or dust formulations for area and direct nest treatment. Repellants can be useful to exclude ants from some sensitive areas, such as electrical equipment and in hospitals and schools, where synthetic insecticides may be not desired. Fumigants can be useful not only in nest treatment, but also potentially in quarantine treatments, such as disinfesting fire ants from commercial shipping containers. Here we review the current status of chemical control in fire ants, available alternatives to synthetic insecticides, and compounds/materials that recently have been tested for their toxicity and repellency against fire ants.
