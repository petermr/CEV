    "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a global health burden that greatly impact patient quality of life and account for a huge number of deaths worldwide. Despite current therapies, several side effects have been reported that compromise patient adherence; thus, affecting therapeutic benefits. In this context, plant metabolites, namely volatile extracts and compounds, have emerged as promising therapeutic agents. Indeed, these compounds, in addition to having beneficial bioactivities, are generally more amenable and present less side effects, allowing better patient tolerance. The present review is an updated compilation of the studies carried out in the last 20 years on the beneficial potential of essential oils, and their compounds, against major risk factors of CVDs. Overall, these metabolites show beneficial potential through a direct effect on these risk factors, namely hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes, or by acting on related targets, or exerting general cellular protection. In general, monoterpenic compounds are the most studied regarding hypotensive and anti-dyslipidemic/antidiabetic properties, whereas phenylpropanoids are very effective at avoiding platelet aggregation. Despite the number of studies performed, clinical trials are sparse and several aspects related to essential oil’s features, namely volatility and chemical variability, need to be considered in order to guarantee their efficacy in a clinical setting."
