<p>In this study, the antibacterial effects of two plant species including 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> and 
 <italic>Oxalis corniculata</italic> were investigated. The genus 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> (Family Asteraceae) belongs to a valuable aromatic and medicinal plant group consisting of approximately 300 species found in the northern hemisphere. In Iran, there are about 34 native 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> spp. [

 <italic>. A. annua</italic> called Qinghaosu, Sweet Sagewort, Sweet Annie, Sweet Wormwood, Annual Wormwood, is an annual plant which is widely distributed in Europe, Asia and North America, originating in China [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This plant has been used to treat malaria since ancient times [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The anti-malarial property of this plant is due to the presence of artemisinin sesquiterpene, and this plant has the potential for commercial development because of this compound [

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Moreover, this plant has antimicrobial, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, antiparasitic properties due to the existence of secondary metabolites such as flavonoids, monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, coumarins, and aliphatic and lipid compounds [
