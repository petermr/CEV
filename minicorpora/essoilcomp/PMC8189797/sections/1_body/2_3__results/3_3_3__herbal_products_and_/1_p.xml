<p>The bacteriostatic effects of various concentrations of plant products were compared with particular concentration of antibiotics, the findings of which are showed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. The results are based on the number of isolates which are inhibited by different plant products concentrations. The most potent product, i.e. EoAa with a 56.7% inhibition of all isolates, seems to have the potential to substitute 13 used antibiotics including oxacillin, amoxicillin, ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, tetracycline, streptomycin, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, cefazolin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and cefixime (
