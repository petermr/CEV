 <italic>E. coli</italic> were identified in 91 samples out of the 138 urine samples included in this study. Identification of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> based on observation of Gram-negative coccobacilli, 
 <italic>β</italic>-hemolysis on blood agar, pink colonies on McConkey, greenish metallic sheen on EMB, indole production, positive MR reaction, nitrate reduction, enzymes production including catalase, Ornithine decarboxylase, 
 <italic>β</italic>-glucosidase, CO
 <sub>2</sub> production as well as glucose, lactose, manntiol and maltose fermentation. All 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates differ from each other, because they are distinct in their susceptibility pattern to the antibiotics used. The susceptibility pattern of the isolates to antibiotics used is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Since each isolate was resistant to at least three antibiotics, all isolates are referred to as MDR. Among the antibiotics used, meropenem and penicillins with the exception of piperacillin, were the most potent and weakest antibiotics against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates, respectively. After meropenem (91.90% ±1.89), piperacillin (78.94% ±3.41) was the most effective antibiotic, followed by the three antibiotics including imipenem (65.34% ±1.79), cefepime (67.77% ±2.20), and chloramphenicol (64.07% ±3.15).
