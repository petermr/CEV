<p>Of the 51 isolates affected by the activity of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> products, 12 isolates were susceptible to EoAa only, and 5 isolates were susceptible to EoAa and EtAa extract alone, and 2 isolates were susceptible to EoAa and AqAa extract alone. Exclusive inhibitory effects of the 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> products were detected on 11 isolates at the concentrations used, i.e. the bactericidal effects were not detected on them. EtAa extract MIC was lower than AqAa extract on 10 isolates, while AqAa extract efficacy was higher than EtAa extract on 13 isolates. EtOc extract showed no activity on 8 isolates out of 39 isolates susceptible to antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>O. corniculata</italic> extracts and MIC of AqOc extract was also lower on 19 isolates than EtOc extract.
