<p>The AqAa and EtOc extracts had no inhibitory effect on any of the isolates at the lowest concentrations used, and the antimicrobial effects of EoAa and AqOc extract were similar. In general, EoAa and EtOc extract were the most potent and the weakest bacteriostatic products, respectively. The inhibitory activity was similar for both 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> extracts, but the AqOc extract showed more bacteriostatic activity than the ethanolic type. The order of inhibition by the products can be shown as follows: EoAa&gt;AqOc&gt;EtAa = AqAa&gt;EtOc. The product's bactericidal effect can be expressed both in terms of the MIC/MBC ratio (&lt;4) and based on MBC alone. According to the latter case, the same inhibitory order is established for bactericidal activity, but the bactericidal effect of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> extracts is higher than that of 
 <italic>O. corniculata</italic> extracts based on the MIC/MBC ratio (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Therefore, in comparing the two methods, the findings can vary, although the activity of EoAa in both methods is higher than that of all extracts from both plants.
