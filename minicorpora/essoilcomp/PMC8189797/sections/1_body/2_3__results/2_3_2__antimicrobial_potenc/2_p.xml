<p>Some products had no effect on several isolates at the concentrations used. Some of them have an antimicrobial activity on one isolate, while the same isolate was not susceptible to another product from the same plant. According to the antimicrobial assay methods used, some products had a similar effect on different isolates and vice versa. Based on the results of agar well diffusion test shown in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> extracts had a greater effect on more isolates than 
 <italic>O. corniculata</italic> extracts. According to the data presented in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the most potent plant product used, EoAa, was capable of creating an inhibition zone (i.d) with a diameter of 20 ± 1.45 mm in 11.11 mg/ml concentration, although some extracts were able to make an i.d almost similar to EoAa. In the current study, the diameter range of i.d was from 4 ± 0.33 to 20 ± 1.45 mm. The mean i.d was higher in antibiotic- susceptible isolates than that of the studied herbal products.
