<p>The MIC and MBC values obtained from all products ranged from 10
 <sup>−4</sup> to 11.11 mg/ml, and in MICs less than 10
 <sup>−4</sup> mg/ml, none of the products had any activity on any of the isolates. In some cases, the MIC and MBC values for the products were the same, but in most cases the MBC values were higher than the MIC values. In 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> products, there were three cases of MIC =10
 <sup>−4</sup> mg/ml, including one case of EtAa extract and two cases of EoAa and also one case of MBC =10
 <sup>−4</sup> mg/ml of EoAa. Also in 
 <italic>O. corniculata</italic> extracts, two cases of MIC and two cases of MBC equal to 10
 <sup>−4</sup> mg/ml by AqOc extract were displayed.
