<p>RP-HPLC and GC-MS were used to analyze the presence of polyphenols, including catechins, quercetin and chlorogenic acid, in the extracts of both plants, as well as the constituents of essential oil, respectively. In order to identify polyphenols and quantify their amounts in the extracts, their standards have been used that the standard chromatogram of these compounds was demonstrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Catechins were detected in extracts from both plants, but the amount was higher in aqueous extracts than in ethanolic extracts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The levels of catechin in each of the products, including EtAa, AqAa, EtOc and AqOc extracts were 0.166, 0.271, 0.195 and 0.348 g/100 g DW, respectively. Quercetin was not detected in 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> extracts and was higher in aqueous extract (12.609 g/100 g DW) than in EtOc extract (4.311 g/100 g DW) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Chlorogenic acid could not be detected in extracts of both plants, except for the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> (0.684 g/100 g DW) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).
