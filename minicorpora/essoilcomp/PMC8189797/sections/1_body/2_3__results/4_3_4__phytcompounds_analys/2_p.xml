<p>Phytochemical analysis of EoAa using GC-MS identified 31 peaks belonging to 7 types of compounds, including monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpene, cycloalkanes, cycloalkenes, alkyne and aldehyde (
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Interestingly, about 50% of the EoAa constituents were terpenes, which included monoterpenes (16.25%) (alpha-pinene, camphene, 1,8-cineole, terpineol, Z-beta, cis-sabinene hydrate, borneol, Myrtenol, trans-(+)-carveol, and verbenene) and sesquiterpenes (21.8%)(alpha-copaene, rans-caryophyllene, germacrene, beta-selinene, bicyclogermacrene, caryophyllene oxide and ledene). The main terpenes contained germacrene (8.83%), 1,8-cineole (5.98%) and alpha-pinene (4.35%).
