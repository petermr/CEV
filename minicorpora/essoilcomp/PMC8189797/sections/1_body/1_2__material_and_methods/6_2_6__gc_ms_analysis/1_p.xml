<p>The 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> essential oil components was quantified by Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), an Agilent 6850 gas chromatograph coupled to an Agilent 7890A mass spectrometer. The components were separated on a HP-5MS UI capillary column (30 m, 0.25 mm, 0.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>m) including 5% phenyl polysiloxane as stationary phase. The oven temperature program was started at 50°C, retained for 3 min, then increased from 8°C min
 <sup>−1</sup> to 250°C, and retained for 2 min. The Injector, interface and ion source temperatures were retained at 250, 250 and 220°C, respectively. The split injection (1 
 <italic>μ</italic>l) was carried out with a 1 : 50 split ratio and helium was applied as carrier gas with flow-rate of 1 ml/min. The spectrometers operated in the electron ionization (EI) mode and the scan mass range, the ionization energy and the scan rate were 3–500 m/z, 70 eV and 0.2 s per scan, respectively. The components of the essential oil were identified based on a comparison of their mass spectra with those of the NIST mass library [
