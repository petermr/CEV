<p>To evaluate the antibacterial potency of extracts and essential oil, the agar well diffusion and broth micro-dilution susceptibility methods were used. Due to the long name of each plant product, the abbreviations of each of them are as follows: essential oil, ethanolic and aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> = EoAa, EtAa and AqAa; ethanolic and aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>O. corniculata</italic> = EtOc and AqOc. To perform the diffusion agar well diffusion test, plates containing Muller Hinton Agar (MHA) medium are prepared and then 10 mm diameter wells are made on the medium using a cork borer. After preparation of the MAH medium, a suspension with a 0.5 McFarland (1.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/ml) density is prepared from the test isolate and spread on the surface of the medium using a swab moistened with bacterial suspension. About 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of each plant product (10
 <sup>−1</sup> to 10
 <sup>−7</sup>) is inoculated into the well. All plates are incubated for 24 h at 37°C and then the diameters of the inhibition zones were measured [
