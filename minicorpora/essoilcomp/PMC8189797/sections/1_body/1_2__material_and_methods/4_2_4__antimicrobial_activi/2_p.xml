<p>In the broth micro-dilution susceptibility method, 96-well microplate was used to determine minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of plant products. A serial dilution of 10
 <sup>−1</sup> to 10
 <sup>−7</sup> was prepared from each product and 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of product, 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of MHA medium and 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of 0.5 McFarland suspension from the test isolate were added within each well. MIC and MBC of each product were determined after incubation for 24 h at 37°C. To determine MBC, the content of the well without growth was inoculated on the MHA plate and if the isolate did not grow on the plate, that concentration was considered as MBC [
