<p>The oil extraction was performed according to the European Pharmacopoeia. A 300 g of the leaf powder of 
 <italic>O. corniculata</italic> was mixed with 1000 ml of distilled water in 1000 ml distillation flask and hydrodistilled using an apparatus of Clevenger type for 3 h. The distillation flask was put in the hot plate and, with the addition of boiling chips, allowed the sample to boil until the distillation was accomplished. The extract (distillate) was collected in receiver apparatus. The extracted fractions of leaves displayed two separate layers including the lower aqueous layer and an upper oily layer. The oil was separated from the aqueous layer using a separatory funnel by extracting it twice with chloroform. After filtration of extracted oil, the chloroform was removed using rotary evaporator at 35°C. The obtained oil was dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate, filtered, concentrated under vacuum and then stored at 4°C in refrigerator until used for antimicrobial analysis [
