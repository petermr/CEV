<p>In aqueous extraction, 1 g of the leaf powder is soaked in 10 ml of distilled water in conical flask and put at 90°C for 60 min. Finally, the resulting suspension is incubated as overnight on the shaker incubator at 37°C, 150 rpm. Aqueous extract obtained was separated from solid residues by filtration using Whatman No. 1 filter paper. For ethanolic extraction, 1 g of each grinned plant material was extracted by 15 ml ethanol 70% for 12 h with continuous vigorous shaking at 30 min intervals. Then, the mixtures were filtered through Whatman No. 1 filter paper. The filtrate was collected and condensed by the rotary evaporator at 80°C for ethanol removal [
