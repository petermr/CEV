<p>This study was conducted on 138 urine cultures were obtained from patients, both women and men, suspected to have an UTI. The freshly voided midstream urine samples were transferred to the laboratory to avoid contamination as quickly as possible on deliver. Urine specimen was inoculated on the Cystine Lactose Electrolyte-Deficient (CLED) agar using standard culture methods. The CLED plates were incubated for 24 h at 37°C. Urine samples that contain ≥10
 <sup>5</sup> colony-forming per milli-liter (CFU/ml) are considered positive [

 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. After isolation of bacteria using culture, Gram staining and biochemical differential tests were used to identify
