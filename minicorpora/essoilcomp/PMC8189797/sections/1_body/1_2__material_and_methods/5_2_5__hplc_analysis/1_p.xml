<p>The extracts were analyzed using Reversed- phase High- performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) to exhibit and quantify of antimicrobial compounds including catechin, quercetin and chlorogenic acid. A 1 g of grind leaves was extracted with 6 ml of methanol and acetic acid extraction solvent (85 : 15, v/v). The obtained extract was filtered, concentrated and dried using a rotary evaporator. The dried extract was being dissolved in the mobile phase. Fifty

 <italic>μ</italic>m 5 × 150 mm (Waters, Dublin, Ireland), at 280 and 320 nm. The compounds were detected by comparing retention times and UV-DAD (280 and 320 nm) spectra with those for standard solutions. In order to measure phenolic acid in extracts, the integrated peak area was calculated, and the contents were estimated using the calibration curve by plotting the peak area against the concentration of the corresponding standard sample [
