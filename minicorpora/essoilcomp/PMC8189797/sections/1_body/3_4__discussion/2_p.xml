<p>In the current study, two antimicrobial testing methods including agar well diffusion and microdilution, were used to assess antimicrobial activity. The results of the two antimicrobial tests were almost consistent. For several reasons, well diffusion method has limitations and is only used for initial screening. First, since essential oils and their constituents are hydrophobic, they do not disperse evenly in the agar medium [
