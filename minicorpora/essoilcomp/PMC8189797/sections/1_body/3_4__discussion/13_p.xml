<p>In most cases, the antimicrobial potency of the herbal products used in this research differed from that of other studies. Despite the fact that methanolic extract was not used in this study, results from other studies have shown that it is the most effective extract. Methanol is probably to be a suitable correlation with phenolic compounds, thus increasing its antimicrobial activities. The essential oils used in this analysis had different components and activities than those used in other studies, but some of the components were similar. However, the proportions of the components were different. This can be affected by method of extraction, distillation equipment, soil physicochemical parameters, plant age, plant cultivation techniques, density of plant population, harvest time, branch and leaf condition, relative humidity, the geographic environment, climate and managers [
