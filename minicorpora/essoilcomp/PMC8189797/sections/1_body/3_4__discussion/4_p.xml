<p>In another report, Prakash et al. found that a methanolic extract of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> had higher antibacterial activity on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria than other extracts, though this extract's antibacterial activity was not observed on Gram-negative bacteria including 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic>, but it did show almost significant activity on 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (MIC =2 mg/ml and i.d = 17 mm) [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In the Kim et al. survey, the resistance of periodontopathic bacteria to various extracts of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> varied, with only the aqueous extract having activity on 
 <italic>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</italic> (MIC = 14 mg/ml) and this bacterium being resistant to other organic extracts [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The antimicrobial activity of different 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> species against pathogenic bacteria and fungi was found to be dependent on the solvent concentration used for extraction in the Hrytsyk et al. report [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Appalasamy et al. found that bioactive compounds isolated from 
 <italic>A. annua</italic>, such as artemisinin and a precursor, had a poor inhibitory effect on Gram-positive bacteria such as 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic>, similar to streptomycin. As a result, using only one component of an essential oil might not be efficient, even though using, preparing, and applying each component is simpler and more appropriate than using essential oils or extracts. Their results show that MICs less than 0.09 mg/ml inhibit the growth of extract-susceptible microorganisms [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This MIC value was within the range of the MIC values obtained from research.
