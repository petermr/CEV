<p>Hameed et al. evaluated the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> methanolic extracts on 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Both isolates had an i.d range of 0.70 ± 0.10 to 50 ± 0.20 mm, with 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> having an i.d of 3.17 ± 0.15 mm, which was less than the minimum i.d (40.33 mm) obtained in this study. Antibiotics such as cefuroxime, streptomycin, and rifampin had a lower inhibitory effect on 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> than methanolic extract, even though the inhibitory effect of the extracts used in this study was lower than streptomycin and cefuroxime. Phytochemical analysis of essential oils identified 59 compounds that were almost entirely different from the compounds found in the current research [
