<p>Using liquid chromatography/diode array detector-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization/mass spectrometry (LC/DAD-APCI/MS) at 335 nm, Lai et al. and Han et al. were able to detect more than 40 compounds in the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>A. annua,</italic> including chlorogenic acid and quercetin, while only chlorogenic acid was detected in the aqueous extract in the current study [
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Ivanescu et al. qualitatively detected chlorogenic acid in the methanolic extract of the aerial portion of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> and, in contrast to our research, was able to identify and quantify quercetin at 2.456 mg/100 g dry herb and 3.33.6 mg/100 g dry herb in the methanolic extract alone and treated with hydrochloric acid, respectively [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In the Carvalhoa et al. analysis, catechins, quercetin, and chlorogenic acid were detected in the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> leaves in amounts of 79.53 ± 0.123, 0.74 ± 0.004, and 0.76 ± 0.022 mg/g dry matter, respectively. Catechin levels were approximately 35 times higher than those measured in AqAa extract (the highest amount of catechin and the only product containing chlorogenic acid) of our sample, but chlorogenic acid levels were about 9 times lower [
