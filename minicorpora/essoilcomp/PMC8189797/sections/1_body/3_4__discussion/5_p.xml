<p>Rolta et al. examined the antimicrobial effects of methanolic and petroleum ether extracts of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> on drug-resistant bacteria and fungi alone and in combination with antibiotics. Bacterial strains are more sensitive to 
 <italic>Candida</italic> strains than to the bacteriostatic activity of these extracts, according to the results of their experiment. These extracts had a synergistic effect when combined with antibacterial and antifungal antibiotics, lowering MICs by 4-264 times against bacterial (
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>) and 
 <italic>Candida</italic> strains and increasing inhibitory activity. Using the diffusion method, none of these extracts showed antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (ATCC25922) or 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (ATCC29213), but methanolic extracts with MIC = 0.125 mg/ml and ether extract with MIC = 0.65 mg/ml inhibited both bacteria. In essential oil, thirteen compounds were identified, none of which were comparable to the essential oil compounds detected in this study [
