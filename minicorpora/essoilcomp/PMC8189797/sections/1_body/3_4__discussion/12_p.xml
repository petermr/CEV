<p>In analysis of phytochemical components and antibacterial potential of different parts of 
 <italic>O. corniculata</italic> against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>Rhodococcus fascians</italic> by Kaur et al., it was found that the leaves had more flavonoid and phenolic contents, and the seeds and stems had less phenolic and flavonoid contents, respectively. Leaves and seeds had the highest and lowest antibacterial activity, respectively [

 <italic>O. corniculata</italic> leaves grown in moist, marshy and dry areas revealed that 13 phenolic compounds, including quercetin (0.226 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/g), are more abundant in dry samples, followed by marshy and moist samples. However, the total flavonoid and phenolic content of the samples differed [
