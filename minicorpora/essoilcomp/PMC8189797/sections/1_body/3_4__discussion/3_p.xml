<p>The antimicrobial activity of the essential oil was higher than that of the extracts among the 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> products. The explanation for this may be due to a greater variety of antibacterial compounds, the antimicrobial efficiency of essential oil materials, the type of plant cultivar, or the solvents used in the essential oil extraction, preparation, and so on [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The essential oil of this plant was the subject of the majority of antimicrobial studies performed on it [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The extracts of this plant had almost similar bacteriostatic and bacteriocide effects. This contradicted the findings of other research. Donato et al. studied the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> essential oil and its major components against seven foodborne pathogens. The i.d of 1.27 ± 0.31 mm and MIC =17.6 mg/ml was obtained of these products against pathogens such as 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> O157 [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The analysis of their essential oils revealed 27 compounds, of which monoterpenoids constituted 1.4% and cisquiterpenes constituted 91% of the essential oil, whereas in this study, monoterpenoids and cisquiterpenes constituted 16.25% and 21.8% of the 31 compounds found in the essential oils, respectively. However, some essential oil constituents were found to be identical in both studies.
