<p>In this research, among 
 <italic>O. corniculata</italic> products, aqueous extract had a higher antimicrobial potency than ethanolic extract. Adnan Siddiqui et al. reported that different 
 <italic>O. corniculata</italic> extracts had different effects on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. According to their results, the most active extracts were aqueous and methanol extracts, which were comparable to tetracycline inhibition activity. Phytochemical analysis of extracts with the highest inhibitory activity indicated the existence of antimicrobial compounds such as phenolic compounds, alkaloids, flavonoids, and others [

 <italic>O. corniculata</italic> leaf was observed against pathogenic bacteria such as 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Shigella</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, so that the i.d ranged from 12 ± 0 to 19 ± 0.5 mm and the highest was correlated with 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. The MIC range was 0.08 ± 0.00 to 0.13 ± 0.00 mg/ml, with the lowest 0.08 ± 0.00 mg/ml against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. In comparing extracts and antibiotics against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, the extract had a higher bacteriostatic rate than the antibiotics ampicillin, doxycycline, and streptomycin, but the MIC value was different from the diameter determination, and the amount of MIC of ampicillin and streptomycin is half that of the extract against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> [
