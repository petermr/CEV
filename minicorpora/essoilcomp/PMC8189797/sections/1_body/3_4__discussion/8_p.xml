<p>In the current survey, the extracts were assayed for antibacterial flavonoid compounds including catechins, quercetin and chlorogenic acid. Catechin appears to be working through many different mechanisms. It disrupts cell membranes by binding to bilayer membranes and inhibiting or inactivating the synthesis of intracellular and extracellular enzymes [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], as well as respiratory bursts by generating reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], which disturb membrane permeability. Catechin also disrupts cell wall synthesis by binding to peptidoglycans [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Several antibacterial mechanisms, including DNA gyrase inhibition [
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], ATP hydrolysis inhibition [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], and metal complexation [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], have been proposed for quercetin. Chlorogenic acid, like catechin, damages cell membranes [
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].
