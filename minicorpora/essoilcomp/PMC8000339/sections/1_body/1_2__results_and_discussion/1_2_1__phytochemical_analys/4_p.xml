<p>Furthermore, to identify and quantify particular phenolic constituents, each methanolic extract was subjected to detailed LC–MS/MS analysis. The separation of the analytes was done on a reversed-phase C18 column, and their quantification was performed in MRM (multiple reaction monitoring) modes via the isotopic dilution method. The identity of all analytes was confirmed by two qualifying MRM transitions and retention times. Results are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-10-00550">Supplementary Table S2</xref>. Among the 33 investigated analytes, 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> methanolic extracts contained seven hydroxybenzoic acids, six hydroxycinnamic acids, and seven flavonoids. For better visualization and to compare the thirteen selected 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> species, a heatmap clustering the compounds and species according to their correlation was constructed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00550-f002">Figure 2</xref>). For that, the levels of phenolics (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-10-00550">Supplementary Table S2</xref>) were transformed using common logarithm (log10). After that, data were evaluated for the number of clusters using the silhouette method in RStudio. As results, the thirteen 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> sp. were divided into three main clusters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00550-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The first one was also subclustered into three groups, while the other two were subclustered into two groups. In the first, there were 
 <italic>M. villosa</italic> and 
 <italic>M. suaveolens,</italic> which presented the highest levels of RA, caffeic acid (CA), 
 <italic>p</italic>-methyl coumarate (pMCA), ferulic acid (FA), and 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid (pCA) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00550-f002">Figure 2</xref>). RA was the main compound found in all examined extracts, with levels ranging from 1363.38 ± 83.23 μg/g (
 <italic>M. cervina</italic>) to 2557.08 ± 64.21 μg/g (
 <italic>M. suaveolens</italic>) (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-10-00550">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). The other two sub-clusters were composed of 
 <italic>M. arvensis</italic>, 
 <italic>M. aquatica</italic>, 
 <italic>M. longifolia</italic>, and 
 <italic>M. cervina,</italic> mainly because of their high levels of ChA, 
 <italic>trans</italic>-cinnamic acid (tCA), and quercetin (QUE), and lower values of vanillic acid (VA) and rutin (RUT). Opposite results were observed in all 
 <italic>M. piperita</italic> sp. and 
 <italic>M. microphylla</italic>, located in the second cluster (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00550-f002">Figure 2</xref>). They were also separated into two subclusters; first with 
 <italic>M. piperita</italic> and 
 <italic>M. microphylla</italic> and second with 
 <italic>M. x piperita</italic> var. 
 <italic>citrata</italic> and 
 <italic>M. x piperita</italic> Bergamot, mainly due to the high levels of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4HBA), salicylic acid (SaA), salicylic acid-2-
 <italic>O</italic>-β-glucoside (SaAG), and the flavonoids naringenin (NAR) and hesperidin (HESP) in the first ones. Among hydroxybenzoic acids, SaAG was the most abundant representative, ranging from 3.27 ± 0.16 μg/g (
 <italic>M. spicata</italic>) to 149.79 ± 8.14 μg/g (
 <italic>M. arvensis</italic>) (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-10-00550">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Additionally, HESP (up to 121.95 ± 2.35 μg/g) and LUT (up to 31.03 ± 0.16 μg/g) were the most abundant flavonoids found in all examined extracts. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents the most comprehensive analysis of phenolic compounds of these 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> species.
