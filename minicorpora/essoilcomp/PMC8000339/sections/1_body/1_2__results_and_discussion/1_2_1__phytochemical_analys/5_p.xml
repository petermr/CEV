<p>In general, the results presented here were in agreement with those found in the literature (

 <xref rid="B58-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], flowering plays a crucial role in the reduction of rosmarinic acid levels in spearmint (
 <italic>M. spicata</italic>) and peppermint (
 <italic>M. piperita</italic>). Though studied 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> species were collected at the flowering stage, they still possessed significant amounts of rosmarinic acid. Many the traditional and uses in official medicine of peppermint, spearmint, and other mint species are closely related to the presence of these phenolic compounds. Infusions obtained from leaves of several 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> species are frequently used as folk remedies for the treatment of anorexia, hypertension, ulcerative colitis, etc. [

 <xref rid="B9-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In the plant, RA serves as a defense compound against pathogens and herbivores, while its most prominent benefits for humans are antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral activities [
