<p>Additionally, the Czech genotype of 
 <italic>Mentha x villosa</italic> showed significant amounts of phenolic compounds (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-10-00550">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). This can be attributed to the fact that this genotype is related to 
 <italic>M. suaveolens</italic>, which originated by crossing this genotype with 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic>. A literature overview showed that 
 <italic>M. piperita</italic> and 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic> are also quite rich in phenolics (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00550-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which corresponded with the results presented here (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-10-00550">Table S1 in Supplementary Material</xref>). Among 
 <italic>M. x piperita</italic> genotypes, the 
 <italic>M. x piperita var. citrata</italic> contained the lowest amount of phenolics, probably because this species is genetically very close to 
 <italic>M. aquatica</italic> [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In general, values in the present study corresponded with those found in the literature, although differences could be attributed to environmental, phenological, and genetic factors. For example, plants of Mediterranean origin, in general, possess higher amounts of phenolics in comparison to the same species grown under continental conditions (
