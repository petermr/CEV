<p>To go further in the evaluation regarding how essential oil composition could be used as a chemotype marker in 
 <italic>Mentha</italic>, two more heatmaps were prepared. As before, the levels of the essential oil components and terpenoids were transformed using the log10 and the number of clusters using the silhouette method in RStudio. Only compounds whose levels were &gt;5% of the oil were used in this analysis. However, for these type of compounds, there was not a clear clustering of the 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> sp., mainly because both the compounds and their levels were different for most of the thirteen evaluated species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00550-f004">Figure 4</xref>). For example, it can be seen that the 
 <italic>M. piperita</italic> sp. in this case were not clustered all together but in very distant ones when the headspace samples were analyzed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00550-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). Similar results were obtained for the essential oils (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00550-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). However, the rest of the clusters were similar between both heat-maps. For example, 
 <italic>M. villosa</italic>, 
 <italic>M. microphylla,</italic> and 
 <italic>M. arvensis</italic> were sub-clustered together, and 
 <italic>M. suaveolens</italic> and 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic> formed another sub-cluster close to them (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00550-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The fact that 
 <italic>M. microphylla</italic> was clustered with different 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> species when the terpenoids or phenols were analyzed pointed to a combination of both as the best strategy to construct the chemotype in mint plants.
