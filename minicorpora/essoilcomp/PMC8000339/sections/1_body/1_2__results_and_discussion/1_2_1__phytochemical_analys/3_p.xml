<p>In general, solid conclusions on the available literature data face obstacles caused by methodology problems, such as missing information on the definition of the analyzed plant organ and the phenological stage of the plant. Nevertheless, previous studies confirmed that 
 <italic>M. cervina</italic> possesses the lowest values in total phenolic content, while 
 <italic>M. aquatica</italic> possesses the highest. The biggest variations were found for 
 <italic>M. x piperita</italic>, which was expected because there are more different cultivars of this species included in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00550-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Moreover, this study showed that the alcoholic extract of 
 <italic>M. suaveolens</italic> possesses the highest amounts of phenolic compounds, while, according to the available literature, 
 <italic>M. suaveolens</italic> from Slovakia [
 <xref rid="B56-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] is not as rich as the one investigated here. Therefore, a comparison of the chemical content of biologically active compounds in different species of the same genus, such as phenolics, should be performed for plants that are grown under the same environmental conditions and harvested at the same phenological stage.
