<p>Considering the essential oil composition, plants of the genus 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> show great chemical polymorphism, both intra- and inter-species. Many factors interfere with essential oil composition, including environmental, phenological, the plant part used for essential oil extraction, and the freshness of the material. [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This fact makes the need to using complementary compounds such as phenolics for a better characterization of 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> sp. more important. Additionally, in the presented work, some of the investigated species showed the same or similar chemical composition of essential oils when compared with those found in the literature, namely 
 <italic>M. aquatica</italic> [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B60-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,
 <xref rid="B61-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], 
 <italic>M. cervina</italic> [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B62-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], 
 <italic>M. suaveolens</italic> [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B63-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], 
 <italic>M. x piperita</italic> [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B60-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B60-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], and 
 <italic>M. x villosa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B60-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The major volatiles of 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic> are mainly carvone (CAR) and PUL [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] but the oil of the species studied here was of the piperitenone oxide (PIPOX) chemotype. This chemotype was also found in Greece [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Among the thirteen species investigated in this study, three new chemotypes were not described in the literature previously. The oil of the 
 <italic>M. arvensis</italic> studied here was of the carvone/limonene chemotype, while the same species of European origin is usually of the piperitone/myrcene chemotype [
 <xref rid="B16-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. On the contrary, menthol is the main compound of the oil obtained from South American 
 <italic>M. arvensis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. 
 <italic>Mentha longifolia</italic> was characterized as 1,8-cineole/Î³-terpinene chemotype (CIN/TERP) with significant amounts of aromatic phenol THY (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-10-00550">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). The oil of 
 <italic>M. longifolia</italic> shows a high variability [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B60-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], so discovering new chemotypes of this species is not unusual. Additionally, the 
 <italic>M. microphylla</italic> studied here was of the CAR chemotype (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-10-00550">Supplementary Table S32</xref>). On the contrary, to the best of our knowledge, there are just two records of the essential oil composition of 
 <italic>M. microphylla</italic>, from Greece [
 <xref rid="B64-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] and Italy [
 <xref rid="B65-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], and both of them were of the PIPOX chemotype.
