<p>Since the quality of these aromatic species is mainly characterized by the composition of their essential oils, dried plant material was subjected to static headspace analysis and hydro-distillation for the isolation of the essential oils. The percentage contents of both headspace and essential oil analyzed via GC–MS are summarized in

 <italic>Mentha</italic> volatiles are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-10-00550">Supplementary Table S3</xref>. The major classes of headspaces and essential oils in all investigated species were monoterpene hydrocarbons, such as limonene (LIM), γ-terpinene (TERP), and oxygenated monoterpenes (i.e., 1,8-cineole (CIN), linalool acetate (LINAC), pulegone (PUL), piperitenone (PIP), and piperitenone oxide (PIPOX)), and significant amounts of the volatile phenol thymol (THY) were found in the oil of
