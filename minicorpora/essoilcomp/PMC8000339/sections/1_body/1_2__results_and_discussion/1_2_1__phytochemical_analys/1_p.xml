<p>The total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) of the methanolic extracts of examined mints were firstly assayed spectrophotometrically. These preliminary results presented general differences in phenolic contents between investigated species. Values of gallic acid equivalents (GAEs) for the total phenolic content and quercetin equivalents (QEs) for flavonoid content are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-10-00550">Supplementary Table S1</xref>. The lowest values for both total phenolics and flavonoids were found in the extract of 
 <italic>Mentha cervina</italic> (14.81 ± 1.09 mg GAE/g and 3.65 ± 0.037 mg QE/g), while the extract of 
 <italic>Mentha suaveolens</italic> was found to be richest in total phenolics (58.93 ± 8.39 mg GAE/g) and 
 <italic>M. longifolia</italic> was found to be richest in flavonoids (16.83 ± 1.45 mg QE/g).
