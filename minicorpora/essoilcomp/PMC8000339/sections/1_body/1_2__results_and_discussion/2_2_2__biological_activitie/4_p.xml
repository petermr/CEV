<p>Additionally, essential oils possess notable antioxidant activities, although only the oil of 
 <italic>M. longifolia</italic> contains strong antioxidant thymol (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-10-00550">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). The antioxidant activity of the oils was in a wider range than their corresponding methanolic extracts (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00550-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), which was in agreement with the fact that essential oils of the investigated 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> species were much more diverse in their composition than their corresponding methanolic extracts. The highest antioxidant activity was recorded in the essential oil of 
 <italic>M. aquatica</italic> (43.86 ± 0.33 mg TE/mL) and 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> (40.01 ± 0.86 mg TE/mL), while 
 <italic>M. piperita var. citrata</italic> had the lowest activity (2.71 ± 0.34 mg TE/mL). This could be explained by the fact that these oils contain significant amounts of strong radical scavengers, pulegone, 1,8-cineole, and menthone [
