<p>Methanolic extracts and essential oils of all 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> species were able to reduce stable DPPH radical into its neutral form. The results, shown as Trolox equivalents per g of the dry extract, are summarized in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00550-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, and they ranged from 22.79 ± 1.85 mg TE/g (
 <italic>M. cervina</italic>) to 106.04 ± 3.26 mg TE/g (
 <italic>M. x villosa</italic>). It is well known that phenolic compounds from mints (but also from other plants) are the main carriers of antioxidant activities in alcoholic and aqueous plant extracts [

The Pearson correlation coefficient between total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of the methanolic extracts was 0.8307, while between total flavonoid content and antioxidant activity, it was slightly lower, i.e., 0.7105. The highest content of total phenolics was determined in the samples of 
 <italic>M. suaveolens</italic>, 
 <italic>M. x villosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>M. x piperita</italic> Bergamot (
