There are very strong positive correlations with the contents of the linalool (LIN), LINAC, and TIA of the oils. However, essential oils are very complex mixtures, and it is difficult to define whether their activity is based on the complex composition and potentially synergistic effect(s) of individual compounds present in each sample. Therefore, it has been suggested that the inhibitory activity of such complex mixtures cannot be easily explained by a few major compounds [
