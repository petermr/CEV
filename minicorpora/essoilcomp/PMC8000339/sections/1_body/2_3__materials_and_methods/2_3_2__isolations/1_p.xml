<p>Phenolic compounds were isolated from 50 mg of dry leaves, which were pulverized in an MM 400 mixer mill (Retch, Germany). After the addition of 1 mL of 80% methanol (Sigma Aldrich, Czechia), samples were sonicated at room temperature for 10 min. Following centrifugation at 12,400 rcf for 5 min, the supernatant was transferred into another vial, and re-extraction was performed, again using 1 mL of 80% methanol. Extracts were stored at −20 °C until analysis. Each extract was isolated in triplicate.</p>
