<p>Flavonoid content was estimated via the spectrophotometric method of Nagy and Grancai [
 <xref rid="B72-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. The data were calculated according to a standard curve of quercetin (1–50 μg/mL) and expressed as quercetin equivalents (QE) per gram of dry weight. Methanolic extracts (10–50 μL) were mixed with 500 μL of 2% aluminum chloride and 200 μL of a 1 M potassium acetate solution. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the absorbance was spectrophotometrically measured at 765 nm (Spectrophotometer UV/VIS S-20, Boeco, Germany) against a blank. All measurements were performed in triplicate.
