 <italic>Mentha</italic> species was directly collected via the static headspace method using a GC PAL autosampler 80 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a thermostated agitator and headspace syringe (maximum volume 2.5 mL). Dry and crushed plant material (5 g) was placed into a 20 mL headspace vial, which was shaken in an agitator at 40 °C. After incubation for 15 min, 1 mL of headspace was directly injected into the GC–MS instrument and analyzed as described before [
