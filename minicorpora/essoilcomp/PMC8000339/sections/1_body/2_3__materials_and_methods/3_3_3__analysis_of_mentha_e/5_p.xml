<p>The composition of essential oil constituents was analyzed via GC–MS using an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph fitted with a fused silica HP-5MS UI (5% phenyl methyl siloxane) capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness) coupled to an Agilent 5975C mass selective detector. All details about GC–MS conditions were described before [
 <xref rid="B70-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. The identification of the constituents was accomplished by visual interpretation, a comparison of their retention indices and mass spectra with literature data [
 <xref rid="B73-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], and a computer library search (Mass Finder 4 Computer Software). Briefly, the column temperature was set from 60 to 240 °C at a heating rate of 3 °C/min, and helium was used as carrier gas (1.1 mL/min). The other operating conditions were as follows: inlet pressure of 9.43 psi, injector temperature of 250 °C, detector temperature of 280 °C, split ratio for essential oils of 1:50, and injection volume of 1 μL. A mass selective detector was operated in the electron impact (EI) mode at an ionization energy of 70 eV, a scan range of 39–550 amu, and a scan time of 1.60 s. The linear retention indices (RI) for all compounds were determined by the Kovats method by the injection of homologous series of C8–C26
