<p>The radical scavenging ability of the isolated methanol extracts and essential oils was determined via the method of Brand-Williams et al. [
 <xref rid="B74-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], with slight modifications [
 <xref rid="B70-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. The results are presented as Trolox equivalents (TE) per dry weight of the methanolic extract or mL of the essential oil. Briefly, 50 μL of essential oil were dissolved in 950 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide, and the methanolic extracts were assayed without any further preparation. A portion of sample solution (50 μL) was mixed with 1 mL of 5.25 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup> M DPPH· in absolute ethanol. Absolute ethanol was used to zero the spectrophotometer; a DPPH· solution was used as the blank sample, and Trolox was used as a positive probe (calibration range of 0.01–0.25 mg/mL).
