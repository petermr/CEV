<p>The tyrosinase inhibitory activity of methanolic extracts and essential oils was measured according to the protocol of Saghaie et al. [
 <xref rid="B75-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] with some modifications. Details were described before [
 <xref rid="B70-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Results are presented as kojic acid equivalents (KAE) per dry weight of the methanolic extract or mL of the essential oil. Samples were prepared as described above. Briefly, the reaction mixture contained 600 μL of a phosphate buffer (20 mM and pH 6.8), 200 μL of a tyrosinase solution (46.5 U/mL), and 10 μL of a sample solution. After incubation at 25 °C for 10 min, a 100 µL L-DOPA (L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) solution (0.85 M) was added to the mixture and incubated at 25 °C for another 20 min, and absorbance at 492 nm was read. The blank sample consisted of 800 μL of a phosphate buffer and 200 μL of a tyrosinase solution. The measurements were performed in triplicate.
