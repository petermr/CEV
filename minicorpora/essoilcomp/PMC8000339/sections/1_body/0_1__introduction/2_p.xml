Mint is mainly cultivated for its essential oils (which are used as flavoring agents, beverage bases, and bee pasture plants) but can be interesting as ornamental plant [

 <xref rid="B9-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Demand for mint and its products continues to steadily rise, driven by the worldwide growth of a broad category of fast-moving consumer goods in which mint is used in cosmetics for the production of toothpaste, mouthwashes, shampoos, shaving creams, etc. Both extracts and essential oils show a broad spectrum of activities that are beneficial to humans. Due to their natural origin and bioactivities, mint-derived products could become a great alternative to artificial preservatives and could find a wide range of applications for the shelf-life extension of foods [

 <italic>Mentha</italic> plants are related to volatile monoterpenes 
 <italic>p</italic>-menthane and carvone, as well as their derivatives. These oxygenated monoterpenoids are responsible for the specific aroma and taste of different mint species [

 <xref rid="B11-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Moreover, there are dozens of commercial bile ducts, gastrointestinal and liver remedies, hypnotics, sedatives, and laxatives, which include extracts of different 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B9-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The major constituents of herbal infusions and alcoholic extracts are non-volatile, polar phenylpropanoids, mainly phenolic acids such as rosmarinic (RA) and chlorogenic (ChA) acid, but also in flavonoids such as apigenin (API) and luteolin (LUT) [
