<p>The quality control of plant foods has increased in many fields of food science and technology because the introduction of modern chromatographic techniques, like gas and liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry detectors, can provide the detailed chemical composition of complex matrixes in a very short time [
 <xref rid="B24-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Therefore, this study aimed to assess and compare the detailed phenolic composition of commercially important mint species of European origin that were grown under the same environmental conditions (continental climate with warm, dry summers and fairly cold winters). Additionally, profiles of volatile compounds were acquired and compared with literature data. Finally, the antioxidant and tyrosinase inhibition activities of isolated essential oils and methanolic extracts were assayed.
