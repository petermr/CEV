<p>Phenolic compounds belong to the most frequent and widespread groups of plant metabolites, with more than 8000 identified structures to date. The importance of plant phenolics (flavonoids, phenolic acids, etc.) is widely known in human health care. These bioactive plant secondary metabolites have been an inexhaustible source of scientific research, including their isolation from plant extracts, the assessment of their chemical structure, and the characterization of a wide array of biological properties [

Since ancient times, the human race has been exploring the potential of plants to improve their health, often attributed to the presence of phenolic compounds with strong antioxidant properties. The antioxidant ability of phenolic components occurs mainly through a redox mechanism and allows the components to act as reducing agents, hydrogen donors, singlet oxygen quenchers, and metal chelators [

Therefore, plant phenolics are beneficial because they not only conserve the quality of plant-based food and food products but also reduce the risk of the development of some human disorders, such as cardiovascular diseases, arteriosclerosis, cancer, diabetes, cataract, disorders of cognitive function, and neurological diseases [
