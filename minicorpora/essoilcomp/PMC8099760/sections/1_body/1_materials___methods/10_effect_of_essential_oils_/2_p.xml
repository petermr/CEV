<p id="p0130">Inhibition of β-lactamase in bacterial cultures was studied as per the procedure of Bush and Bradfold [
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Whatman No. 1 filter paper strips (7 × 4mm) were soaked in 1% starch solution, dried and resoaked in ampicillin solution for 10′ and spread smoothly in a petridish. 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> HB101 treated with the test compounds at sub-inhibitory concentrations for overnight were streaked on nutrient agar plate, and incubated for 24 h for colony development. Colonies were transferred to the surface of starch- ampicillin paper strips and were spread over an area of 2–3 mm, then incubated at 37 °C for 30′ to facilitate the production of enzyme stained with Gram's iodine solution for 30 s and checked for the presence/absence of the zone of decolorization around the culture streak.
