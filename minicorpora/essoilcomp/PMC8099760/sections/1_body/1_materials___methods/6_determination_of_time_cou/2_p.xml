 <italic>oryzae</italic> &amp; 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>) were treated with test compounds at MBC values. At regular time intervals, aliquots of treated culture were drawn, diluted appropriately and plated on nutrient agar/sucrose peptone agar for colony development. The number of colonies was counted, and the number of viable cells was estimated.
