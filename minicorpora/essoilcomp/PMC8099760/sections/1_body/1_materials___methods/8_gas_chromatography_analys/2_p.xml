<p id="p0120">The five essential oils viz., lemon grass, palm rosa, eucalyptus, geranium, citronella were chromatographed using a Varian star CP 3800 gas chromatograph equipped with a ZB wax capillary column (30 m length x 0.25 mm i.d. x 0.25 μdf), FID, ECD and PFPD with auto sampler. The carrier gas was helium, by a rate of 1 ml/min. The make up gas was helium and make up flow was 25 ml/min. Air flow was kept at 300 ml/min. The FID temperature was 250 °C (range-12), and the injector temperature was 225 °C (split ratio-100:5). Column temperature was initially kept for 2 min at 70 °C, and was then gradually increased at a rate of 5 °C/min to 275 °C and held for 12min. Total run time was 55min [
