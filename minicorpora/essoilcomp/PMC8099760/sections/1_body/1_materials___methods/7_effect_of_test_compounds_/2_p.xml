<p id="p0115">The antibacterial activity of the essential oils and their major components on drug resistant pathogenic bacteria was tested by filter paper disc method [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Actively growing log phase cultures were mixed in soft agar (nutrient broth with 1% agar) and plated. Two different dilutions of the essential oils and their major components were used for testing the antibacterial efficacy. The essential oils and their major components were loaded onto to filter paper discs prepared from Whatman No. 1 filter paper. The discs were then placed on the agar medium containing the culture, and incubated for 24 h at 37 Â°C. The diameter of zone of growth inhibition was recorded. The same procedure was followed to screen the antibacterial activity of essential oils and their major components against non-pathogenic bacteria initially.
