<p id="p0100">Test compounds in 1% Tween 20 solution were added in to the nutrient broth and thoroughly shaken. Two-fold serial dilution of the test compound was carried out in the nutrient broth/sucrose peptone broth. To each test tube 104–105 cells/ml of actively growing bacterial culture in log phase was inoculated. The culture tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 24h and at 28 °C for 48h in case of plant pathogenic bacteria. After the incubation, a loop full of these treated cultures was streaked on the nutrient agar/sucrose peptone agar plates. The plates were incubated and were checked for the growth of bacteria, and the Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) of each test compound was determined. The MBC was expressed in μl/ml (v/v).</p>
