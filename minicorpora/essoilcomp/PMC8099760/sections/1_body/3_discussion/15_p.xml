<p id="p0360">Though the results on sensitization of bacteria were not encouraging, the studies on development of resistance by 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> to the essential oils were encouraging. The bacterium was not found to develop any resistance against the test compounds even after 30 passages in presence of sub lethal concentrations of the test compounds. These developments and the associated increase in fungal infections of animals and plants intensified the search for new, safer, and more efficacious agents to combat serious fungal infections. The crop losses due to fungal infections are enormous which led to indiscriminate use of synthetic fungicides. Moreover most of the studies on essential oils were done on their antibacterial activity. This prompted us to study the efficacy of the test compounds for their antifungal activity. For our studies we have selected plant pathogenic fungi as the losses due to fungi is seen more in agriculture. One interesting thing here is that from among the compounds tested, lemon grass oil and citral were the best antibacterial and antifungal agents. Palm rosa which was next to lemon grass in antibacterial activity showed lesser anti fungal activity than eucalyptus oil. Geranium essential oil could not show any zone of inhibition at 4μl/disc concentration against all the tested fungi, except 
 <italic>M. grisea</italic>. Tagetus and mentha oils showed very poor anti fungal activity.
