<p id="p0330">Among the three major components, citral showed the best antibacterial activity. The results from the disc diffusion assay and liquid culture assay indicate that citral could be the main antibacterial component of the lemon grass essential oil. The antibacterial activity of palm rosa oil was found to be greater than that of geraniol. In contrast to this, essential oil of citronella, showed less antibacterial activity than geraniol. These two observations suggest two things which needs to be tested further thoroughly 1) In palm rosa in addition to geraniol some other components might be acting synergistically against the bacteria, and 2) In citronella oil geraniol is present up to 29%, and it could be that this is the only component which is showing antibacterial activity, while the rest of the components are either not showing any antibacterial activity or show only weak antibacterial activity.</p>
