<p id="p0365">In conclusion, the essential oils of lemongrass, palm rosa and eucalyptus were found to be good antimicrobial agents. Next, we planned to study the ability of these essential oils in controlling the plant diseases caused by bacteria and fungi. Till now most of the work on the antimicrobial effects of essential oils has been performed on human pathogens, spoilage microorganisms, and dermatophytes, with very little research on phytopathogenic microorganism, both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Hence we further examined the effect of these compounds against phytopathogens 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. The 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> results show that these compounds are active against 
 <italic>X. oryzae</italic> and 
 <italic>M. grisea</italic> and hence we studied the ability of these compounds to control blight and blast diseases of rice.
