<p id="p0300">In the present study, we have studied the antimicrobial properties of seven essential oils, and their major components. Initially we have screened the antimicrobial activity of the test essential oils and their major components using paper disc assays. However, using the size of inhibition zone to indicate relative antimicrobial activity of essential oil and its constituents is not adequate. The zone of inhibition may be altered by the solubility and rate of diffusion of the test compounds in agar medium. Moreover, evaporation of the essential oils and their constituents can affect the doses applied to paper discs and thus the results. Hence we have determined the relative antimicrobial activity of the test compounds using liquid culture assay by determining their minimum inhibitory concentrations. Based on paper disc assay the most effective antibacterial essential oil is lemongrass followed by palmrosa, eucalyptus and geranium. Our liquid culture assays also specify the same.</p>
