<p id="p0345">The major component of palm rosa i.e. Geraniol showed higher antibacterial activity than chloramphenicol against all the bacteria tested, except against 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. The essential oil of eucalyptus showed higher antibacterial activity compared to chloramphenicol. From the above studies it can be clearly understood that among the various essential oils tested for antibacterial activity lemon grass oil, followed by its major component citral, palm rosa oil, eucalyptus oil showed highest bactericidal activity in that order. Studies on the time course of lethal action were carried out on 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>X. oryzae</italic>. The results indicate that the lethal rate by lemon grass oil, palm rosa oil and citral was comparable with ampicillin against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. Against 
 <italic>X. oryzae,</italic> eucalyptus oil was very quick in its action though its antibacterial activity was less compared to lemon grass, palm rosa and ampicillin. One interesting observation from these studies is that, in general the essential oils are very quick in their action against the Gram + bacteria, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> than Gram - bacteria. This could be due to the higher tolerance to lipophilic compounds shown by the outer membrane of Gram - bacteria as suggested by Heipieper et al., [
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and Sikkema 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, [
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This might be playing a role in slower action of essential oils against Gram - bacteria in terms of time taken for total inhibition.
