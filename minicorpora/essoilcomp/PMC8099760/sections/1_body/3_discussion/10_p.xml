<p id="p0335">Two methods were trialed to determine the antimicrobial activity of essential oils and their major components. The disc diffusion assay and serial dilution assay were used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations of the test compounds. Both the assays showed that lemon grass oil has a broad spectrum of inhibitory activity. From the results it could be observed that the bactericidal activity of the essential oil was higher than their major components suggesting the role of other components of oils in antimicrobial activity. This was in contrast to the results of [
