<p id="p0205">For comparison purpose, the minimum bactericidal concentrations in μg/ml (w/v) of some commonly used antibiotics 
 <italic>viz.</italic>, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol was determined and the results are presented in 
 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. The antibacterial activity of the antibiotics, the three essential oils viz. lemon grass, palm rosa, eucalyptus and their major components viz. citral, geraniol and citronellal was compared and illustrated in Figures 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, and 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. From the results it is clear that among the essential oils under investigation the best oils in terms of antibacterial activity are lemon grass, palm rosa and eucalyptus oils (
