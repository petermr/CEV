<p id="p0260">Five of the seven essential oils viz. lemon grass, palm rosa, eucalyptus, geranium and citronella showed antifungal activity against all the four fungi tested (
 <xref rid="tbl10" ref-type="table">Table 10</xref>). Further, it was observed that essential oils of lemon grass and eucalyptus showed delayed sporulation started at the end of 7th and 6th day respectively in 
 <italic>A. Niger</italic>, compared to control where, sporulation started by the end of the fourth day. The two essential oils of tagetus and mentha did not inhibit 
 <italic>A. niger</italic>, 
 <italic>F. udum</italic> and 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>. However, these two essential oils showed antifungal activity against 
 <italic>M. Grisea</italic> Among all these, lemon grass oil was the most potent one in terms of inhibiting the growth of fungi around the disc loaded with this oil (
