<p>There were two types of samples injected, standard citronellal compound and KLL essential oil. The standard compound was used to make regression curves for estimating citronellal concentration in essential oils. Regression curves were composed of 10 concentrations of standard citronellal compound, i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10%. To prepare 1% standard solution, about 10 μL of standard citronellal solution was needed and then ethyl acetate (990 μL) was added to form 1 mL of the final solution. Citronellal samples in 1 mL vials were then vortexed for forming homogeneous samples and then injected into GCMS. The GCMS analysis resulted in the peak area of the citronellal compound (X) and then regressed with the level of concentration of standard citronellal solution (Y). Regression equation in the standard curve could be used to estimate absolute citronellal content in essential oils of KLL.</p>
