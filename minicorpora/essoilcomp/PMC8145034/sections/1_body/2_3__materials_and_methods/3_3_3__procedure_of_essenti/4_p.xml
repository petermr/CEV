<p>Essential oil samples were taken as much as 100 μL and then ethyl acetate (900 μL) added to form a 1 mL sample solution (10 × dilution factor). There were three replications for every growing location. The sample was then vortexed to form a homogeneous solution before GCMS injection. The peak area of citronellal produced by GCMS was used as mathematical input in the regression equation that has been produced to calculate the absolute citronellal content in the kaffir lime essential oil samples. Also, the results of GCMS analysis could also be used to determine relative levels of other compounds. The relative content of citronellol, linalool and caryophyllene was determined based on these compounds’ peak area expressed in percent of the total area of the chromatogram peak.</p>
