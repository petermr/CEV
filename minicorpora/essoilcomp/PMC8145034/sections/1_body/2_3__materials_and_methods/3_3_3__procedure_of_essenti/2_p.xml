<p>Determination of citronellal content and relative content of citronellol, linalool and caryophyllene was carried out using the instrument of Agilent 7890 gas chromatography- tandem to 5975 mass spectrometry (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA), with 1 µL injection volume in the split mode (a split ratio 10:1). The column used was Agilent 19091N-133HP-INNOWax Polyethylene Glyco with dimensions of size 30 m (length) × 250 μm (diameter) × 0.25 μm (thickness). The carrier gas used was helium (mobile phase) with a constant flow mode and a flow velocity of 0.9 µL per minute and a column pressure of 7.06 psi. The column temperature was programmed from 60 °C to 210 °C, with an increased stage of (i) 2 °C per minute to 150 °C and then maintained for 1 min at 150 °C; and (ii) 20 °C per minute to 210 °C and then maintained for 10 min at 210°C. The injector temperature during the analysis was programmed constant at 230 °C.</p>
