<p>About 3 kg of KLL were harvested in every location and were immediately packaged in a closed container equipped with a cooling gel and then sent to the laboratory within the same day. Samples were withered for two days before distillation. Water-steam distillation was carried out in every kilogram of KLL by using a stainless steel distillery kettle for about 3 h. Essential oil was dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate and then the volume was measured, after which the oil was stored in dark glass bottles for further testing purposes.</p>
