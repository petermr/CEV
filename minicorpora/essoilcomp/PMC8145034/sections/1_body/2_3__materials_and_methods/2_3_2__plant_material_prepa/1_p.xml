Monthly and annual climatic data collection is relatively more accurate in describing land conditions and their effect to plant growth, especially for an annual plant, such as kaffir lime. The oldest and youngest fully developed leaves harvested in each tree were around 1-year-old and 1-month-old, respectively. Tulungagung KLL were harvested from 1.5-year-old plants that were planted in the monoculture garden owned by the local community. West Bandung KLL were harvested from 2-year-old plants, which are intercropped with leafy vegetables in the community’s vegetable garden. Pasuruan KLL were harvested from 2.5-year-old plants that are planted in the residents’ backyard. Bogor KLL were harvested from 1.5-year-old plants arranged in the monoculture system at Pasir Kuda IPB experimental station.
