<p>Four different growing locations with variations in terms of altitude, agroclimatic conditions (temperature and rainfall), soil nutrient status (pH, C-organic, N, P, K) and leaves nutrient status (C-organic, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn) clearly influenced the yield and main composition of the essential oils of KLL. The yield was positively correlated with rainfall, C-organic status, soil pH and leaves nutrient levels of N, P, and Mg. As the main constituent of KLL essential oils, the absolute content of citronellal was positively correlated with soil actual pH and leaves Ca nutrient content. However, it was negatively correlated with Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu content in leaves. Other important constituents showed various results, i.e., (i) citronellol displayed a negative correlation to annual rainfall intensity, (ii) the increase of altitude was associated with the decrease of relative content of caryophyllene, and (iii) relative content of linalool was positively correlated with the K content of KLL.</p>
