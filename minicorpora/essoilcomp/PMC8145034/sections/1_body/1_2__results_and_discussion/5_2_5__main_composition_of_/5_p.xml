 <xref rid="B77-metabolites-11-00260" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] reported that the caryophyllene content in essential leaves of 
 <italic>Citrus hystrix</italic> and 
 <italic>Citrus x microcarpa</italic> was 0.9% and 2.8%, respectively. This study also noticed that the increased of altitude was likely associated with a decrease in the relative levels of caryophyllene. An earlier report stated that the intensification culture practice in the form of NPK fertilizer, vermicompost, and PSB biofertilizer could increase the caryophyllene relative content by about 24%, 180% and 124%, respectively [

The variation of the main constituent and yield of kaffir lime essential oil in the present experiment was confirmed the earlier hypothesis that essential oil yield and composition in aromatic plants may be varied in response to genotype, growing location and culture practices [
