<p>Growing locations significantly affected the relative content of citronellol of KLL essential oil (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00260-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Our work revealed that the citronellol content in four locations varied from 2.42% to 6.55%, with the highest coming from Tulungagung, while the lowest was from Pasuruan. Previous studies in different sites reported that the citronellol content in KLL essential oil was derived from Selangor, Melaka, and Terengganu, at 6.6%, 6.7% and 13.4%, respectively [
