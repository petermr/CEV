<p>In earlier studies, citronellal relative content in two cultivars of 
 <italic>Pelargonium graveolens</italic> was affected by the growing season, where the rainy season produced a higher result than during summer [
 <xref rid="B32-metabolites-11-00260" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In contrast, our finding showed a positive, strong (r 0.81) significant (α 1%) correlation between the citronellal content and soil actual pH, instead of climatic variables. Soil from Pasuruan has an actual pH that is closer to neutral (6.27) compared to acidic soil from West Bandung (4.76). Citrus generally grows optimally in slightly acidic to neutral soil due to the availability of more balanced macro and micronutrients. Macronutrients, specifically leaf Ca content showed a positive, significant and strong (r 0.83) correlation to the citronellal content. Leaf micronutrient, i.e., Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, correlated significantly and negatively with citronellal content. The levels of leaf Mn and Fe in this experiment were proved to have negatively correlated with leaf N level (r −0.85 and r −0.80, respectively). However, the mechanism of the Ca, Fe, Mn, Cu, and Zn into citronellal biosynthesis in kaffir lime is still unclear.
