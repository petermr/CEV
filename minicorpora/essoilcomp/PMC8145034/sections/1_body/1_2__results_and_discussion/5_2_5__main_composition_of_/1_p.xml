 <xref rid="B78-metabolites-11-00260" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Citronellal is an economically important compound due to its use as an intermediate component in the synthesis of perfumes, drugs and basic ingredients for the synthesis of isopulegol, menthol and citronellol [
 <xref rid="B79-metabolites-11-00260" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. The pharmacological properties of this monoterpenoid aldehyde were anti-inflammatory [

 <xref rid="B81-metabolites-11-00260" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] and antifungal activities [
 <xref rid="B82-metabolites-11-00260" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Citronellal was the most dominant compound found in metabolites fingerprinting of KLL essential oils, with the relative concentration ranging from 61.7â€“74.8% [

 <xref rid="B84-metabolites-11-00260" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Our quantitative analysis approach revealed the absolute concentration of citronellal by using a mathematical equation (R
 <sup>2</sup> 0.9975) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00260-f002">Figure 2</xref>a). The absolute content of citronellal was significantly affected by the location (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00260-f002">Figure 2</xref>b). The order from the highest to the lowest citronellal yield was Pasuruan &gt; Bogor = Tulungagung &gt; West Bandung.
