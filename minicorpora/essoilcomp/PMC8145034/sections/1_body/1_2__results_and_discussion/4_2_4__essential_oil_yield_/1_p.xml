<p>Bogor kaffir lime leaves produced the highest yield of essential oils (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00260-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The lowest yield was noticed in KLL from Tulungagung and West Bandung. The yield showed a positive, strong (r 0.83) and significant (Î± 1%) correlation to annual rainfall of the locations (
 <xref rid="metabolites-11-00260-t009" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>). The higher intensity of rainfall in Bogor supported kaffir lime to have greater essential oil production. Water sufficiency was thought to have a beneficial effect on essential oil production of kaffir lime. It was reported that water insufficient conditions decreased the essential oil yield of
