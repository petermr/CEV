<p>The present study displayed a significantly different result among four locations on plant macronutrient status, except for C-organic (
 <xref rid="metabolites-11-00260-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). The N total of KLL from Bogor and Pasuruan was significantly higher than samples from West Bandung and Tulungagung. Based on the plant nutrient adequacy standard for fruit-oriented citrus [
 <xref rid="B39-metabolites-11-00260" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], the N total from Bogor and Pasuruan was classified as optimum, whereas West Bandung and Tulungagung were categorized as low. The N status on the citrus plant should be well monitored since the N plays an important role for citrus plant, i.e., enhance vegetative growth, increase tree productivity, and modulate citrus fruit sugar and organic acid content [
