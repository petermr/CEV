<p>The calcium (Ca) content of KLL was significantly affected by locations, but no significant correlation to agroclimatic and edaphic variables. KLL sample of low land (Tulungagung and Bogor) had a significantly higher sulfur (S) than sample of high land (Pasuruan and West Bandung). However, a previous study reported an insignificant increase of S uptake as the increase of altitude from 1487 to 2569 m asl [
