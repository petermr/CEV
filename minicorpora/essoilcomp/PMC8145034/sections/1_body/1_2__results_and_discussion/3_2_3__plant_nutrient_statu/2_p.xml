<p>The P total of KLL from West Bandung and Tulungagung was the lowest, while it was the highest for Bogor, followed by Pasuruan sample. Even though the West Bandung soil had the highest P (
 <xref rid="metabolites-11-00260-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), its leaf P content was the lowest (
 <xref rid="metabolites-11-00260-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>), assumed to the incidence of less available P for the plant due to the acidic soil. In contrast, the relative neutral soil pH condition in Bogor supported the adequate absorption of P. The P is an important element and is needed for the formation of nucleic acid, phospholipid components, and ATP [

 <xref rid="B44-metabolites-11-00260" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], because this element is involved in numerous processes, i.e., carbohydrates metabolism, enzyme activation and protein synthesis [

 <sup>+</sup> ion was a prerequisite for plants for the process of sugar translocation, starch formation, stomatal opening regulation, and fruit quality improvement [
