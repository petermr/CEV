 <xref rid="B32-metabolites-11-00260" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] proved that different seasons produce different yields and composition of essential oil. Evaluation of the seasonal climatic effect on the essential oil of rose-scented geranium reported that rainy and autumn support better plant growth and higher oil yield [

Unfortunately, there is still limited study related to the yield and quality of kaffir lime essential oils in response to growing locations. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the relationship among agroclimatic variables, soil-plant nutrient status to the KLL essential oil yield and main composition.
