<p>The increased production of raw materials for kaffir lime essential oil can be pursued through both extensification and intensification programs. The main principle of extensification is the cropland expansion, while the core of intensification is the improvement of input, i.e., plant materials, mechanization, fertilizer, irrigation, and pest control [

The extensification of kaffir lime should be arranged based on a deep understanding of how climate and soil impact the yield and quality of the product. However, in Asia, there is a tendency to transition from extensification to intensification due to the lack of cropland under a high density of population [

In the case of intensification, the determination of addressed input should be directed to the essential oil orientation and specific to location, since the determination of the best growing location is one of the agricultural innovations required in natural product development [
