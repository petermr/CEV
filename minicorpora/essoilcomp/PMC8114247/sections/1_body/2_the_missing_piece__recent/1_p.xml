<p>The antimicrobial activities of essential oils due to membrane disruption and efflux inhibition have been well reported. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of knowledge of the underlying mechanism that confers these effects. Recent advances in genomic and proteomic methods, such as comparative gene expression, microarray, and comparative proteomic analysis, may provide the key missing piece to elucidate and explain the mode of action of essential oils.</p>
