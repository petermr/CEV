<p>Essential oils serve as a good platform for the discovery of novel compounds that can be used in clinical settings. Nonetheless, the clinical approval milestone for utilization as an antimicrobial has not been met. It is mainly due to the complexity of the composition of each essential oil. Essential oils consist of a collection of different chemical compounds, ranging from terpenes and terpenoids to aromatic compounds. The essential oils of different plants also have a completely different composition and do not function the same way. For instance, cinnamon bark and lavender essential oil have completely different compositions as determined in previous studies.

 </sup> Moreover, the same essential oil harvested from different regions can often result in different compositions, resulting in inconsistent therapeutic values. Besides, some of these compounds are often toxic in limited quantities and may not be completely appropriate for clinical use.
