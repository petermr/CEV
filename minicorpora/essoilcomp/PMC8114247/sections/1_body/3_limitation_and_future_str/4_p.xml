<p>To further study the mode of action of essential oils, both proteomic and genomic methodologies can be combined and analyzed. Proteomic analysis reveals the changes in the proteome profile, while genomic analysis reveals changes in the genetic transcript of essential oil-treated cells. This helps systems biology to understand whether essential oils may alter the gene expression that eventually affects protein expression or only the protein directly. Specialized software that allows the combinatory analysis of both the microarray and the proteomic profile of essential oil-treated cells can also be applied. This would facilitate the analysis and comparison of the proteomic and genomic profiles of the cells treated with different crude essential oils and the single compound-treated profiles from the same oil, thereby facilitating the elucidation of the mode of action of the compound.</p>
