<p>Future research should focus on the identification of novel compounds responsible for the mode of action of essential oils to minimize toxicity. This includes the assessment of antimicrobial efficacy, mode of action for elucidation using genomic and proteomic perspective, and biochemical assays. Antimicrobial efficacy includes the ability of the compound to exhibit antimicrobial activity on its own and the possibility that the compound may exhibit synergy with the combination of existing antibiotics. This will revive previously dormant antibiotics for combination therapy. Besides, a thorough toxicity study of potential substances, including human cell line toxicity tests and animal studies, should be performed. Human clinical trials will finally be feasible.</p>
