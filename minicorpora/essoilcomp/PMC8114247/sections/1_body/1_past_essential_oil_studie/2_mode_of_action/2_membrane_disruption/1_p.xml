<p>Bacterial membrane plays an important role in the regulation of cellular osmotic pressure and the influx and efflux of biomolecules. Thus, a compromised membrane will disrupt osmotic pressure, leading to intracellular leakage and eventually destroy the cell. One of the main postulated modes of action of essential oil is its ability to disrupt bacterial membranes. In their work on the bactericidal effect of tea tree oil against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, Cox et al demonstrated that cells treated with tea tree oil have higher fluorescence under propidium iodide (PI) staining, and increased intracellular material leakage and potassium ion efflux. All of these indicated a potential disruption of the bacterial membrane.

 </sup> It is noteworthy that PI stains the genetic materials of the cell membrane of the compromised bacterial cells whereas the intracellular material leakage and potassium ion efflux assay detect the leakage of intracellular materials, such as genetic materials, proteins, and potassium ions, in the event of membrane disruption. Moreover, Yap et al

 </sup> investigated the antimicrobial activity and mode of action of lavender essential oil against antibiotic-resistant 
 <italic>E. coli.</italic> Their study showed that lavender essential oil affects the membrane zeta potential of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> cells after exposure. Membrane zeta potential reveals the surface charge of the bacterial membrane and a change in the value is associated with membrane disruption. Furthermore, the permeability of the cell membrane has also increased, as shown in the outer membrane permeability assay using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as a membrane-disrupting probe. Their study was validated by the microscopic analysis of the 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> treated with lavender essential oil, in which the disruption of cell structure and morphology was visualized.

 <italic>E. coli</italic>. The study reported changes in the membrane potential of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> cells following treatment with black pepper essential oil. The intracellular leakage was also observed in the cells following treatment with black pepper oil and the cell membrane disruption was further validated via scanning electron microscopy.

 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> by disrupting their bacterial membrane. The membrane disruption was assessed by measurement of zeta potential, outer membrane permeability and scanning electron microscopy.
