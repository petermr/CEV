<p>Antimicrobial activities of essential oils have been widely reported. However, the mode of action of these essential oils is still unclear. Traditionally, the mode of action of essential oils was inferred mainly based on biochemical assays. Due to technical limitations, these assays are generally poor in the identification of exact causes or pathways leading to antimicrobial effects. Nonetheless, an essential oil is believed to have a structural impact on the bacterial membrane and its transport system.</p>
