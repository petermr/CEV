<p>Another postulated mode of action of essential oil is its ability to inhibit the bacterial efflux system. The bacterial efflux system comprises of specialized channel proteins located on the bacterial membrane, which are crucial for the removal of harmful compounds such as antibiotics from the intracellular environment. The efflux system can be divided into several categories, ranging from being compound-specific to universal pumps that allow bacteria to survive in the presence of antimicrobials. Inhibition of the activity of such pumps is of great importance in counteracting antibiotic resistance by reviving the efficacy of antibiotics. A previous study by Chovanov√° et al demonstrated efflux inhibition activity in essential oils extracted from three 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> species against antibiotic-resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermis</italic>. Using fluorescent spectrophotometry, all three essential oils were found to reduce the efflux activity of 
 <italic>S. epidermis</italic> upon exposure to essential oils.

 <italic>S. epidermis</italic> after treatment with essential oil.

 </sup> showed similar activity of efflux inhibition by eucalyptus essential oil against respiratory tract infection bacteria such as 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae, S. aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Moraxella catarrhalis</italic>. The group also assessed the efflux inhibition activity using Rhodamine 6G accumulation assay, in which the treated cells exhibited increased accumulation of Rhodamine 6G resulting in a faulty bacterial efflux system.

 </sup> In addition, De Morais Oliveira-Tintino et al also reported efflux inhibitory activity of essential oil from 
 <italic>Chenopodium ambrosioides</italic> L. against drug-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. The inhibitory activity was derived from the combined activity of antibiotic essential oil and ethidium bromide.

 </sup> Interestingly, the essential oil alone showed no antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, whereas essential oil combined with antibiotics significantly reduces the effective dose of antibiotics, resulting in a synergistic effect between essential oils and antibiotics.

 </sup> Recently, Espinoza et al
 <sup>
  <xref rid="bibr40-1176934320938391" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>
 </sup> demonstrated efflux inhibiting activity of heartwood essential oil in drug-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> with NorA multidrug efflux pump. The team performed ethidium bromide efflux assay against heartwood essential oil-treated 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells and found that treated cells had reduced efflux activity of ethidium bromide.
