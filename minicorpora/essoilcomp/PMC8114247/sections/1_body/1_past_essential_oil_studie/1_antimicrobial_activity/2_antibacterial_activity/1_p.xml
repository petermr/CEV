<p>The Kirby Bauer and broth microdilution assays are two of the most common methods used to evaluate the minimum inhibitory activity of essential oils. The Kirby Bauer assay uses disks infused with a known amount of potential antimicrobial to detect the bacterial susceptibility by measuring the inhibition zone produced. Broth microdilution, on the other hand, infuses varying concentrations of potential antimicrobial in the microculture while detecting the bacterial viability using resazurin, allowing a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to be determined.
