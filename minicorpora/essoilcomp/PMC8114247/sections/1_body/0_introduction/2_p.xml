 </sup> Essential oil is a concentrated plant secondary metabolite composed of a mixture of chemical compounds ranging from terpenes and terpenoids to aromatic compounds that gives fragrance to a plant. Numerous studies have established the antimicrobial potential of essential oils against bacteria, fungi, and viruses.

 </sup> Most essential oils have been found to produce antibiotic effects by acting on the bacterial membrane and the efflux system.
