<p>Antibiotics have been used to treat bacterial infections for almost a century since the discovery of penicillin in 1928 by Alexander Fleming. The commercialization of penicillin in 1944 lowered the mortality statistics for those who have contracted bacterial infections. Over the years, diverse groups of antibiotics from different sources have been discovered, characterized, and applied in a clinical setting to offset antibiotic resistance. However, newer resistance mechanisms have consistently emerged almost in tandem with the discovery of a novel antimicrobial. In recent years, the rate of novel antimicrobial discovery has substantially decreased. This decline can be attributed to the failure of current antibiotic discovery platforms in discovering novel high-efficacy antibiotics.

 </sup> Apart from this, new antibiotics are subjected to a complicated assessment of their overall toxicity and side effects, ranging from cell-line to animal studies and resulting in human clinical trials; all of these without the commercialization process. The combination of high investments, relatively short effective duration (due to resistance) and relatively low price compared to other drugs has made the development of antibiotics unappealing for the pharmaceutical industry.
