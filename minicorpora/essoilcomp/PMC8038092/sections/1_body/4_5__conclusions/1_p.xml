<p>This is the first study on composition and biological activity of the essential oils extracted from roots and aerial parts of 
 <italic>C. cernuum</italic> of European origin. The examined oils differed in composition and antibacterial activity. The essential oil from the plant roots was rich in thymol derivatives, especially thymohydroquinone dimethyl ether (2,5-dimethoxy-
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene) of proven antiviral activity (55% of oil). The essential oil from aerial parts, of very complex composition, was rich in 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene and demonstrated better antibacterial activity than that determined for the root essential oil. The oils at the concentrations ≥100 nL/mL were cytotoxic in vitro to both cancer and normal cell lines used in the study.
