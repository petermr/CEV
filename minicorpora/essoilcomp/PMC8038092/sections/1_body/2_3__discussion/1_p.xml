<p>The tribe Inuleae of the Compositae (Asteraceae) comprises 62 genera of flowering plants divided into the two subtribes: Inuleae-Inulinae and Inuleae-Plucheinae [

 <italic>Blumea</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Pulicaria</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Dittrichia</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>Inula</italic> spp. have been the most frequently studied taxa of the Inuleae-Inulinae in respect of the production, composition and biological activity of the essential oils. The genera 
 <italic>Carpesium</italic> and 
 <italic>Telekia</italic>, though belonging to the same clade as 
 <italic>Inula</italic>, are much less investigated. Only three papers on essential oils from 
 <italic>Carpesium</italic> spp. have been published to date [

 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-01883" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] provided inconsistent data on the composition of the essential oils from the herb. This might be either due to different provenience of the plant material or due to different experimental procedures applied. In total, 16 and 44 components of the oil were identified with, respectively, eudesma-5,11(13)-dien-8,12-olide and Î²-bisabolene as major constituents. Neither thymol nor its derivatives were mentioned as components of the

 <italic>abrotanoides</italic> essential oils. As a result of biological activity testing, induction of apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2) by 
 <italic>C. abrotanoides</italic> essential oil was experimentally proven [
