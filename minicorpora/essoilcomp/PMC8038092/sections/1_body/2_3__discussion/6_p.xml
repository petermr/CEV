<p>Antiseptic activity of compounds or essential oils should be associated with the lack of toxicity against human cells. Therefore, cytotoxicity of 
 <italic>C. cernuum</italic> essential oils was tested in vitro using keratinocytes and fibroblasts derived from the human skin. Our data showed higher safety of the examined essential oils over thymol. However, the essential oils from 
 <italic>C. cernuum</italic> were cytotoxic to the investigated cells in concentrations much lower (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 0.072–0.107 µL/mL; 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-01883-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) than those inhibiting bacterial growth (MIC: 12–250 µL/mL; 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-01883-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Finally, essential oils were tested in melanoma cell lines to assess anticancer activity. Unlike the essential oil from 
 <italic>C. abrotanoides</italic> [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-01883" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and essential oils from 
 <italic>A. montana</italic> [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-01883" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-01883" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], that demonstrated selective cytotoxicity against the cancer cells, 
 <italic>C. cernuum</italic> REO and APEO did not show selective cytotoxicity towards the cancer cell lines used in this study. Cytotoxic activity of thymol was slightly higher than those of the tested 
 <italic>C. cernuum</italic> oils. This result agrees with the previous study [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-26-01883" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], indicating moderate toxicity of thymol towards a melanoma cell line. Selectivity of the cytotoxic effect in experiments using other types of cells could not be excluded and is worth further studies.
