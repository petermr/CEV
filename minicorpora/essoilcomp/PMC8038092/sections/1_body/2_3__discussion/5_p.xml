<p>The development of new antibiotics remains an ongoing challenge. Plant essential oils, and some individual compounds contained in them, may display good antimicrobial activity themselves or they can act synergistically with the antibiotics currently used in the therapy [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-26-01883" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The essential oils distilled from dried roots and aerial parts of 
 <italic>C. cernuum</italic> were active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, though their activity in comparison with that of thymol, used as a reference compound, was low. The determined MICs (see 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-01883-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) were lower in the case of the essential oil obtained from the aerial parts of the plant. Thus, the simple positive correlation between thymol derivatives content or 2,5-dimethoxy-
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene content and the antibacterial activity of the oil should be excluded. It is worth to note that the activity of 
 <italic>C. cernuum</italic> APEO against the standard line of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> is equal to that against 
 <italic>S. aureus,</italic> a Gram-positive bacterium. 
 <italic>C. cernuum</italic> REO was less active against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> which conforms to literature data on antibacterial activity of 2,5-dimethoxy-
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene-rich essential oils [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-01883" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-26-01883" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. That activity is usually less pronounced against Gram-negative bacteria. The direct comparison of MICs determined for 
 <italic>C. cermuum</italic> REO and APEO with the results obtained by the other research teams is difficult due to differences in the laboratory standards applied.
