<p>The study on composition of essential oils obtained from roots and aerial parts of 
 <italic>C. divaricatum</italic> cultivated in Poland [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-01883" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] revealed marked differences in number and chemical structure of the compounds making up the two kinds of oil. Likewise, in 
 <italic>C. cernuum</italic>, the main constituent of the essential oil from the aerial parts of 
 <italic>C. divaricatum</italic> was 
 <italic>Î±</italic>-pinene (40%, 
 <bold>3</bold>). Thymol and its nine derivatives, including thymohydroqinone dimethyl ether (
 <bold>80</bold>, 2%), constituted nearly 5% of the oil. The content of thymol derivatives in the essential oil obtained from aerial parts of 
 <italic>C. cernuum</italic> (APEO) was much higher (20%) than that found in 
 <italic>C. divaricatum</italic>. Thymohydroquinone dimethyl ether was the most abundant thymol derivative present in the oil from aerial parts of the plant. Similar to 
 <italic>C. divaricatum</italic>, roots of 
 <italic>C. cernuum</italic> were a much better source of the essential oil than aerial parts. Likewise, the essential oils from the aerial parts, also the root essential oils of 
 <italic>C. cernuum</italic> and root oil from 
 <italic>C. divaricatum,</italic> differed in respect of the thymol derivatives content. Essential oil from roots of 
 <italic>C. cernuum</italic> (REO) contained about 88% of the compounds with thymohydroquinone dimethyl ether as a main constituent (
 <bold>80</bold>, 55% of the oil), whereas thymol derivatives constituted about 61% of 
 <italic>C. divaricatum</italic> root essential oil with 10-isobutyryloxy-8,9-epoxythymyl isobutyrate as a major component (
 <bold>127</bold>, 29%). 
 <italic>Telekia speciosa</italic> (Schreb.) Baumg., the closest relative of 
 <italic>Carpesium</italic> spp., produced essential oils rich in (
 <italic>E,E</italic>)-farnesol and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-nerolidol (leaves) or in isoalantolactone (flowers, roots). However, 10-isobutyryloxy-8,9-epoxythymyl isobutyrate (
 <bold>127</bold>) constituted 20% of the essential oil distilled from the flowers of the plant [
