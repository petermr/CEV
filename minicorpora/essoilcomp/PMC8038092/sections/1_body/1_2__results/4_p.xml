<p>To determine whether the examined essential oils are toxic to human skin, normal skin fibroblasts and keratinocytes were treated with increasing doses (12.5–400 nL/mL) of the 
 <italic>C. cernuum</italic> essential oils for 48 h. In parallel, the experiments with human melanoma cells lines A375 and C32 were performed, to assess potential anti-cancer activity and selectivity of the cytotoxic effect. Cell viabilities were estimated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay [

 <sub>50</sub>) values of the essential oils and thymol towards the individual cell lines were calculated (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-01883-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Our results indicated that toxicities of both root and aerial parts’ essential oils were almost equal. Moreover, toxic effects of the essential oils were slightly less pronounced than toxicity of thymol used as a reference agent. However, for both essential oils and thymol, no significant difference was found between toxic effect against normal and cancer cells.
