<p>Antibacterial activities of the essential oils from aerial parts and from roots of 
 <italic>C. cernuum</italic> were tested against the standard bacterial lines, both Gram-positive (
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>) and Gram-negative (
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic>, 
 <italic>Acinetobacter baumanii</italic>). Thymol, a monoterpenoid being found in numerous essential oils and having well-documented antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-26-01883" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], was used as a reference compound. In general, the essential oil distilled from the aerial parts of 
 <italic>C. cernuum</italic> demonstrated better bacteriostatic activity than that obtained from roots (see 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-01883-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). 
 <italic>A. baumanii</italic> ATCC 19606 and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 29213 were the most susceptible to both the examined essential oils and the thymol solution. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> were determined as 15.6 and 62.5 µL/mL for essential oils from 
 <italic>C. cernuum</italic> aerial parts and roots, respectively. Growth of 
 <italic>S. marcescens</italic> ATCC 13880 was inhibited only by the highest concentrations of the essential oils tested (MIC ≥ 250 µL/mL).
