<p>Volatiles from the essential oils were identified based on their MS spectra and their comparison with those from mass spectra libraries: NIST 2012, Wiley Registry of Mass Spectral Data 8th edition and MassFinder 4.1, along with the relative retention indices (RI) on DB-1 column (available from MassFinder 4.1) and on HP-5 column (available from NIST 2012). Isolated compounds were also identified by the comparison of their 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR and 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectral data with those of the compounds isolated previously in our laboratory or those from the literature.
