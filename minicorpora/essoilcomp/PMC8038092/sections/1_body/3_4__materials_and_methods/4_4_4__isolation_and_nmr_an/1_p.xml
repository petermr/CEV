<p>The relatively high yield of the essential oil (0.17%) obtained from 1.8 kg of the dried roots allowed us to isolate its components that were difficult to identify by the GC-MS method. To isolate the volatiles of interest, the essential oil was flash-chromatographed (FC) on a glass column (500 × 30 mm) filled with silica gel 60 (0.040–0.063 mm, Merck, EM Science, NJ USA), starting the elution with 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane and gradually increasing the polarity by addition of diethyl ether. The elution was accelerated by means of pressurized nitrogen (flow rate 100 mL/min). The separation was monitored by TLC and GC-MS analysis. Twenty-two fractions (1–22) of the essential oil distilled from the roots of 
 <italic>C. cernuum</italic> were obtained and analyzed by GC-MS-FID. Structures of 5 volatiles from the following fractions were confirmed using NMR spectroscopy (
 <sup>1</sup>H and/or 
 <sup>13</sup>C): fraction 6 (296 mg) thymohydroquinone dimethyl ether (93.3%), fraction 9 (170 mg) 6-methoxythymyl isobutyrate (93.8%), fraction 11 (93 mg) 6-methoxy-8,9-didehydrothymyl isobutyrate (64.2%), fraction 14 (388 mg) 7-isobutyryloxythymyl isobutyrate (85.7%) and fraction 18 (67 mg) 10-isobutyryloxy-8,9-epoxythymyl isobutyrate (69.7%).
