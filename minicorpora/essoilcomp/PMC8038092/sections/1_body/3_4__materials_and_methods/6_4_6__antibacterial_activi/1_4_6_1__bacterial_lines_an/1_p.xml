 <italic>Acinetobacter baumanii</italic> ATCC 19606 standard bacterial lines, from the collection of the Chair of Microbiology, Immunology and Laboratory Medicine, Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin, were used to assess antimicrobial activities of the essential oils distilled from roots and aerial parts of 
 <italic>C. cernuum</italic>. Prior to each experiment, the bacteria were seeded on Columbia agar medium with 5% sheep blood (bioMérieux, Warsaw, Poland) and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in aerobic conditions. After that, the single bacterial colonies were transferred into the Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and incubated for another 18 h at 37 °C in aerobic atmosphere.
