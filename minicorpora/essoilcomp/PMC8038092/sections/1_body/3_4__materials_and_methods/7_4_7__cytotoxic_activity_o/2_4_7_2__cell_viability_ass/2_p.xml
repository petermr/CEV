<p>Viability of cells was determined by the MTT assay [

 <xref rid="B46-molecules-26-01883" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Cells were plated in 96-well plates at 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per well and allowed to adhere for 24 h. Afterwards, the cells were treated with the respective concentration of essential oils or thymol and incubated for 48 h. MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) solution was added to each well and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Then, the medium was removed, and formazan crystals were dissolved in 100 μL of DMSO and 12.5 μL of Sorensen’s glycine buffer on a plate shaker. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm on a microplate reader and the results were expressed as a percentage of the absorbance measured in control cells.
