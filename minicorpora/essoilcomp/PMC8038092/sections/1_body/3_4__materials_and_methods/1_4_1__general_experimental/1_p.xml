<p>GC-MS-FID analyses of essential oils and their fractions were performed on a Trace GC Ultra Gas Chromatograph coupled with a DSQII mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron, Waltham, MA, USA). Simultaneous GC-FID and GC-MS analyses were performed using a MS-FID splitter (SGE Analytical Science, Ringwood, VIC, Australia). Mass range was 33–550 amu, ion source-heating: 200 °C, ionization energy: 70 eV. One microliter of essential oil solution (80% 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) diluted in pentane:diethyl ether was injected in split mode at split ratios (50:1). Operating conditions: capillary column Rtx-1 MS (60 m × 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 μm), and temperature program: 50 °C (3 min)–300 °C (30 min) at 4 °C/min. Injector and detector temperatures were 280 and 300 °C, respectively. Helium was a carrier gas (constant pressure: 300 kPa). The relative composition of each essential oil sample was calculated from GC peak areas according to total peak normalization. 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR (700 MHz) and 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR (175 MHz) spectra for components of essential oils were recorded with a Bruker Avance II Plus 700 MHz spectrometer (Bruker Corp., Billerica, MA, USA) in CDCl
 <sub>3</sub>, with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard.
