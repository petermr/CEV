  <italic>Hyssopus officinalis</italic> L. is a well-known aromatic plant used in traditional medicine and the food and cosmetics industry. The aim of this study is to assess the antioxidant, genotoxic, antigenotoxic and cytotoxic properties of characterized hyssop essential oils and methanol extracts. Chemical composition was analyzed by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography with diode array detection and mass spectrometry (LC-DAD-MS), respectively. Antioxidant activity was examined by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP) tests; genotoxic and antigenotoxic activity were examined by the comet assay, while cytotoxicity was evaluated by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide dye (MTT) test against tumor cell lines (SW480, MDA-MB 231, HeLa) and non-transformed human lung fibroblast cell lines (MRC-5). The essential oils were rich in monoterpene hydrocarbons (e.g., limonene; 7.99–23.81%), oxygenated monoterpenes (1,8-cineole; 38.19–67.1%) and phenylpropanoids (methyl eugenol; 0.00–28.33%). In methanol extracts, the most abundant phenolics were chlorogenic and rosmarinic acid (23.35–33.46 and 3.53–17.98 mg/g, respectively). Methanol extracts expressed moderate to weak antioxidant activity (DPPH IC
  <sub>50</sub> = 56.04–199.89 µg/mL, FRAP = 0.667–0.959 mmol Fe
  <sup>2+</sup>/g). Hyssop preparations significantly reduced DNA damage in human whole blood cells, induced by pretreatment with hydrogen peroxide. Methanol extracts exhibited selective and potent dose- and time-dependent activity against the HeLa cell line. Results of the current study demonstrated notable
