<p>Cytotoxic effects of these extracts were examined in a range of seven concentrations after 24, 48 and 72 h of treatment by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide dye (MTT) colorimetric assay. MTT assay is a method that indirectly determines cell viability. MTT is a water-soluble yellow-colored crystal that easily passes through the cell membrane because of its positive charge. In metabolically active cells, MTT is reduced to non-soluble purple formazan crystals. Mitochondrial reductase (succinate dehydrogenase), active only in viable cells, catalyzes this reaction, so the reduction of the original compound to formazan is directly proportional to the number of viable cells. The obtained results are represented as dose-response curves (
