<p>To evaluate the overall inhibitory potential of the examined extracts, we calculated IC
 <sub>50</sub> as a parameter of growth inhibition in relation to the control, which did not take into account the initial cell number at time zero. Examined extracts showed very low overall inhibitory activity against healthy cell line MRC-5, but also against the SW480 and MDA-MB 231 tumor cell lines, because their IC
 <sub>50</sub> values exceeded the highest examined concentration (data not shown). On the other hand, the HeLa cell line was susceptible to their effect with high overall inhibition indicated by low IC
 <sub>50</sub> values. Extracts 2E and 4E exhibited the strongest overall inhibitory activity after 48 h and 72 h of treatment, followed by extracts 1E, 5E and 6E, while extract 3E had the highest IC
 <sub>50</sub>. Regardless, there was no statically significant difference among the tested extracts. Importantly, the extracts displayed activity highly selective for HeLa cells with selectivity index (SI) values that ranged between 8 and 20. Antitumor activity of most clinically applied agents is restricted because of their large spectrum of side effects and general toxicity, including to some normal cells. Although scientists continue to develop compounds with a targeted mechanism of action, many of those compounds still lack selectivity for tumor cells [
