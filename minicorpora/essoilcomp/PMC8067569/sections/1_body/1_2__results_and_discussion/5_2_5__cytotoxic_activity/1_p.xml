<p>A cytotoxic agent can induce cell death when it leads to cell demise or, on the other hand, it can cause reproductive cell death, inhibiting cell growth and proliferation, while the cell remains alive. This study aimed to determine the overall cytotoxic potential, cytostatic and cytocidal effects of extracts (1Eâ€“6E) against human tumor cell lines (SW480, MDA-MB 231 and HeLa). Additionally, these effects were examined on non-transformed human lung fibroblast cell line (MRC-5).</p>
