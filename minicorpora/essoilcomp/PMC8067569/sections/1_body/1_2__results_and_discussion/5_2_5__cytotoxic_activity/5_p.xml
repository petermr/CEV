<p>Further, according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) recommendations [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-10-00711" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], we calculated three parameters to disclose whether the examined extracts had cytostatic (GI
 <sub>50</sub>, TGI) or cytocidal (LC
 <sub>50</sub>) effects on designated cell lines (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00711-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). The calculated parameters showed low to absent cytostatic or cytocidal activity of tested extracts 1E–6E against the SW480 and MDA-MB 231 cancer cell lines and, importantly, against the non-transformed cell line MRC-5 (data not shown). Contrarily, on the HeLa cell line, all examined extracts acted as very potent inhibitors of net cell growth with very low GI
 <sub>50</sub> values, especially extracts 2E and 4E, which exhibited a net cell growth inhibition for 50% of cells at concentrations lower than the minimum concentration examined after 72 h of treatment (GI
 <sub>50</sub> &lt; 0.3 μg/mL). Extracts 1E, 5E and 6E exhibited a net cell growth inhibition of 50%, with similar potency as the previous extracts. Compared to the extract of commercial hyssop herb (1E), only extract 3E had lower cell growth inhibition activity with a high statistical significance (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). The same trend was present in the perspective of total growth inhibition and cytocidal activity. Namely, extracts 2E and 4E provoked strong cytostatic effect after 72 h of treatment with TGI values of 1.69 μg/mL and &lt;0.3 μg/mL, respectively. Also, LC
 <sub>50</sub> values of these extracts were significantly lower than for other extracts (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), indicating their potent cytocidal nature. Extracts 1E, 5E and 6E followed the same trend. The tumor grows when the total rate of division of its cells exceeds the total mortality rate. The ability to grow uncontrollably is gained through the accumulation of mutations of genes that manage cell proliferation and cell death. Therefore, the agents that can override these defects, stop uncontrolled cell division and kill cancer cells are beneficial in cancer treatment. Tested extracts 1E, 2E and 4E–6E showed, along with high selectivity, a potent ability both to inhibit cell proliferation and to induce cell death in a human cervical cancer cell line. Therefore, those extracts and their compounds should be further examined for their possible application in the therapy of this type of cancer.
