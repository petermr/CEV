<p>The dominant compounds in the extracts are, as mentioned above, chlorogenic and rosmarinic acids, whose cytotoxic potential has been reported earlier [

 <xref rid="B43-plants-10-00711" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The extract 4E had the highest content of chlorogenic and rosmarinic acids, as well as total phenolic compounds, while the extract 3E, which exhibited the weakest cytotoxic activity compared to other tested extracts, had the lowest contents of total phenols and rosmarinic acid. On the other hand, the extract 2E, which also gave very good results in this study, together with the extract 4E, was distinguished neither by the content of total phenols nor by chlorogenic or rosmarinic acids. The extracts 2E and 4E also showed antigenotoxic activity in the comet assay (post-treatment protocol). Therefore, we can conclude that chlorogenic and rosmarinic acid probably contributed to the overall cytotoxic potential of the methanol extract of hyssop herb. The contribution of individual components of the extract and/or their synergistic/additive action to selective cytotoxicity against HeLa cells is of particular interest and should be further investigated in the future.
