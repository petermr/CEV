<p>The data revealed that extracts 1Eâ€“6E displayed a statistically significant percentage of growth inhibition in a dose-dependent manner on all designated cell lines after 48 h and 72 h (

 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Time-dependent growth inhibition was present only on the HeLa cell line with high statistical significance (
