<p>The results are in good agreement with the literature data. Previous studies of ethanol and deodorized aqueous extracts of the aerial parts of wild-growing 
 <italic>H</italic>. 
 <italic>officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>aristatus</italic> (originating from central Italy and eastern Serbia) showed the presence of chlorogenic acid, rosmarinic acid, 4-

 <italic>O</italic>-rutinoside), were also previously detected in extracts of hyssop herb [

 <xref rid="B24-plants-10-00711" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In a study conducted by Borrelli et al. (2019), ethanol macerate of the hyssop aerial parts was chemically analyzed and the occurrence of caffeoyl pentoside, a hydroxycinnamate derivative, was confirmed [

 <xref rid="B26-plants-10-00711" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The findings of other authors regarding the quantitative composition of different extracts of hyssop herb are consistent with the presented results. Namely, Venditti et al. (2015), as well as Hatipoğlu et al. (2013), demonstrated that the content of chlorogenic acid is the highest among the quantities of phenolics [

 <xref rid="B27-plants-10-00711" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Detailed analysis indicated that the contents of chlorogenic acid in the examined samples were 4–5 times higher than the corresponding values formerly reported, whereas the rosmarinic acid contents were closer to the literature values. However, certain variations can be expected and explained by a number of factors, e.g., differences in the extraction solvent used, the extraction methodology, the origin of the plant material and/or the developmental stage of the plant during collection.
