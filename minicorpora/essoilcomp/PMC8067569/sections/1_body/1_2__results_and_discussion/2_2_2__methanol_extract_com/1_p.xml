 <xref rid="plants-10-00711-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. LC-DAD-MS analysis of methanol extracts of hyssop flowering aerial parts revealed the presence of phenolic compounds, specifically benzoic acid derivative (syringic acid), hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives (chlorogenic, feruloylquinic and rosmarinic acids, as well as caffeoyl pentoside) and flavonoids (derivatives of quercetin and diosmetin). The identified compounds, their spectral characteristics and their retention times are given in
