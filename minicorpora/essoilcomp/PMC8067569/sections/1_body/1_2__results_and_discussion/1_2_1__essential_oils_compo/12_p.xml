<p>Our results revealed three chromatographic profiles in investigated essential oils of wild-growing plants from Montenegro. The essential oil obtained from plants collected from the locality Cuce in Montenegro (sample 6EO) was similar with the essential oil of the commercial sample from southeastern Serbia (sample 1EO), being high in 1,8-cineole and relatively rich in 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene, but low in 
 <italic>cis</italic>-pinocamphone. On the other hand, the essential oils of plants collected from the localities Šavnik and Piva in Montenegro (samples 3EO and 4EO, respectively) stood out for being high in 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene, limonene, 
 <italic>cis</italic>-pinocamphone and methyl eugenol, but relatively low in 1,8-cineol at the same time. Finally, the essential oils obtained from the plants collected from the localities Kuči and Piperi in Montenegro (samples 2EO and 5EO, respectively) appeared to be relatively rich in 1,8-cineole, limonene, 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene and 
 <italic>cis</italic>-pinocamphone.
