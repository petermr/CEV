<p>The dominant group of identified volatiles was monoterpenes (70.88–95.91%). Their oxygenated derivatives were the most abundant (41.7–68.8%), among which 1,8-cineole and 
 <italic>cis</italic>-pinocamphone were found in the highest contents. Only in the sample 4EO, the content of monoterpene hydrocarbons (43.53%) was higher than the content of oxygenated monoterpene derivatives. With regard to the monoterpene hydrocarbons, the dominant constituents were 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene and limonene. Methyl eugenol (up to 28.33%), the only compound belonging to the phenylpropanoid group, and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (up to 0.87%) were present in a lower percentage. Monoterpene hydrocarbons, such as 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene, limonene, 
 <italic>Z</italic>-
 <italic>β</italic>-ocimene, 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene, sabinene and the oxygenated monoterpene derivative myrtenal, were present in all the investigated samples.
