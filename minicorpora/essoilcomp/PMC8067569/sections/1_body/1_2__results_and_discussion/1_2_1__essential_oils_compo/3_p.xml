<p>The principal component analysis (PCA) confirmed the existence of significant chemical variation in the investigated essential oils. Performed on the entire dataset, PCA detected five principal components (PCs), with the first three accounting together for more than 86% of total variance (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-10-00711">Table S1 (Supplementary Material)</xref>, along with their loadings and scores. Along the first PC axis, the highest number of significant characters of separation (factor loadings higher than Â±0.7) was detected. The second and third PCs further underscored the chemical variations between samples.
