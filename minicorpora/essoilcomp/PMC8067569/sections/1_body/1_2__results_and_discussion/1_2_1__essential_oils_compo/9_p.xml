<p>Hajdari A. et al. (2018) investigated the composition of the essential oil of wild-growing 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>aristatus</italic> (aerial parts) from five different localities in Kosovo, and found that in four out of five samples, the dominant compound was 
 <italic>cis</italic>-pinocamphone, with the content ranging between 30.44% and 57.73%. In a sample from one of the localities, the dominant compound was 1,8-cineole (45.27%). The same authors found that the content of 
 <italic>trans</italic>-pinocamphone (14.76%) was significant in one of the samples, as well as that of 
 <italic>Î²</italic>-pinene (23.31%) and caryophyllene oxide (12.66%) [
