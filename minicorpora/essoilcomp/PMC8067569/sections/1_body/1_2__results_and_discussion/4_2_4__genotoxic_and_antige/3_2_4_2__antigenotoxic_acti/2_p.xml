<p>A decrease in the mean number of cells with DNA damage was the most pronounced for extracts 2E and 4E; however, there were no major differences in the antigenotoxic activity among the tested extracts. Similarly, Borrelli et al. (2019) indicated that the ethanol extracts of aerial parts of wild-growing 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>aristatus</italic>, native to southern Italy, did not display genotoxicity, but counteracted DNA damage in Caco-2 cells caused by hydrogen peroxide [

The notable antigenotoxic activity of the tested extracts can be attributed at least in part to the significant content of polyphenols and their ability to neutralize free radicals. Chlorogenic and rosmarinic acids, as dominant compounds in the examined preparations, could be important for the observed activity, considering that earlier published data have shown that these compounds are effective in the Comet test [
