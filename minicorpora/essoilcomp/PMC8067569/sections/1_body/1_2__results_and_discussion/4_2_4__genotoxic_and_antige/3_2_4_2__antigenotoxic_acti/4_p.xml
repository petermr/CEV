<p>The dominant compound in the 4EO was phenylpropanoid methyl eugenol. With regard to the 1EO, 2EO, 5EO and 6EO samples, the dominant constituent was an oxygenated monoterpene 1,8-cineole, whereas 
 <italic>cis</italic>-pinocamphone was present in the highest amount among components of 3EO. For methyl eugenol [

 <xref rid="B38-plants-10-00711" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], there are literature data that confirm their ability to neutralize free radicals, which could contribute to the antigenotoxic effect. The beneficial action of essential oils could be based on their participation in the direct neutralization of free radicals, but also their contribution to DNA molecule repair.
