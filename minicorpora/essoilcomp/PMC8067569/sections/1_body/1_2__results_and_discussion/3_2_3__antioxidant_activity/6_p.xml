With regard to the total antioxidant activity, Stanković et al. (2016) examined methanol extract of vegetative parts of

 <sup>2+</sup>/g to 0.959 mmol Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>/g. The chemical composition may help explain the documented antioxidant activity. Namely, earlier published papers provide evidence that the dominant compounds of the tested extracts (chlorogenic and rosmarinic acids) exhibit significant efficacy in neutralizing DPPH radicals and reducing the ferrous ion complex [
