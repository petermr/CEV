<p>These results correlate well with the values of total antioxidant activity estimated by the FRAP assay. Namely, the highest FRAP value was obtained for the 4E extract (0.959 mmol Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>/g), followed by the 5E extract (0.877 mmol Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>/g), whereas the lowest value was demonstrated for the 3E extract (0.667 mmol Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>/g).
