<p>This study evaluated the antioxidant activity and genotoxicity/antigenotoxicity, as well as cytotoxic, cytostatic and cytocidal effects against human tumor and non-transformed human lung fibroblast cell lines of the investigated 
 <italic>Hyssopus officinalis</italic> essential oils and/or extracts, with respect to their chemical composition. Our results revealed high variability in the composition of essential oils, as three chromatographic profiles of the investigated essential oils of wild-growing plants from Montenegro could be distinguished: oils rich in 1,8-cineole and relatively rich in 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene, but low in 
 <italic>cis</italic>-pinocamphone; oils rich in 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene, limonene, 
 <italic>cis</italic>-pinocamphone and methyl eugenol, but relatively low in 1,8-cineol; and oils relatively rich in 1,8-cineole, limonene, 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene and 
 <italic>cis</italic>-pinocamphone. The essential oil from the commercial plant material from Serbia, being rich in 1,8-cineole and 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene, but low in 
 <italic>cis</italic>-pinocamphone, appeared similar to only one of the samples obtained from wild-growing plants from Montenegro. Both the extracts and the essential oils significantly reduced in vitro DNA damage. In addition, potent and selective cytotoxic action of the hyssop methanol extracts on the HeLa cell line was observed. These findings deserve closer attention and our further investigations, which will be performed in the prospective future, and should be directed to the panel of cancer cell lines derived from the most sensitive tissue (cervix), along with a detailed mechanism of antitumor effect and the isolation/chemical characterization of the constituents that are presumably responsible for observed activity.
