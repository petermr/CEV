<p>Consequently, the main objectives of the present work were to quantify the levels of in vitro antioxidant activity by commonly used 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP) tests, to assess potential genotoxicity/antigenotoxicity by comet assay, and to determine the overall cytotoxic, cytostatic and cytocidal effects against human tumor and non-transformed human lung fibroblast cell lines of investigated hyssop essential oils and/or extracts, with respect to their chemical composition.</p>
