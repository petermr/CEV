 <italic>Hyssopi herba,</italic> as an herbal medicinal substance and a raw material for pharmaceutical and related industries, is neither official in pharmacopoeias, nor listed in the other well-established documents. Therefore, the question of its pharmaceutical quality still remains open. Having in mind that growing (for plants harvested from the wild) and/or cultivation conditions can significantly affect the composition and activity of a given plant, it would explain the need for sampling at different sites, as well as the use of a commercial sample-that is something that a person can find, if needed.
