<p>The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% aqueous formic acid (phase A) and acetonitrile (phase B). The following gradient elution program was used: 10% B to 35% B (0–20 min), 35% B to 90% B (20–24 min), 90% B (24–25 min) and 90% B to 10% B (25–30 min), at a total operating time interval of 30 min, a mobile phase flow rate of 0.35 mL/min and an injection volume of 3.00 µL. UV spectral data of all peaks were collected in the range 190 to 640 nm, and chromatograms were recorded at 210, 270, 320 and 350 nm. API-ESI in the negative polarity and the range 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 100–1000 was used for analyte ionization. The parameters of the ion source were as follows: fragmentation voltages 100 and 250 V, drying gas flow (nitrogen) 10.0 L/min, drying gas temperature 350 °C, nebulization pressure 40 psi and capillary voltage 3500 V.
