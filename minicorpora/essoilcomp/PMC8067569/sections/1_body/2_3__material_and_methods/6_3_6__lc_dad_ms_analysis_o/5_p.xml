<p>Stock solutions of chlorogenic acid (0.4 mg/mL) and rosmarinic acid (0.5 mg/mL) were prepared by dissolving the reference substances in methanol and their subsequent filtration through a syringe filter (0.45 ÂµM, Captiva, Agilent). By further dilution with the same solvent, calibration standards with a wide range of concentrations were prepared. This procedure (including the preparation of stock solutions) was repeated three times so that three measurements were made for each calibration point. Calibration curves and coefficients of determination were obtained by linear regression analysis. Limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantification (LoQ) were calculated according to the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines [
