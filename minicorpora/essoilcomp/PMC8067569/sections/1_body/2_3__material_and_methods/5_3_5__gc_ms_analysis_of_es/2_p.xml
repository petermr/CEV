<p>A 0.2 µL aliquot of each essential oil solution (10 µL/mL in hexane) was injected in split mode, with a split ratio of 1:20, at the temperature 220 °C. The components were separated on a nonpolar poly (tetramethyl-1,4-sulfenylenesiloxane) HP-5ms column (Agilent Technologies; 30 m × 0.25 mm, layer thickness 0.25 µm). The column was eluted in the temperature-programmed mode: initial temperature 60 °C, increase 3 °C/min to 246 °C (total analysis time 62 min). High-purity helium (5.0) was used as the carrier gas with a constant flow of 0.9 mL/min. The effluent was transferred to the Agilent Technologies 5975 series electron ionization mass spectrometer via a transfer line maintained at 280 °C. The parameters of the mass spectrometer were as follows: electron energy 70 eV, ion source temperature 230 °C, quadrupole temperature 150 °C. Acquisition scan mode was applied in the range 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 35–400 with a solvent delay of 2.30 min. To achieve a better agreement between the experimental and library spectra, the standard spectra tune was used.
