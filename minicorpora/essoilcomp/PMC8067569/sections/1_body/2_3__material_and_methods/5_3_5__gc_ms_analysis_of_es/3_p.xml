<p>Acquired data were processed using Agilent Technologies MSD ChemStation software (revision E01.01.335) in combination with NIST MS Search software (ver. 2.0d). The spectral libraries Wiley Registry of Mass Spectral Data [

 <xref rid="B47-plants-10-00711" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and Adamsâ€™ mass spectral library of essential oils (3rd Edition) [
 <xref rid="B48-plants-10-00711" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] were used to identify mass spectra. The identity of the compounds was demonstrated by comparing the MS spectra and linear retention indices with the literature data. The relative proportion of compounds was determined using the area standardization method and expressed as area %.
