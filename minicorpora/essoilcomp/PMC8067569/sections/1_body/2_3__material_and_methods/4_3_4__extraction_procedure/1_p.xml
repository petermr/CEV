<p>Methanol extracts were prepared by bimaceration, according to the 
 <italic>Pharmacopoea Jugoslavica IV</italic> (1984) [
 <xref rid="B45-plants-10-00711" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Obtained methanol extracts were brought to dryness using a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure and a temperature below 50 °C, and subsequently, by a stream of nitrogen. Prior to analysis, the extracts were stored at 4 °C in tightly closed glass jars. The extracts were reconstituted just before the analysis by the addition of methanol up to the concentration of 5 mg/mL and filtered through a 0.45 μm membrane filter (Captive Syringe Filters, Agilent, Germany).
