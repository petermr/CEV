<p>For the genotoxic and antigenotoxic activity assays, the results are expressed as the mean value (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3) ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical analysis of the comet assay results was performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s post hoc test for comparisons of different treatments vs. the respective controls. GraphPad Prism 6.0 software was used. A regression was used to determine the effect of the bioactive substance concentration on the outcome. The values of the obtained data were considered statistically significant if 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, and statistically highly significant if 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001.
