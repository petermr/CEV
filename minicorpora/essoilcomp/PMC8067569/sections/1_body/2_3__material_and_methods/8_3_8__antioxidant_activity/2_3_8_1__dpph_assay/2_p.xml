<p>The methanol solutions of the tested hyssop extracts were prepared in different concentrations, along with the standard methanol solutions of rutin. The test solution consisted of a mixture of 0.1 mL of the methanol solution of tested extract, 0.1 mL of methanol and 0.05 mL of 0.5 mM methanol solution of DPPH. The mixtures were shaken vigorously and incubated for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. The absorbances were measured at 492 nm against methanol as a blank test on Biochrom EZ Read 400 microtiter plate reader. The negative control consisted of 0.2 mL of methanol and 0.05 mL of 0.5 mmol/L DPPH solution. DPPH inhibition was calculated according to the following formula:
 <disp-formula>I (%) = (Ac − At)/Ac × 100
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where Ac is the absorbance of the control and At is the absorbance of test solutions.
