<p>In these formulas, T
 <sub>0</sub> is the absorbance at time zero (when the compound is added), Tis the absorbance of the test well after 24, 48 or 72 h of exposure to the test compound and C is the optical density of the control wells (cells incubated for 48 h with no additives). If the effect was not reached or was exceeded, the value for that parameter was expressed as greater or less than the maximum or minimum concentration tested.
