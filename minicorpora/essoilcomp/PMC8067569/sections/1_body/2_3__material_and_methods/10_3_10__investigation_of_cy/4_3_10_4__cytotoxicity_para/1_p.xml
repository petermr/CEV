<p>The results of the MTT assay are presented as the percentage of the values for control cells that was arbitrarily set to 100%. Cell growth inhibition was calculated according to the expression:
 <disp-formula>(A
  <sub>0</sub> − A) × 100/A
  <sub>0</sub>
  <label>(2)</label>
 </disp-formula> where A
 <sub>0</sub> is absorbance from control wells and A is absorbance from wells exposed to the tested extracts.
