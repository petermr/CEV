<p>The selectivity index (SI) was calculated as the quotient of IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for the treated non-transformed cell line and the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for the tested extracts on malignant cells. SI &lt; 2 indicates general toxicity of a compound, SI ≥ 2 indicates selective toxicity and SI ≥ 3 indicates highly selective toxicity [
