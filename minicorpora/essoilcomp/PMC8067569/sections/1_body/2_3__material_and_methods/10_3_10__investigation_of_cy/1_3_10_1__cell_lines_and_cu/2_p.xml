<p>Cells were cultured in DMEM at pH = 7.4, enriched with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, L-glutamine, non-essential amino acids (0.1 mM), penicillin (100 IU/mL) and streptomycin (100 μg/mL). Cultivation was performed in T-25 flasks (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in an aseptic environment under standard culture conditions (37 °C, absolute humidified air and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>). The media were changed when necessary and cells were subcultured every fifth day. Just before in vitro experiments, subconfluent cell monolayers (~80%) in the logarithmic growth phase were detached from the bottom of the flask by short-term treatment with 0.25% trypsin and 0.53 mM EDTA combination dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline.
