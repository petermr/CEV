<p>The cells were seeded in 96-well flat-bottom microtiter plates (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at a density of 5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells per well and incubated overnight to adhere. After 24 h, the supernatant was replaced with extract solutions at seven different concentrations (0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100 and 300 μg/mL). In the control wells, cells grew in the presence of supplemented nutrient media only. The cells were incubated for 24, 48 and 72 h. The MTT solution, at a final concentration 0.5 mg/mL in the unsupplemented medium, was added to each well at time zero (after overnight incubation) and the end of different incubation periods. Following 2 h of incubation, the MTT solution was discarded and formazan crystals were solubilized with 150 μL of DMSO. The plates were shaken for 5 min and the absorbance was measured at 550 nm with a multiplate reader (Zenyth 3100, Anthos Labtec Instruments GmbH, Wals-Salzburg, Austria).
