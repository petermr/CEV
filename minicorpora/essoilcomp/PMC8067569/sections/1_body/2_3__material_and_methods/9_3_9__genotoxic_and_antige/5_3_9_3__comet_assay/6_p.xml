<p>The analysis was performed by determining the length and density of DNA in the “tail” based on which of the nucleoids (comets) were classified into five groups, as described by Anderson et al. (1994) [

The degree of total DNA damage was expressed as the sum of all DNA damage/migrations over 5% (B + C + D + E).
