<p>To determine the degree of DNA damage for each donor and each concentration, 200 nucleoids (comets) were selected and analyzed by random selection, or 100 from each duplicate microscope plate, using an Olympus BX 50 fluorescent microscope (Olympus Optical Co., GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) with a mercury short arc lamp (HBO) (50 W, 516–560 nm Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Jena, Germany) at 100 × magnification.</p>
