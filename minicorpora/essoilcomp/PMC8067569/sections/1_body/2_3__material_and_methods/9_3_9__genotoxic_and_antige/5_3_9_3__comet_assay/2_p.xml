<p>A quantity of 100 μL of the test suspension, containing 6 μL of peripheral blood suspended in 0.67% of LMPA, was evenly applied to the prepared microscopic plates coated with a layer of 1% NMPA. Cover glasses were placed on the plates and then left at 4 °C for 5 min. The cover glasses were slowly removed and the cells were exposed to the appropriate treatment (as previously described for genotoxic or antigenotoxic activities). After treatment, the third layer of 100 μL of 0.5% LMPA was applied, cover glasses were placed and the plates were again left at 4 °C for 5 min. The cover glasses were again carefully removed, the microscope plates were immersed in lysis solution (2.5 M NaCl, 100 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris, 1% Triton X100 and 10% DMSO; pH 10 adjusted with NaOH) and kept at 4 °C overnight. After cell lysis, DNA denaturation was performed in the same solution that was later used for electrophoresis for 30 min (10 M NaOH, 200 mM EDTA, pH ≥ 13).</p>
