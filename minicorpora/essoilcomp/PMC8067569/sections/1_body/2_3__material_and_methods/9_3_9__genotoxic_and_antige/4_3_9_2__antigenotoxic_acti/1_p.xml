 <sub>2</sub> for 20 min at 4 °C and washed with PBS; afterward, they were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with tested essential oils/methanol extracts. The concentration of 400 µg/mL was chosen for further testing, because it was the most effective concentration in the antigenotoxic assessment of commercial extract. The attenuation of H

 <sub>2</sub>-induced DNA damage in human peripheral blood leukocytes in the post-treatment with EO was assessed using the concentration that did not induce a statistically significant increase of DNA damage in the tested cells in the genotoxicity assessment (2.5 µg/mL).
