<p>Sesquiterpene is an important category of terpenoids, found to possess a large spectrum of biological activities. As discussed in the present review, these plant actives have been reported to play a significant role in the improvement of cholinergic transmission by inhibiting the AChE. In literature, multiple sesquiterpenes havebeen evident from the past decade to possess the AChE inhibitory activity. The percentage of compounds having anti acetylcholinesterase potential from different categories of sesquiterpenes has been indicated in
