<p>Recent clinical studies have shown that the AChE inhibitors significantly alleviate Alzheimerâ€™s symptoms and also lessen the rates of related mortality [
 <xref rid="B154-biomolecules-11-00350" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>]. However, most of the time the patients discontinue their use due to associated side effects. Hence, it is very important to assess the toxicological profile of the novel compounds. Unfortunately, most of the plant actives reported in this article were not evaluated for the unwanted side effects. Furthermore, the Galliardin, a guainolide-type sesquiterpene, possesses good AChE inhibitory potential, but it also has significant cytotoxic properties [

Therefore, it is suggested that the derivatization of potential compounds could be carried out in the future to obtain clinically effective AChE inhibitors with less or no cytotoxicity. Moreover, the promising sesquiterpenes should also be assessed for clinical data to obtainreliable and safe anti-Alzheimer candidates.
