<p>Furthermore, the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease includes the degeneration of neurons at vulnerable spots in the brain such as thehippocampus and cortex region [

 <xref rid="B152-biomolecules-11-00350" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. Hence, to be a potential candidate for Alzheimer’s therapy, a compound must pass the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and should be sufficiently bioavailable in the affected area of the brain. The lipophilic nature and low polarity of sesquiterpenes render them bioavailable at specific sites [

 <xref rid="B153-biomolecules-11-00350" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. Moreover, the various tools (such as Molinspiration, Swiss ADME) from the molecular modeling docking portal can be employed to predict the probability of a novel compound for crossing the BBB. The ability of the ambrosin, a sesquiterpene, was successfully predicted by using this technique [
