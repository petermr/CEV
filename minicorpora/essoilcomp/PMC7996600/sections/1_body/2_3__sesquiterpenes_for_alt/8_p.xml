<p>The Jatanolides, Jatamansone, and Jatamansic acid are the main sesquiterpene alkaloids isolated from the

 <xref rid="B146-biomolecules-11-00350" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>] studied the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Nardostachys jatmansi</italic> in mice to evaluate its memory enhancing property and found it capable of significantly improving the learning and memory at a dose of 200 mg/kg and also reversed the scopolamine (0.4 mg/kg, i.p.) and diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.) induced amnesia. It was concluded that memory enhancement could be a result of the facilitation of cholinergic transmission in the brain becausethe extract showed potential against scopolamine-induced impairment. Furthermore, the extract also reversed the aging-related amnesia proving it as a beneficial memory restorative constituent in elderly individuals with dementia. The mechanism of action can be credited to its anti-oxidative property. The neuroprotective, anti-cerebral ischemic and antioxidative properties of various Jatanolides present in the plant may be the reason for its memory-enhancing activity.
