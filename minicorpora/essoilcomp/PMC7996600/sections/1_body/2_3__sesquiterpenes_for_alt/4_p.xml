<p>Amoahet al. [
 <xref rid="B140-biomolecules-11-00350" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>] studied the SLs and sesquiterpene alcohol (SA) isolated from the 
 <italic>Hedyosmum brasiliense</italic> (Family–Chloranthaceae) for anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activities. During the investigation, it was observed that aromadendrane-4β,10α-diol (ARD), 13-hydroxy-8,9-dehydroshizukanolide (HDS) and podoandin (PDA), efficiently ameliorated the Aβ peptide-induced memory impairment in models of the passive avoidance task (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The above-stated SLs compounds showed a considerable effect on oxidative stress and enhanced the memory power in animals that received Aβ-42 infusion. However, the neuroprotective effects possessed by these tested compounds were found more correlated to the existence of the guaiane ring in comparison to the presence of the lactone ring for which mechanism of action is described by Michael-type nucleophilic addition. This study confirmed that ARD, HDS, and PDA, the constituents of 
 <italic>H. brasiliense,</italic> are efficient in inhibiting the cognitive deficits of animals and may be used in treating AD.
