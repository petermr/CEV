<p>Qi et al. [
 <xref rid="B138-biomolecules-11-00350" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>] investigated the waste produced of 
 <italic>Stigma maydis</italic> (maize) industry and isolated macrocarpene type sesquiterpenes compounds, namely Stigmene A and Stigmene B, and screened for their Aβ aggregation inhibitory activities. It was observed that (%) decrease in Aβ aggregation was found more in the case of Stigmene A (82.9 ± 2.52%) and Stigmene B (70.1 ± 3.01%) when compared against a positive control, (69.8 ± 1.55%). The result of the study suggested that the presence of these two valuable compounds made 
 <italic>Stigma maydis</italic> crop waste a promising source for the pharmaceutical firms involved in the manufacturing/research of formulations for neurological disorders such as AD.
