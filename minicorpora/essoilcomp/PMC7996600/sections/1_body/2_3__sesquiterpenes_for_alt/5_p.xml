<p>Neuroinflammation is one of the major factors of AD and other disorders related to cholinergic transmission. It can be attenuated by reducing the expression of NF-κB-p65 via NLRP3 pathways. Thus targeting the transcription factor (NF-κβp65) could be the novel approach for the treatment of AD. This factor upregulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines and genes related to oxidative stress and BACE-1 (B-site APP Cleaving Enzyme), responsible for the production of β-amyloid [

 <italic>Alpiniae oxyphyllae</italic> Fructus and demonstrated that it could improve the lipopolysaccharide-induced memory and learning impairment, which was proposed to be associated with its attenuating neuroinflammatory activity through the expression of transcription factor NF-κB-p65. Nootkatone at 10 mg/kg showed significant improvement in neuroprotective potential on evaluation through various behavioral models (Morris water maze and Y maze). This study indicated that the compound, nootkatone, might play a role as a potent therapeutic agent in treating AD and neuroinflammation via improvement in cholinergic transmission, clearing amyloid-β-peptide, and reducing oxidative stress.
