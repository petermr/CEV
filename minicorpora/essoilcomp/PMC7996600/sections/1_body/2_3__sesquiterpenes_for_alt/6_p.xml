<p>In addition, ambrosin, another sesquiterpene lactone, was isolated from the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Ambrosia maritima</italic> (Family-Asteraceae). Although it was not evaluated for the AChE inhibitory potential but found to reduce the expression of NF-κβp65, transcription factor, in experimental mice. Halting the expression of this factor could reduce the production of β-amyloid (Aβ), which results in enhancement of cholinergic transmission at the synapse. Moreover, ambrosin at 10 mg/kg dose also reduces the detrimental effect of lipopolysaccharide on the learning and memory potential of mice [
