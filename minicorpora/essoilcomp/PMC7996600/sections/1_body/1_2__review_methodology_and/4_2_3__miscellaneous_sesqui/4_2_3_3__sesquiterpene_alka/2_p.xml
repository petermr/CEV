<p>Gul et al. [
 <xref rid="B133-biomolecules-11-00350" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>] extracted a broad neuroprotective sesquiterpene alkaloid, Huperzine-A (
 <bold>58</bold>) from the Chinese herb, 
 <italic>Huperia serrata</italic>. This natural compound showed reversible AChE inhibitory activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 22 μM) and can enhance cognitive abilities and task switching functions rapidly in people suffering from AD. One more study suggested that this compound may be beneficial in treating hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in neonates. Huperzine-A has been proved to lessen the glutamate-induced cytotoxicity by its antagonizing action on cerebral N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, and this mechanism of antagonism is one plausible justification for its neuroprotection property [

 <xref rid="B3-biomolecules-11-00350" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] investigation about the compound provided a marked base for the establishment of this compound as a reversible, selective, potent, and finely tolerated inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase which can considerably improve the memory and learning deficit in the persons suffering from Alzheimer’s disease.
