<p>Sesquiterpene coumarins (SC) is an interesting family of natural products, isolated mainly from 
 <italic>Ferula</italic> genus in which through an ether linkage coumarin moiety mainly umbelliferone (7-hydroxycoumarin) and sometimes isofraxidin (7-hydroxy-6,8-dimethoxycoumarin) or scopoletin (7-hydroxy-6-methoxycoumarin) is connected to the C
 <sub>15</sub> terpene moiety. The prenyl-furocoumarin-type sesquiterpenoids represent a different cluster in sesquiterpene coumarins, whereby the involvement of C
 <sub>3</sub>, coumarin, and C
 <sub>15</sub> moiety are connected through the Câ€“C bond. SC is set up in numerous medicinal plants belonging to various other families such as Asteraceae, Rutaceae, Apiaceae, etc. [

 <italic>Ferula</italic> genus always has been a matter of study and controversy because of its wide chemical variation in different types of plants from different locations. For illustration purposes, investigations of 
 <italic>Ferulacommunis</italic> population from Sardinia revealed that two chemotypes of the plant from this region have different characteristics. One of the chemotypes contained prenylated 4-hydroxycoumarins, which are toxic while the second one demonstrated therapeutic activity because of the presence of the SC ethers [
