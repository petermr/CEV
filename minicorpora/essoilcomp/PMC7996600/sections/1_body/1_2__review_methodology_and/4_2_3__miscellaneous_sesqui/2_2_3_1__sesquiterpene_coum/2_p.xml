<p>Guvenalpet al. [
 <xref rid="B129-biomolecules-11-00350" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>] isolated the sesquiterpene coumarins such as umbelliprenin (
 <bold>42</bold>) and feselol (
 <bold>43</bold>) from the chloroform extract of 
 <italic>Heptapteracilicica</italic> fruits. The compounds showed potential inhibitory activity against AChE (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 6 ± 0.03 μM and 1 ± 0.01 μM, respectively) and BChE (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 10 ± 0.24μM and 1 ± 0.19 μM, respectively) and established the plant as an emerging source in AD treatment. Other studies have also been conducted in the past, supporting the anticholinesterase activity of these compounds.
