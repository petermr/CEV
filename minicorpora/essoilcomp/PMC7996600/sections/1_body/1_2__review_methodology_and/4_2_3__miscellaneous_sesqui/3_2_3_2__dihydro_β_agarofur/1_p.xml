<p>Tricyclic 5,11-epoxy-5-β,10-α-eudesman-4-(14)-ene is the basic moiety accounting for this structurally diverse class, dihydro-β-agarofuransesquiterpenes. These compounds mainly belong to the family Celastraceae and are held responsible for many pharmacological activities such as their anti-HIV, cytotoxic, insecticidal, anti-feedant, and immunosuppressive properties, etc. A lot of therapeutic significance of medicinal plants has been recognized from the family of more oxygenated sesquiterpenoids, which are depending on a tricyclic dihydroagarofuran skeleton type. Studies conducted on the agarofuran compounds with a motive of developing some new AChE inhibitors have achieved great success in the past years and suggested that agarofuran compounds may act as lead compounds in the designing of new, less toxic, and highly selective anticholinesterase agents along with some other positive therapeutic effects [
