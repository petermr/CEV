<p>Herbal compounds, owning a standing as the efficient agents in numerous biological systems, currently are drawing interest for inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity or in the prevention of AD. The secondary metabolites of the various classes such as alkaloids, terpenoids, coumarins, flavonoids, etc. have been reported to have potent AChEinhibitory activity [

The potential of various sesquiterpenes as anticholinesterase has been reviewed in this article. For this purpose, the various databases, mainly PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were investigated with different keywords such as “sesquiterpenes+acetylcholinesterase” and “sesquiterpenes+cholinesterase+inhibitors” in the surveyed time frame (2010–2020) [
