<p>Ibrahim et al. [
 <xref rid="B124-biomolecules-11-00350" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>] isolated four sesquiterpene lactones from 
 <italic>Amberboa ramosa</italic> (Family-Asteraceae) using the ethyl acetate soluble fraction and tested them against AChE and BChE. Their IC
 <sub>50</sub> (μM) for AChE inhibition was reported as 17 ± 0.01, 9 ± 0.2, 0.9 ± 0.02 and 1 ± 0.08 for sesquiterpene lactones Amberin (
 <bold>37</bold>), Amberbin-A (
 <bold>38</bold>), Amberbin-B (
 <bold>39</bold>), and Amberbin-C (
 <bold>40</bold>), respectively, and for BChE inhibition was at 3 ± 0.02 (Amberin), 5 ± 0.2 (Amberin-A), 2.5 ± 0.2 (Amberin-B) and 18 ± 0.05 (Amberin-C). This study showed that all the SLs. isolated from 
 <italic>Amberboa ramosa</italic> might be effective against AChE and BChE enzymes and could be used as remarkable lead molecules in the drug development for the prevention of AD. Patel and Amin [
 <xref rid="B125-biomolecules-11-00350" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>] extracted the 7-hydroxy frullanolide (
 <bold>41</bold>), a sesquiterpene lactone, from the flower heads of 
 <italic>Sphaeranthus indicus</italic> (Family-Asteraceae) and carried out in vitro anticholinesterase activity of several extracts. Petroleum ether fraction was found to be loaded with SLs (about 80%), accounting for its anti-AChE activity. It was observed that petroleum ether fraction was the only portion with AChE inhibitory potential with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 37 mg/mL and the extract at a dose of 10 mg/kg, per orally. in mice considerably inverted the cognitive damages caused through the passive avoidance test (
