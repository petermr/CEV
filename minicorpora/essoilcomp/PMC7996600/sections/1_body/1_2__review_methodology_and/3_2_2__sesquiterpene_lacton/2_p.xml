<p>They are frequently isolated from the plants of the Asteraceae/Compositae family and reported to possess significant therapeutic activity. Elsebaia et al. [
 <xref rid="B121-biomolecules-11-00350" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>] reported on amberboin (
 <bold>33</bold>) and lipidiol (
 <bold>34</bold>) as sesquiterpene lactones from the 
 <italic>Volutaria abyssinica</italic> A. Rich (Family-Asteraceae) for the acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity. Docking study of both compounds confirms the affinity of them towards the active sites of AChE, which indicated inhibitory activity against AChE at IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.8 ± 0.03 µM and 0.5 ± 0.01 µM, respectively. Further, amberboin also inhibited the BChE at IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.6 ± 0.13 µM. The results clearly stated that the two isolated sesquiterpene lactones are the better inhibitors of AChE and BChEas compared to the reference, galanthamine (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 3 ± 0.2 μM and 47 ± 1 μM for AChE and BChE, respectively). In addition, the leaves of 
 <italic>Cynara cornigera</italic> (Wild artichoke) from the Asteraceae family were extracted using methanol and seven SLs were isolated. Furthermore, a computational pharmacophore interpretation and docking design were accomplished to assess the pharmacophoric sorts and binding conformation of the isolated compounds in the AChE active site. Out of the seven metabolites, sibthorpine (
 <bold>35</bold>) showedAChE inhibitory activity presenting this compound to be tested for anti-neurodegenerative activity. It was observed from the study that sibthorpine isolated from 
 <italic>Cynara cornigera</italic> is responsible for the inhibition of anticholinesterase (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 71 μM) activity [
