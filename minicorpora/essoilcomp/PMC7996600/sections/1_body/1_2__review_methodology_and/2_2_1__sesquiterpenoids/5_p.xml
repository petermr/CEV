<p>Chen et al. [
 <xref rid="B88-biomolecules-11-00350" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] extracted the sesquiterpenoids from the root of 
 <italic>Valeriana officinalis</italic> var. latifolia and investigated their AChE inhibitory activities by the modified in vitro Ellman method. It was observed that the Volvalerenic acid K (
 <bold>8</bold>) improved the learning and memory abilities of mice, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.16 ÂµM in vitro. The results of the study showed that, in mice (APPswe/PS1E9 double-transgenic mouse) from middle and high dose groups, the AChT (acetylcholine transferase) activity had been improved in the brain tissues, while the AChE activity was significantly decreased causing an increase in the learning memory.
