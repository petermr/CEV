<p>Olawuni et al. [
 <xref rid="B96-biomolecules-11-00350" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>] extracted the essential oils of 
 <italic>Monodora myristica</italic> and 
 <italic>Piper nigrum</italic> Linn. seeds and evaluated them for their anti-cholinesterase and antioxidant activities. Both the oils showed significant AChE and BChE inhibitory activity (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in a dose-dependent manner at the concentration of 416 µg/mL. 
 <italic>M. myristica</italic> elicited stronger inhibition for AChE and BChE with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 205 ± 0.06 µg/mL and 178 ± 0.02 µg/mL with 79% and 89% inhibition, whereas the 
 <italic>P. nigrum</italic> oil inhibited the AChE (75%) and BChE (85%) with IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.3 ± 0.02 µg/mL and 223 ± 0.002 µg/mL, respectively. The various sesquiterpenoids such as phellandrene (18.13%), caryophyllene (4.55%), and copaene (2.23%) present in these oils and may be responsible for the acetylcholinesterase inhibitory potential and could be investigated in future individually.
