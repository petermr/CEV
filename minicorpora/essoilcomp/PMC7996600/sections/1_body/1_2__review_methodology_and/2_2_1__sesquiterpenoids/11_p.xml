<p>Furthermore, the molecular docking study could also be helpful in determining the AChE inhibitory potential of a compound or essential oil. Autodock 4.2 and iGemDock 2.1 software were employed to find out the affinity of isolated essential oil from 
 <italic>Myrciaria floribunda</italic> (H. Westex Wild) for AD target protein AChE. The oil exhibited the AChE inhibitory potential with IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.08 μg/mL, and this activity is attributed to the higher binding affinity of δ-cadinene and γ-cadinene (oil constituents) toward AChE as predicted by the docking score of –7.35 and –6.77, respectively [
