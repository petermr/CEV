<p>Choi et al. [
 <xref rid="B85-biomolecules-11-00350" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] isolated a novel seco-illudoid sesquiterpene, pterosinone(
 <bold>1</bold>) from the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Pteridium aquilinum</italic>. Pterosinone was reported to have mild inhibitory activity against acetyl and butyl cholinesterase enzymes with IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 88 μM and 73 μM, respectively. It was concluded from the results that sesquiterpenoids could be useful in treating AD. Chougouo et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-biomolecules-11-00350" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] isolated artemisinin (
 <bold>2</bold>) and chrysosplenetin (
 <bold>3</bold>) from the ethanol extract of 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> Linn. for the modulation of anticholinesterase (AChE) activity. The crude extract with artemisinin and chrysosplenetin showed the inhibition of AChE activity by 72% and 80% at 0.1 mg/mL with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 104 µM and 73 µM.This study supported the possible use of these two compounds in neurological disorders including AD.
