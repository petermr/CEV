<p>Some sesquiterpenes isolated from the plants and their worthy roles in the prevention of AD are also summarized in 
 <xref rid="biomolecules-11-00350-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The structure of major sesquiterpenoids with AChE inhibitory potential is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-11-00350-f002">Figure 2</xref>. As the AChE inhibition is one of the treatment approaches for most neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimerâ€™sdisease, the essential oils that are easily inhalable and possess the AChE inhibitory potential might present a fresh vision toward the treatment of these neuronal diseases, including AD.
