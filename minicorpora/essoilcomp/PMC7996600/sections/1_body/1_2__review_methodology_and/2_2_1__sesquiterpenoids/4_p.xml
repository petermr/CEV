<p>Yang et al. [
 <xref rid="B87-biomolecules-11-00350" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] reported the isolation of eremophilane sesquiterpenes from the 
 <italic>Aquilaria sinensis</italic> (Lour.) Glig and elucidated their structures by the spectroscopic procedures. Isolated compounds were found out to be 7-β-
 <italic>H</italic>-9-(10)-ene-11,12-epoxy-8-oxoeremophilane (
 <bold>5</bold>) (48 ± 2% inhibition at 50 mg/mL with IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 275 ± 5 µM); 7α-
 <italic>H</italic>-9(10)-ene-11,12-epoxy-8-oxoeremophilane (
 <bold>6</bold>) with 31 ± 1% inhibition at 50 mg/mL with IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 491 ± 4 µM); neopetasane (
 <bold>7</bold>) (62 ± 1% inhibition at 50 mg/mL with IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 158 ± 4 µM).
