<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most leading kind of dementia, is an age-linked neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 24 million people around the world [

 <xref rid="B2-biomolecules-11-00350" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-biomolecules-11-00350" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that there will be more than 100% growth of this number by the end of the year 2030. Moreover, as per the data available, it can be stated that AD affects almost every fifth person at the age of 80 years and up [

 <xref rid="B5-biomolecules-11-00350" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. AD is a gradually growing irreversible illness of the brain and is characterized by the loss of memory, language impairment, disorientation, abstract thinking impairment, mood swings, behavior changes, loss of initiative, and trouble in performing the regular tasks on a daily basis [

 <xref rid="B7-biomolecules-11-00350" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The formation and deposition of the β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and accumulation of intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau proteins or neurofibrillary tangles are the main hallmarks of the AD pathophysiology [

 <xref rid="B12-biomolecules-11-00350" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In addition, the inflammation of neurons, stress due to free radicals, and mitochondrial dysfunction are involved in neuron degeneration and result in poor cholinergic transmission [

 <xref rid="B15-biomolecules-11-00350" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It has also been observed that cholinergic neurons are highly damaged in the forebrain during the progression of AD [

 <xref rid="B17-biomolecules-11-00350" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. An increase of acetylcholine concentration (ACh) at the synapse by inhibiting the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is one of the approaches to slow down the progression of AD [

The enzyme mainly has two active sites, peripheral anionic site (PAS) and catalytic active site (CAS), for the binding of substrate, i.e., acetylcholine. The ACh temporarily sequesters to the PAS through π-cation interaction between tryptophan on enzyme surface and quaternary amine of ACh. Later, a tetrahedral intermediate forms at CAS (at the deeper gorge of enzyme) by a reaction between the oxygen atom of the acetyl group of ACh and serine–histidine–glutamate residue of the enzyme through a covalent bond (
