<p>In future studies, a scientific approach can be acquired from this systematized information to prepare a baseline for the further consideration of natural cognitive enhancers (especially sesquiterpenes) in age-related diseases such asAD. Moreover, the described moieties could be further investigated for better derivatives in terms of safety and efficacy. Furthermore, it is also speculated that a mere delay in the symptoms of AD by one year could reduce the patient load significantly (upto 9.2 million) in 2050. Hence, it can also be concluded that the use of suggested herbs as nutraceuticals/dietary supplements could significantly alleviate the symptoms of AD and prove highly beneficial for mankind.</p>
