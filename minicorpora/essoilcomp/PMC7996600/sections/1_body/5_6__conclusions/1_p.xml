<p>No doubt extensive researchhas been carried out to explore suitable candidates for AD management. In spite of the availability of bulk knowledge related to this progressive disorder, we have access only to symptomatic treatment, not to a complete cure. Improvement in cholinergic transmission by inhibiting the AChE was considered to delay the AD progression and relieve the AD-associated symptoms. This review mainly focuses on the various sesquiterpenes acting as potential acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and also summarizes their role on alternate AD targets. The literature revealed the potential of sesquiterpenes such as amberboin and lipidiol in the inhibition of AChE. Moreover, the sesquiterpenes such as Farnesene, Bilabolide, and Jatamansone were found to exert a significant effect on different AD targets such as Aβ plaque, neuron excitability, and oxidative stress. Nowadays, the paradigm for AD management has shifted toward the management of neuroinflammation by novel compounds. Sesquiterpenes such asambrosin and nootkatone alleviate neuroinflammation by reducing the expression of transcription factor NF-κβp65.</p>
