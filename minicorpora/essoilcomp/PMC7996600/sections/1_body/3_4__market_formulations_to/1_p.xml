<p>There are various formulations available in the market that claim to alleviate the symptoms of AD. However, in reality, only a few marketed drugs clinically improve cholinergic transmission by inhibiting the cholinesterase enzyme. Moreover, the literature review reveals that only a single cholinesterase inhibitor is in Phase II and Phase III clinical trials, for AD management [

The extracts of these herbs are reported to contain sesquiterpenes such asBilabolide and Jatanolides/Jatamansone as main ingredients. Preclinical studies prove the neuroprotective role of these herbs due to reduction in neuronal damage by free radicals and restoration of calcium homeostasis [
