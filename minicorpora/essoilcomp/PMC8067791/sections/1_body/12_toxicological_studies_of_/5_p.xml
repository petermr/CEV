<p id="Par58">The artemisinin also showed genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity the genotoxic profile of in-vitro bacterial mutagenicity and an in-vivo bone marrow micronucleus test were conducted in mice. Concentrations of up to 300 g per plate in the bacterial assay, and doses of up to 845.6 mg/kg in the micronucleus test were shown to be without effect, and the compound can thus be regarded as devoid of genotoxic activity. Dihydroartemisinin, the principal metabolite of artemisinin showing embryo death and abnormalities in early pregnancy in-vitro and in-vivo experimental models. Oral administration of artemisinin can adversely affect post-implantation development at different periods of pregnancy (Boareto et al.
