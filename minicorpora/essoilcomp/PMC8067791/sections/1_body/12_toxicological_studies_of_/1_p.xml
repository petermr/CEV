<p id="Par54">Ogbole et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR252">2014</xref>) performed acute toxicity studies of hexane leaf extract of 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> using rats at a dose of 1000, 2000, 2500 mg/kg intraperitoneally. They measured and observed different parameters like food and fluid intake, which was decreased, whereas urine and fecal output increased. Hematological parameters viz red blood cells, white blood cells, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, packed cell volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, platelets, and lymphocytes showed some significant changes. The lethal dose (LD
 <sub>50</sub>) of the extract was found to be 2750 mg/kg body weight. Overall studies showed low toxicity in short time treatment. It was declared that 
 <italic>A. parviflora</italic> did not elicit any kind of harmful manifestations or demise in the acute toxic toxicity study, revealing that an LD
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 1 g/kg body weight (Paramakrishnan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR260">2012</xref>). On the other way, 
 <italic>A. nilagirica</italic> oil has been disclosed to be more toxic, evincing 100% mycelia inhibition of all test fungi (Sonker et al.
