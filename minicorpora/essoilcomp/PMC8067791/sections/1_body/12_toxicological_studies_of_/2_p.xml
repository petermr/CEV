<p id="Par55">The ethanolic extracts of aerial parts of 
 <italic>A. abyssinica</italic> and 
 <italic>A. inculta</italic> were studied for acute and chronic toxicity was done by Qureshi et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR276">1990</xref>). In 
 <italic>A. inculta</italic> extract showed no signs of toxicity however at a dose of 3 g/kg it showed CNS stimulation, rapid respiration, which might be due to the presence of bitter principles in the extract. During chronic toxicity studies, two animals were found to have eye inflammation; otherwise, no signs of any abnormality; and mortality was observed as compared to the control. This plant extract did not show any signs of a spermatotoxic effect. 
 <italic>A. abyssinica</italic> treated animals did not show visible toxicity, whereas at 3 g/kg some decreased locomotor activity. Chronic treatment with this extract, four female mice were found to be anemic. Alopecia was noticed for one male in its genital region, and one male animal suffered from forelimb inflammation and constipation. However, no significant and no weight gain and acute mortality were observed up to 3 g/kg p.o but a significant spermatotoxic effect was observed.
