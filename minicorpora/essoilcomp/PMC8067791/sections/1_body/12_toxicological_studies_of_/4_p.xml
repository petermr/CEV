These results indicated that once-daily oral administration of artesunate or artemether is relatively safe, presumably because the CNS is exposed transiently, whereas regular introduction either from depot i.m. injection of an oil-based drug or constant oral intake carries produces higher neurotoxic potential (Nontprasert et al.
