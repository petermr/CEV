<p id="Par56">In-vitro and in-vivo animals and human clinical studies revealed that the genus artemisia has artemisinin that showed reproductive toxicity and neurotoxicity which include hearing loss, ataxia, and tremor. This was confirmed when a 20 mg/kg/day of artemether was given i.m. to groups of 3 male Beagle dogs for 5 and 30 days, respectively. Symptoms of neurotoxicity were observed from test day 23 onwards that includes hypochromic, microcytic anemia. After 5 days neuropathic alteration like neuronal and secondary axonal damage occurs in the cerebellar roof, pontine and vestibular nuclei, and in the raphe/paralemniscal region. Neuronal damage was found in all animals at 40 and 80 mg/kg following i.m. treatment. At 20 mg/kg it showed minimal effects in 5/8 dogs only, demonstrating that this level was close to tolerated exposure (Nontprasert et al.
