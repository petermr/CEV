<p id="Par15">It has been reported that mugwort incorporating natural supplements and possesses potent antioxidant activity (Juteau et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">2002</xref>; Erel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2012</xref>). It is prominently preferred that the extracts of phenolic flavonoids parts of the 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> have found efficient antioxidant activity (Wright 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR367">2002</xref>; Albayrak et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2010</xref>). The rich amount of flavonoid indicates an immense level of antioxidant activity (Matvieieva et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR209">2019</xref>). It is also known that some flavonoid constituents are used in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, Alzheimer’s disease (Pradeep and Rengaswamy 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR273">2016</xref>) and also manifest antihyperlipidemic effects (Dib and Alaouri-faris 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2019</xref>). The important oil obtained from the stem part of mugwort has an influential larvicidal activity against 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> when used in small concentration, therefore, scrutinized as a natural larvicidal compound against some carrier-mediated illness and for pest management in food technology (Govindaraj and Kumari 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">2013</xref>). Mugwort essential oil is also confirmed for its insecticidal effect for 
 <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> (Herbst), 
 <italic>Collosobruchus maculates</italic> (F.), and 
 <italic>Rhyzopertha dominica</italic> (F.) (Tigno et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR346">2000</xref>; Sharifian et al.
