<p id="Par8">The essential oil obtained through aerial regions of 
 <italic>A. parviflora</italic> from Pauri Garhwal (Uttarakhand, India) was commenced to perceive β-caryophyllene (15.3%), camphor (11.4%), germacrene D (14.7%), artemisia ketone (7.8%), 1,8-cineole (5.8%) (Haider et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">2010</xref>; Tewari et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR343">2015</xref>). The chemical constituents of 
 <italic>A. parviflora</italic> Buch have been examined through Gas chromatography (GC), Gas chromatography–Mass spectroscopy (GC–MS) (Rana et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR283">2003</xref>). Twenty-two chemical constituents isolated from 
 <italic>A. parviflora</italic> accounts for more  than 72% of the oil obtained, (Brenda et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2007</xref>). The medicinally active constituents were β-caryophyllene (15.3%), germacrene-D (14.7%), camphor (11.4%), ketone derivatives (7.8%), 1,8 cineole (5.8%), α-copaene (2.6%), alcohol derivatives (2.6%), terpene-4-ol (2.3%), caryophyllene oxide (1.2%), α-pinene (1.1%), sabinyl acetate (1.1%), α-humulene (1.1%). The plant also possesses sesquiterpenes and coumarin such as articanin, flavone-jacosidin, and scopoletin. (Pandey and Singh

 <italic>A. parviflora</italic> Roxb were reported to be flavonoids, tannins, coumarins, phenols, alkaloids sterols/terpenoids, germacrene D (Brown
