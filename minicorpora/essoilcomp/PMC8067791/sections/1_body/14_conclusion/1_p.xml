<p id="Par69">Artemisia and its allied species have been traditionally and ethnopharmacologically used to treat many diseases such as diarrhoea, dysentery, cholera, diabetes, hypertension, inflammation, intestinal spasms, and liver diseases. Artemisia species contain diverse compounds whose principal chemical constituents are polyphenols and essential oils. The result showed a substantial conceivable quantitative and qualitative variation between essential oil contents of 
 <italic>A. nilagirica </italic>and 
 <italic>A. parviflora</italic>. These oils have been found to play an essential role in uncoupling of electron transport chain in a variety of bacterial species and can be used for food preservation and cosmetic preparations. They also contain coumarins, acetylenes, sesquiterpene, lactones, and a large number of phytoconstituents viz alcohols, phenols, flavonoids monoterpenes, and sesquiterpene derivatives. These species possess different pharmacological activities such as antineoplastic, antimalarial, insecticidal, antispasmodic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, antiepileptic and analgesic properties. Acute studies showed that the plant to be nontoxic or low toxic, whereas chronic use of the plant causes toxicity. In this review, we have tried to abridge the pertinent findings, rational approaches, and innovative development regarding the ethnopharmacological activities of genus artemisia and novel therapeutic compounds that emerged out from this genus which are used to control and cure various types of common as well as lethal kinds of human diseases. It has been seen that 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> is under clinical trial against COVID-19 disease, presently vast research is going against the treatment of this pandemic. If proved by researchers then chemical entities obtained from this genus will be cost effective, readily available, marvellous and will posssess persuasive therepeutic effect for combating against COVID-19.  This review can be used for further research investigations as well as clinical purposes in the development of novel medicinally efficacious and safer plant derived drugs for curing several kinds of illnesses.
