<p id="Par2">The genus Artemisia belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is one of the most prominent disseminated genera comprising of 500 diverse kinds found in Northern temperate regions of North America, Europe, and Asia (Bora and Sharma 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2011</xref>). The generic name ‘Artemisia’ is derived from ‘Artemis,’ which means Diana, a Greek Goddess. 
 <italic>Artemisia vulgaris</italic>, L. was employed as an essential remedy for women's sickness in folk medicament. The genus has been certified for its remedial, curative, and therapeutic medicinal virtues, employed to synthesize essential oil used in medicine, food commodities, and cosmetics (Teixeira

 <italic>Artemisia nilagirica</italic> regionally designated as “Indian wormwood” pertains to the Asteraceae family (Suresh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR332">2011</xref>). It is popularly known as nagdona, which propagates up to 150 cm on nitrogenous soil in mountainous districts of India (Joshi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">2016</xref>). The leaves are 5–20 cm in height, peachy, soft, dark green on apex pale green with tiny white hairs on base. It is the medicinal plant that has been described to be pre-owned over ten decades employed to treat a large number of ailments; their signs and symptoms like inflammation, diabetes, malaria, anxiety, depression and several other microbial illnesses (Mohanty et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR219">2018</xref>). The plant has exploited to possess several biochemical constituents i.e., volatile oils and essential oil that is considered for the cure of diverse kinds of ailments and disabilities (Kishore et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178">2001</xref>; Singh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR314">2015</xref>; Mishra et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR216">2017</xref>). It contains a sesquiterpene lactone and flavonoids used as antimicrobial, insecticidal, along with anticancer activities, also applicable to cure neurological problems, dermal infections, inflammation, and to treat epileptic disorders (Banerji et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">1990</xref>; Shinde et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR385">2016</xref>). 
 <italic>A. nilagirica</italic> has confirmed to have ayurvedic as well as homeopathic remedial properties (Uniyal et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR348">1985</xref>). The juice of leaflets of this plant has been used for the treatments of intestinal worms, threatened abortion, vomiting, and rheumatism (Badoni et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2010</xref>; Panda et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR257">2018</xref>; Hijazi and Salhab 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">2010</xref>). Besides this, the genus artemisia species mentioned in traditional pharmacopeias of different ethnic groups. The numerous species like 
 <italic>A. cappilaries, A. Sacrotum, A. absinthium, A. herba alba, A. annua, A. vulgaris, A. tridentata, A. argentea, A. ludoviciana, A. Mexicana,</italic> etc posssess impotrant therapeutic properties (Yamahara and Kobayashi 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR369">1989</xref>). Mugwort leaves and stems are used therapeutically as an acrid pungent assimilative tonic, uterine stimulant and antirheumatic (Balunas and Kinghorn 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2005</xref>). Few species of the genus artemisia recommended for the treatment of gastrointestinal problems, hypertension (Zeb et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR379">2018</xref>), also possess potent immunomodulatory, antihypertensive, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory properties (Lian et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR194">2018</xref>; Mohanty et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR219">2018</xref>). Mugwort contains secondary metabolites like flavonoids, terpenoids, saponins, and polysaccharides, etc. Arglabin is a sesquiterpene lactone found mostly in all species of Artemisia, exhibits noticeable anticancer effects against varying tumor cell lines (Adekenov et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1982</xref>). Artemisinin isolated from 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> known as “qinghaosu” is sesquiterpene lactone endoperoxide used for the prevention and cure of malaria and cancer. Several analogs such as artesunic acid, artelinic acid, arteether as well as artemether can be semi synthesized and are extremely proficient against malaria induced by multidrug-resistant 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (Jain et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">2000</xref>; Abolaji et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2013</xref>). Artemisinin is present in leaves and flowers of the plant at a minimal amount; its dehydrated weight renders from 0.01 to 0.8%. Various procedures can be applied to increase the synthesis of artemisinin, hence, to yield it in an excess concentration to make it readily and smoothly approachable for the benefit of mankind.
