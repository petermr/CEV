<p id="Par35">The leaf extract obtained from the plant manifested to protect the human red blood cells (HRBC) with 74.63% at 20 µg/ml concentration and minimum hemolysis seen about 25.37% in a hypotonic solution as compared to standard drug diclofenac (Ghisan et al.

Moreover, at a cumulation of 50 µg/ml, the extract manifested extreme hemolysis of 52.89%, 47.11%, serially, and was collated with the reference drug that was &lt; 91.18% protection 16.68% hemolysis. The extract demonstrated membrane stabilization by suppressing hypotonicity and lyses of the erythrocyte membrane (Chou
