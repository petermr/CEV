<p id="Par26">Devmurari and Jivani (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2010</xref>) reported the anticancer activity of methanolic extract of 
 <italic>A. nilagirica</italic> in Swiss albino mice, and the result was found to contain significant activity when compared to standard drug vincristine. Whereas the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>Solanum nigrum</italic> along with species of genus artemisia such as 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic>, 
 <italic>A. nilagrica</italic>, 
 <italic>A. parviflora</italic> produces a prohibitory action on cell development, colony accumulation of the human breast, prostate, colorectal cell lines. The cytotoxicity in cancer cells was due to internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, caspase-3-mediated Poly (ADP-ribose) Polymerase (PARP), ribose polymerase cleavage. The in
 <italic>-</italic>vitro results showed the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>A. nilagirica</italic> has antineoplastic actions specifically in the breast, colon, and prostate (Devmurari and Jivani

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2010</xref>; Nawab et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR233">2011</xref>). The 
 <italic>A. nilagirica</italic> fraction of ethyl acetate-hexane against DLD-1 human cancer cell lines showed good activity. HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS discovery ascribes the recognition of cytotoxic agents that are to be implied for further preclinical testing (Sahu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR292">2018</xref>). Consumption of methanolic leaf extract of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> is considered to execute a wide impact in all the phases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hence, there has needed to elaborate the investigations for the employment of plant-originated agents as an effective anticancer compound in opposition to HCC for a peculiar drug evolution process (Emami et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2009</xref>; Nair and Varalakshmi 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR232">2011</xref>). Besides, artemisinins bioactive analogs can also be used as an antitumor agent against various types of cancerous cells, with lesser toxic effects on normal cells (Efferth 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2015</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2017</xref>; Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR380">2018</xref>; Numonov et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR248">2019</xref>). The research on the bioactivity of different constituents of Artemisia species constituents has a good therapeutic against the treatment of cancer (Pezzuto 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR269">1997</xref>; Taherkhani 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR336">2015</xref>). Artemisia produces anti-angiogenic actions in tumor cell lines, and the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> inhibits the growth of MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 cell which at different concentrations for nearly 3 days at a dose of 20 g/ml and 25 g/ml caused 50% suppression in MDAMB-231 and MCF-7 cells respectively with control (Shoaib et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR309">2017</xref>; Ahamad et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2019</xref>). It was also expressed that some extracts of artemisia varieties evaluated manifested a prominent effect on ER-a-positive T47D cells and had a dual impact (stimulatory or prohibitory) on cell dissemination. Nevertheless, evaluation at concentration underneath 100 mM or for 24 h accentuates cell progress, evaluating with artemisia spp. extracts at concentrations beyond 100 mM for 72 h remarkably prohibited cell distribution. All extracts represented similar anti-cancer activity in a dose time-dependent pattern in HS578T cells. Whereas at lesser concentration growth of T47D cells, the prevent the growth of T47D cells at larger concentrations (&gt; 100 mg/ml) for 72 h were notably higher than those of HS578T cells (Kaji et al.

 <italic>A. fragrans, A. incana</italic>, 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic>, 
 <italic>A. spicigera,</italic> and 
 <italic>A. vulgaris.</italic> root, stem, leaf, and flower extracts on human embryonic kidney normal cell line (HEK293), and breast cancer cell line (MCF7) was determined using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay at concentrations (62.5, 125, 250, 500 μg/ml). Methanol extracts of leaf, stem, flower, and the root of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> and 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> displayed remarkable anticancer activity, and the flower part showed greater cytotoxicity on MCF7 cell with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 221.5 &gt; 500 μg/ml. Whereas the cytotoxic effect of 
 <italic>A. absinthium, A. vulgaris, A. incana</italic> against MCF7 was 10–40% higher than HEK293 cells. 
 <italic>A. spicigera</italic> and 
 <italic>A. fragrans</italic> were not able to demonstrate any cytotoxic effects on both cell lines while 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> and 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> might have a higher new anticancer compound (Kaji et al.
