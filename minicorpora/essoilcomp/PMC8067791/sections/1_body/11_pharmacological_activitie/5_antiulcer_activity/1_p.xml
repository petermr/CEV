<p id="Par23">A peptic ulcer is increasing worldwide due to the emanation of unhygienic food and contaminated dietary supplements that adversely influence the health of human beings. 
 <italic>Helicobacter pylori,</italic> one of the major causative microorganisms of duodenal ulcers, accounts for an inflammatory effect in gastric mucosa by enhancing the formation of cytokines, therefore, developing ulcer production (Zapata-Colindres et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR208">2013</xref>; Mohanty et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR219">2018</xref>). Freeze-dried ethanolic extracts obtained from upper segments of 
 <italic>A. nilagirica</italic> were ascertained for gastric antiulcer effects on rats. Ulceration was actuated by ethanol–hydrochloric acid and a 500 mg/kg concentration of extract defended the animal from gastric ulcer response. It has been stated that the 500 mg/kg concentration has a paramount level of gastric protection, mucus content was enhanced in proteins, which give rise to antiulcer action. Cimetidine was used as a control, which was not able to manifest any response on mucus secretion in the animal model (Suresh et al.

 <italic>A. nilagirica</italic> possesses many essential oils, as discussed earlier and these oils have an antiulcer effect as well as gastroprotective action, which was evidenced by its in-vitro study on rats (Moraes et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR222">2009</xref>; Baananou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2013</xref>). It was also authenticated that extracts of 
 <italic>A. nilagirica</italic> on ulcer produced rats showed to prevent the ulcer formation by increasing the mucus concentration (Braquet et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">1988</xref>; Mohanty et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR219">2018</xref>).
