<p id="Par22">The phytochemical assessments of extracts the analysis expressed the presence of flavonoids, terpenoids, phenols, alkaloids, quinines, and tannins (Tajehmiri et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR206">2019</xref>). Despite this, saponins and amino acids were found in methanol and  ethanol extracts whereas carbohydrates specifically lie within methanol extracts, and glycosides hydrolyzable tannins were not found in the extracts. The susceptibility test showed the suppression of phytopathogens in hexane extracts. The phytopathogen of petroleum ether extract resulted in less suppression (8–10 mm) in correlation to other extracts (10–14 mm). The phytochemical assessments of entire extracts with petroleum ether revealed that it contains alkaloid derivatives (Erdogrul 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2002</xref>; Shafaghata et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR303">2009</xref>). Therefore, it is recommended that digression of alkaloid abundance in petroleum ether may be the source of reduced stimulation in phytopathogens. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) analysis result of alkaloids against pathogens (Torres et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR347">2002</xref>; Raghavendra et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR278">2008</xref>) such as gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria denoted the availability of a wide range of antibiotic components. The methanol extracts demonstrated maximum suppression at the minimal concentration for the majority of the clinical pathogens as compared to other extracts. The MIC of methanol extract limits from 32 to 64 µg/ml for 
 <italic>Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus vulgaris</italic>. The phytochemical assessment of menthol extract demonstrated the existence of the majority of the components like terpenoids, alkaloids, flavonoids, phenols, amino acid, and tannins. Besides this, it has evidenced that alkaloids, amino acids, flavonoids, phenols, and tannin are recommended to be active antimicrobials (Brandao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">1997</xref>; Chakraborty and Brantner 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">1999</xref>; Shaheen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR305">2003</xref>; Chowdhury et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2008</xref>). Extracts of 
 <italic>A. nilagirica</italic> intimated a wide range of antibacterial effects on the assessed microorganisms. Hexane extract demonstrated maximum prohibitory efficacy for the phytopathogens, as compared to methanol extract on 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia faecalis, and Klebsiella pnumoniae</italic> (Ahameethunisa and Hopper 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2010</xref>). Some specific reports reveal the antibacterial effects of 
 <italic>A. nilagirica</italic> leaf extract and showed that 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> was more active than 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (gram-negative bacteria) whereas against gram-positive bacteria 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus</italic> was found to be less active
 <italic>.</italic> The activity result suggests that the 
 <italic>A. nilagirica</italic> extracts have shown profound activity as compared to the root extract of 
 <italic>Aristolochia indica</italic> (Rao et al.
