 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> is one of the fatal diseases involving a large number of the human population and drug resistance also occurs (Jimenez-Arellanes et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">2014</xref>). A large number of secondary plant metabolites are confirmed to retain antitubercular activity (Negi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR235">2010</xref>). It was seen that methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>A. capillaries</italic> and hydroquinoneursolic acid have shown inhibitory actions against many strains of 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (MTB by using MGITâ„¢ 960 resazurin assay. Phytomolecules have been additionally assessed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Hydroquinone (HQ) and ursolic acid (UA) stops the growth of both vulnerable resistant species of 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (Jyoti et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">2016</xref>). Some antimycobacterial activity reports that 20%, 40%, 70%, and 96% ethanolic extracts of the root of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> decrease 100% growth inhibition of 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> strains with 96% ethanolic extract. However, the mechanism of the plant is needed for prevention as well as control of disease (Hojageldiyev et al.
