<p id="Par47">It was investigated by some researchers about the gastroprotective activity of an isopropanol extract from the aerial segments of 
 <italic>A. princeps</italic> (IPAP) and designed as a gastroprotective floating tablet of IPAP (IPAP-FR) and obtained gastroprotective results against the excessive gastric mucosa secretion (Kim et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR177">2017</xref>). The medicinally active constituent that is scoparone (6,7-dimethoxycoumarin), a coumarin-derived component obtained from 
 <italic>Hericium erinaceus</italic> with 
 <italic>A. capillaries</italic>, confirms an efficacious gastroprotective impact on gastric secretion induced by HCl/ethanol in rats (Son et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR322">2015</xref>). Aqueous extract of 
 <italic>A. capillaris</italic> (AEAC) against the gastric mucosal lesion (Yeo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR371">2018</xref>). The therapeutic potency of AEAC was seen by employing the gastric ulcer index and histological assessments, the mucosal impairment was indeed commanded by therapy with 200 or 400 mg/kg AEAC. It has not possessed acid-nullifying property in-vitro unable to stop histamine release in HMC-1 mast cells. In gastric mucosa, AEAC, furthermore, outstandingly deprived lipid peroxide production by superoxide dismutase (SOD) stimulation. AEAC also helps in the formation of proinflammatory cytokines, namely interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) via nuclear component kappa B (NF-κB) downregulation (Soufli et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR324">2016</xref>; Haq et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">2019</xref>). The results suggest that AEAC prohibits inflammation continues as well as perpetuates oxidant/antioxidant homeostasis, in a gastro-protection to HCl/ethanol-instigated gastric and can be availed as a proficient drug for gastritis and gastric ulcer.
