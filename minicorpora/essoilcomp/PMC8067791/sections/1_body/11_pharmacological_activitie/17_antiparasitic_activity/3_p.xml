 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> has proficient flavors, thus has very potent actions in animals including ruminants (Beigh and Ganai

The chemical constituent ivermectin have investigated and identified and later on was considered as a strong newly emerged antiparasitic compound at Merck Shape and Dome Research Laboratories (MDRL), afterward chemically altered avermectin known as ivermectin, have been developed and found to be efficacious against parasitic infection (Burg et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">1979</xref>; Chabala et al.
