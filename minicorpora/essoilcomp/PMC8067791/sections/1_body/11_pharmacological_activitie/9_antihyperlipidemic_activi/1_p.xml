<p id="Par29">Hyperlipidemia occurs due to lipid biotransformation induced by the increase of plasma concentration of various lipid lipoprotein that results in cardiac disease. It is accounted for as elevated serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, very-low-density lipoproteins, low-density lipoproteins, high-density lipoproteins (TC, TG, VLDL, LDL, HDL) which are responsible for congestive heart failure, cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, cardiac strokes, atherosclerosis, coronary artery syndrome pancreatitis (Konda et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR180">2013</xref>). Hypercholesterolemia is commonly accredited to be the crucial hazardous aspect of the progression of cardiovascular disorders. It has been assessed that hypercholesterolemia is the source of the augmented development of ROS. Oxidative stress produced by ROS imparts a principal role in the diagnosis of atherosclerosis as well as in coronary heart disorder. Considerable attention has been paid to naturally occurring compounds and their role in up-gradation for health fitness. The cholesterol-reducing property of comestible plants has been well measured and numerous plants have found profitable in, mitigating plasma cholesterol extent and raising the safety parameters (Kruth

 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> extract produces hypolipidemic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant properties and might be used for the treatment of atherosclerosis as well as cardiovascular-related diseases (Zhao et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR282">1996</xref>; Yokozawa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR372">2003</xref>). Aqueous extract of the root can exhibit hypolipidemic activity same as the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as rosuvastatin (Blois
