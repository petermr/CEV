<p id="Par30">Epilepsy is a prevalent mental ailment; common manifestations are seizures or convulsions. A disequilibrium between the aggravating overwhelming neurotransmitters is liable for the principal cause of seizures (Santilna et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR296">2014</xref>). It influences around 7 million population in India and 50 million globally; around 40% of them found to be women (Kumar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR188">2012</xref>). About 50–80% of people living with epilepsy are manageable with presently receivable anticonvulsant drugs, but these medications are still not capable enough to cure convulsions entirely in about 10–20% of the patients with epilepsy (Nsour et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR247">2000</xref>). Most of the prescribed drugs by registered medical practitioners availed as antiepileptic compounds have deleterious influence sometimes life-threatening human situations are also realized by patients who are victims of epilepsy (Mittal et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR217">2011</xref>; Sharma et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR307">2013</xref>). That’s why there is a great demand to innovate an alternative subsidiary antiepileptic agent from naturally occurring sources with potent therapeutic effects and lesser side effects (Smith and Bleck 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR318">1991</xref>; Nsour et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR247">2000</xref>; Loscher and Schmidt 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR199">2006</xref>). The anxiolytic and anticonvulsant activities of the plant 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> was performed using the elevated plus-maze test and the Marble-Burying test (EPMMBT) diazepam 2 mg/kg used as standard. The methanol extracts produce antiseizure activities, elevating the time of quiescence for the initiating of the initial convulsion in all the assessments (Almeida et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2013</xref>). It has been noticed that ethanol extract of some species of the genus artemisia such as 
 <italic>A. capillaris</italic> Herba (AC) has remarkable anticonvulsant action in electroshock as well as pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) seizure model. In comparison to diazepam, AC (100–200 mg/kg) did not modulate the locomotor performance and proceeding duration on the rota-rod, which denotes that it is unable to produce hangover, myorelaxation as well as not be sleep-inducing. Such dissimilarity between AC and diazepam is advantageous, stipulating that sleep induction and sedation is a general adverse effect of a few of the GABAergic neuronal anticonvulsants. Esculetin (ECT), therapeutically active medicinal constituents present in AC, imparting an anticonvulsant effect same as in the case of AC, which designates that the effect of AC is as an outcome of ECT (Novack et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR246">1978</xref>; Bum et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2001</xref>; Obniska et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR250">2006</xref>; Woo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR366">2011</xref>). This has also been observed that ursolic acid, carnosolole, anolic acid intimated remarkable anticonvulsant effects against PTZ-induced seizures in mice. Oleanolic acid, carnosolursolic acid developed a dose-reliant enhancement in the duration of onset of tonic–clonic seizures, as a result, reduced the time of seizures (Khan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">2016</xref>).
