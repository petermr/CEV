<p id="Par31">Malaria is one of the biggest life-intimidating diseases caused by Anopheles mosquitoes affecting a large number of populations globally (Barradell and Fitton 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1995</xref>; Carter and Mendis 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2002</xref>). It was studied that the effectiveness of antimalarial activity declared by selecting six different leaf extracts of 
 <italic>A. nilagirica</italic> in solvents (
 <italic>n</italic>-ethanol, petroleum ether, hexane, chloroform), besides this, methanol aqueous organic leaf extracts of 
 <italic>A. nilagirica</italic> (Clarke) Pamp was found to be effective for Plasmodium 
 <italic>falciparum</italic> (malarial parasite) (Czechowski et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2019</xref>). The antiplasmodial activity obtained the highest 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) after 32 h of gestation. This study reveals that the methanolic extract of leaf of 
 <italic>A. nilagirica</italic> showed an in
 <italic>-</italic>vitro antiplasmodial effect on 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> strain (FCR-3). In addition to this, the characterization of the medicinally active component from leaf extract may contribute to a molecule for malaria; their in-vivo studies also proved (Suberu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR329">2013</xref>). It can be concluded that 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> leaf extract has potent antimalarial activity against the 
 <italic>Plasmodium yoelii</italic>. Due to resemblances between 
 <italic>P. yoeli</italic> and human malaria parasites like 
 <italic>Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium falciparum,</italic> and 
 <italic>Plasmodium yoelii</italic> can be utilized as another in-vivo model for human malaria (Carlton et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2002</xref>; Kodippili et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR179">2011</xref>).
