<p id="Par33">On another way, artemisinin obtained from 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> is a potent antimalarial agent against chloroquine-resistant malaria. Root level study was taken into consideration to ascertain the antiparasitic action of an 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> in ethanolic leaf extract (AVELE) against 
 <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> ANKA murine malaria model against falciparum malaria (Bamunuarachchi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2013</xref>). Dichloromethane extracts of both species of 
 <italic>A. spicigera</italic> and 
 <italic>A. scoparia were</italic> reported to contain an antimalarial effect with IC
 <sub>50</sub> at 0.7780.999Â mg/ml for 
 <italic>A. spicigera and A. scoparia</italic>. 
 <italic>A. spicigera</italic> was found more potent rather than 
 <italic>A. scoparia</italic> (Afshar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2011</xref>). The hydroalcoholic aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>A. annua </italic>L. were prominently found to be effective on malaria and can be utilized by inhabitants on a worldwide level to diagnose this disease, particularly in endemic regions where there is not sufficient budget to purchase potent new therapeutically active medicines (Mueller et al.
