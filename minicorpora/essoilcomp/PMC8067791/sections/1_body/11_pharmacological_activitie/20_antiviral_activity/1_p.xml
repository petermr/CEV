<p id="Par48">In our review, we have briefly concise the antiviral properties from various naturally occurring resources and herbal remedies in contrast to a few distinguished viral microorganisms accompanying coronavirus (CoV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), measles virus (MV), dengue virus (DENV), enterovirus 71 (EV71), hepatitis C virus (HCV), coxsackievirus (CV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza virus, herpes simplex virus along with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Karamoddini et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">2011</xref>; Lin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR195">2014</xref>). Here, we have principally emphasized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), as it is extremely and severely exploring conditions globally at present. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is an offbeat and unique virus that has stirred up enormously and profoundly globally, word wide to this current era (Cheng et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2007</xref>). There is no antiviral remedy or vaccines that have been achievable as long as for prevention of this contingent as well as fatal ailment, which can be prevented by obeying social distancing and taking adequate and preliminary precautions exclusively (Yang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR370">2020</xref>). The corona viridae dynasty, an enwrapped RNA virus dynasty, in addition to copious specifically, human coronaviruses (HCoV), HCoV causes respiratory problems such as bronchiolitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia, with decreased immunity (Geller et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">2012</xref>). Dissemination of coronaviruses on account of infected drained superficies has been presumed accompanying auto-exegesis of the mucous integument of the mouth, nostrils along with eyes, reiterating the ponderability of comprehensive and sightedness discerning of coronavirus stubbornness on defunct superficies (Kampf et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">2020</xref>). Vero E6 (BJ001, BJ006) sorts of SARS-CoV treated with 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> that is a Chinese medicinal herb (Li et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR193">2005</xref>; Cheng et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2007</xref>). Some crucial and conspicuous species of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> in conjunction with 
 <italic>Pyrrosia lingua</italic> and 
 <italic>Lindera aggregate</italic> demonstrated the anti-SARS-CoVÂ activity (Yang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR370">2020</xref>). Adscititious, several kinds of anti-coronaviral compounds described and recognized out of possession of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) herbs, albeit the mode of functioning of these newly identified compounds, were not accomplished till date. The extracts prepared from 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> plant might be given in the form of infusion to accomplish an abundant range of antiviral properties notably against coronavirus, dengue virus, and herpes simplex virus (Mesa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR213">2015</xref>). Moreover, global studies reported that many medicinal herbal ingredients have revealed antiviral activities against coronaviruses and their primary mechanism of action seems to be through the inhibition of viral replication (Jassim and Naji 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153">2003</xref>). China has commonly used traditional Chinese medicinal herbs for the treatment of SARS effectively in many cases. However, there is no substantial evidence yet on the clinical effectiveness of these for Covid-19 infected patients (Luo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR200">2020</xref>). The genus artemisia revealed that traditional herbal remedies that emerged for this genus are productive and worthwhile against SARS-CoV infectious ailments (Haq et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">2020</xref>).
