  <p>Percentage of inhibition (IP) of local lesions on leaves of tretaed host plants inoculated with tobacco mosaic virus compared with control plants on days 3, 5, and 7 postinoculation (dpi). Prior to inoculation, treated plants were sprayed with essential oil (EO) or hydrosol (H) of 
   <italic>H. perforatum</italic> ssp. 
   <italic>veronense</italic> for two consecutive days. Error bars show the standard deviation of triplicate analyses; significant differences were determined by
