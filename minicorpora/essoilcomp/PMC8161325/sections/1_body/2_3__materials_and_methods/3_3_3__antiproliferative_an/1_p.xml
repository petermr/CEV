<p>The antiproliferative activity of the essential oil and hydrosol of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>veronense</italic> was determined on cancer cells cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), human colon cancer cell line (HCT116) and human osteosarcoma cell line (U2OS) as described by Fredotović et al. [
 <xref rid="B72-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. The cells were donated to us by prof. Janoš Terzić from the School of Medicine, University of Split. Antiproliferative activity was determined using the MTS-based CellTiter 96
 <sup>®</sup> Aqueous Assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Cells were grown in a CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> until they reached 80% confluency. Cells were then counted using the automatic handheld cell counter (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) to check cell number and viability. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates and treated with serially diluted oil and hydrolate. 5000 cells were seeded in each well. Cells were grown for 48 h, after which 20 µL of MTS tetrazolium reagent (Promega) was added to each well. After three hours of incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, absorbance was measured using a 96-well plate reader (EL808, Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT, USA). Measurements were performed in four replicates for each concentration and IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated from three independent experiments using GraFit 6 data analysis software (Erithacus, East Grinstead, UK).
