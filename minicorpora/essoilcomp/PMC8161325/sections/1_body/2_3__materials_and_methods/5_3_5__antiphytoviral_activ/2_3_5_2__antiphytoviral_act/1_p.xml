<p>Essential oil (EO) (final concentration adjusted to 500 ppm) or hydrosol (undiluted) were applied as a spray solution to the leaves of local host plants for two consecutive days prior to virus inoculation and then rubbed with virus inocula (10 plants, 2 leaves per plant) as described by Vuko et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Control plants were sprayed with distilled water and inoculated with virus inocula. Lesions were counted on the third, fifth, and seventh day post inoculation and inhibition of local lesions was calculated by comparing the average number of viral lesions on the leaves of treated and control plants according to the formula: IP = [(C − T)/C] × 100, where IP = inhibition of local lesions in %, C = mean number of local lesions on the leaves of the control group; T = mean number of local lesions on the leaves of the group treated with EO/hydrosol. Results are presented as the average of three replicate experiments.
