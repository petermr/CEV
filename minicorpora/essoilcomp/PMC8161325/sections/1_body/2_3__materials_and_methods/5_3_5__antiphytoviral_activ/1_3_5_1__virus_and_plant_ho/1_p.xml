<p>Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) was propagated in a systemic host, 
 <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic> L. cv. Samsun. Systemically infected leaves were ground in 0.06 molL
 <sup>−1</sup> phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (1:1, 
 <italic>w/v</italic>), and centrifuged at low speed to prepare the virus inoculum. This inoculum was diluted with inoculation buffer to yield 10–50 lesions per inoculated leaf of the local host plant 
 <italic>Datura stramonium</italic> L. Prior to virus inoculation leaves were dusted with silicon carbide (Sigma-Aldrich). Care was taken to ensure that the experimental plants were as uniform in size as possible.
