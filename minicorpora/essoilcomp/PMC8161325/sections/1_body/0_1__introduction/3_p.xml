<p>The antiproliferative activity of various plant extracts and essential oils has been reported for several 
 <italic>Hypericum</italic> species and their individual constituents, but as mentioned, the same has never been done with hydrosol. The essential oil from 
 <italic>H. hircinum</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>majus</italic> showed moderate antiproliferative activity against human glioblastoma (T98G), human prostatic adenocarcinoma (PC3), human squamous carcinoma (A431) and mouse melanoma (B16-F1) cell lines. The possible mechanism behind the antiproliferative activity in glioblastoma and melanoma cells could be the induction of authophygy [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. França et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] showed that hexane extract and phloroglucinol derivatives obtained from 
 <italic>H. brasiliense</italic> are potent inhibitors of ovarian (OVCAR-03 and NCIADR/RES) and melanoma (UACC-62) cell division. Three endemic 
 <italic>Hypericum</italic> species from Canary Islands (
 <italic>H. reflexum</italic>, 
 <italic>H. canariense</italic> and 
 <italic>H. grandifolium</italic>) showed potent cytotoxic activity against human melanoma cell line (A375), breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MDA-MB 231) and colon cancer cell line (HCT116). The authors hypothesize that a synergy between different compounds, rather than the single most dominant compound from the essential oil, is responsible for this activity [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The relationship between the potent antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>H. montbretii</italic> and 
 <italic>H. organifolium</italic> leaf and flower extracts and the antiproliferative effect on A549 lung cancer and Hela cervical adenocarcinoma cells was demonstrated by Güzey et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Interestingly, all the extracts showed a different mode of antiproliferative action and that too at different concentrations. Probably, the reason for this lies in the differences in the phytochemical profile of the tested extracts.
