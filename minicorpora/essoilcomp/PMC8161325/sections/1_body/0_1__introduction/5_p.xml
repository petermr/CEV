<p>Natural antiphytoviral preparations are a new area of research in the field of plant protection against viruses. We hypothesized that the essential oil of 
 <italic>Hypericum</italic> species may have antiphytoviral activity, which is related to findings that essential oils of aromatic plant species, especially sesquiterpene-rich oils, inhibit viral infection on host plants [

 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>veronense</italic> faces in its natural environment; therefore, the volatiles could help the plant overcome various environmental and biological stressors, including pathogen attack. Although the antiphytoviral activity of hydrosols has not yet been investigated, we assume that, in addition to essential oils, hydrosols can also trigger a response to viral infections in plant systems. This is related to the fact that hydrosols, as condensed water vapors, contain dissolved essential oil components and more polar volatile compounds that are soluble in water [
