<p>In addition to the chemical composition, our team also investigated the biological activities in terms of antiproliferative, antioxidant and antiphytoviral activity of both the essential oil and hydrosol of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>veronense</italic>. Due to the difference in solubility in water, the overall composition as well as the biological activity differs between the lipophilic and hydro fractions. Comparison of the efficacy between these fractions may give us an insight into the new biological activities and possible applications of this traditional medicinal plant. To the best of our knowledge, the antiproliferative and antiphytoviral activities of the essential oil of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> have not been studied before, and moreover, this is the first report dealing with these activities of hydrosols of aromatic plant species in general. Hydrosols from various plants are gaining importance in cosmetology, aromatherapy, traditional pharmacy, food industry and plant protection, so their potential use should therefore be further investigated.
