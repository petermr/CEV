<p>Plants belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Hypericum</italic> are commonlyused to treat conditions caused by oxidative stress, such as skin wounds, eczema, and inflammation, due to their antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Since literature results showed that phenolic extracts of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> have higher antioxidant activity than many aromatic and medicinal plants such as 
 <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic> Mill., 
 <italic>Verbena officinalis</italic> L., 
 <italic>Taraxacum officinale</italic> complex, 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Pulmonaria officinalis</italic> L. [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], ORAC and DPPH assays were performed with both hydrosol and essential oil of 
 <italic>H.p.</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>veronense</italic> to gain insight into the antioxidant potential of lipophilic and hydrophilic fractions of this plant species.
