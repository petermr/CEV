 <italic>Hypericum perforatum</italic> L. or St. John’s wort (Clusiaceae) is a perennial rhizomatous herb traditionally used in herbal medicine throughout the world. Although various activities of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> extracts have been reported such as antibacterial, antiviral, wound healing, antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, antitumor, antiangiogenic, and immunomodulatory activity [

 <xref rid="B2-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Flora Croatica Database (FCD) [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] describes two subspecies of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> in Croatia: ssp. 
 <italic>perforatum</italic> L. and ssp. 
 <italic>veronense</italic> (Schrank) H. Lindb. In Italy, Pignatti [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] describes a third subspecies, 
 <italic>angustifolium</italic> (DC.) Gaudin. FCD considers ssp. 
 <italic>angustifolium</italic> to be a synonym of ssp. 
 <italic>veronense</italic> and the Flora of Europe [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] describes only the species 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> with two different varieties (var. 
 <italic>angustifolium</italic> and var. 
 <italic>microphyllum</italic>), which points us to a particular taxonomic problem with this species. 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>veronense</italic> grows in the eumediterranean climate under extreme environmental conditions, such as high solar radiation and drought, in contrast to ssp. 
 <italic>angustifolium</italic>, which grows in more temperate climates. In addition to the described differences in morphological characteristics, such as larger and broader leaves of ssp. 
 <italic>angustifolium</italic> compared to ssp. 
 <italic>veronense</italic> [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], a different phytochemical composition of these subspecies can also be expected due to the different environmental conditions. The term chemophenetics, has recently been proposed for the field of studies aimed at the exploitation of characteristic arrays of specialized natural products of plant taxa [
 <xref rid="B15-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In general, the free volatiles of the genus 
 <italic>Hypericum</italic> have been extensively studied and they also show significant variation in volatile profile. Germacrene D, α-pinene, 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene, 
 <italic>2</italic>-methyloctane and 
 <italic>n</italic>-nonane were among the major components in essential oils of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> reported by many authors [
 <xref rid="B16-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In this study, the essential oil composition and, for the first time, the hydrosol composition of Croatian 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>veronense</italic> were investigated, especially with regard to the comparison of volatile components between them. Our results of phytochemical profiling were compared with literature profiles of this species with the aim of providing data useful in distinguishing 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>veronense</italic> from ssp. 
 <italic>angustifolium</italic>.
