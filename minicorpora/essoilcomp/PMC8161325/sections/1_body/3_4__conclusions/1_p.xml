<p>Monoterpenes and oxygenated monoterpenes dominate both essential oil and hydrosol samples of 
 <italic>Hypericum perforatum</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>veronense</italic>. Phytochemical profiling of volatile compounds of 
 <italic>Hypericum</italic> species may be useful to distinguish 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>veronense</italic> from ssp. 
 <italic>angustifolium</italic>. In addition to the pronounced antioxidant activity of the essential oil of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>veronense</italic>, the exceptional antiproliferative activity of hydrosol was demonstrated for the first time. Another new finding is that, in addition to essential oils, hydrosols from aromatic plant species have the potential for the development of natural antiphytoviral preparations. The results presented in this study imply further research regarding potential applications of 
 <italic>Hypericum</italic> species.
