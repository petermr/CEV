<p>The volatile compounds in the essential oil (EO) and hydrosol of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>veronense</italic> were analysed by GC-MS analysis and are listed in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-01014-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> in the order of their elution from the column. The total oil yield was 0.09%, based on the dry weight of the samples. Forty-five compounds, divided into eight classes, and twenty-five compounds, divided into six classes, were identified in the EO and hydrosol, respectively, accounting for 85.25% and 72.21% of the total oil and hydrosol. In terms of compound classes, monoterpenes (24.59%) and oxygenated monoterpenes (25.7%) dominate the EO and hydrosol samples, respectively. α-Pinene is the dominant compound in EO (16.58%) and is one of the more abundant components (8.69%) in the overall hydrosol composition (
 <xref rid="plants-10-01014-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Maggi and Ferretti found that the flower oil of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> L. ssp. 
 <italic>veronense</italic> (Schrank) Ces. from central Italy contains mainly α-pinene (35.6%), followed by 2-methyloctane (16.9%) [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In contrast, no monoterpenes were identified in the oil composition of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>angustifolium</italic> from southeastern France, and oxygenated monoterpenes accounted for only 2.6% of the total oil composition [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Besides the dominant α-pinene, β-pinene (3.67%) and β-thujone (3.24%) stand out among the monoterpenoids in the oil composition of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>veronense</italic> (
 <xref rid="plants-10-01014-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, these compounds were not identified (β-thujone) in the hydrosol composition or had low content (β-pinene) (
 <xref rid="plants-10-01014-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The proportion of the oxygenated monoterpenes myrtenol (12.33%) and linalool (4.56%) is significantly higher in the hydrosol than in the oil sample, as is the proportion of myrcene (2.55%), limonene (2.63%), α-terpineol (3.57%), β-cyclocitral (2.38%) and camphor (2.17%). Oxygenated monoterpenes, with myrtenol as the most abundant hydrosol constituent, are the predominant class of compounds in the overall hydrosol composition (
 <xref rid="plants-10-01014-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The sesquiterpenes in EO consisted mainly of hydrocarbons (17.27%), while the oxygenated fractions were represented by 12.51%. (E)-Caryophyllene (9.52%) and caryophyllene oxide (7.69%) are the major sesquiterpenes in the composition of EO. These two compounds were also identified in the hydrosol, but the proportion was much lower (2.25% and 0.76%, respectively) (
 <xref rid="plants-10-01014-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Compared to our results, the essential oil of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>angustifolium</italic> from South Serbia contained a higher proportion of sesquiterpenes (44.4%), with caryophyllene oxide (15.3%) as the main component, and the content of monoterpenes was low (6.2%) [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] similar to 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>angustifolium</italic> from France [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The non-terpenoid compound n-Nonane is the second most important component in terms of total oil composition, accounting for 13.59%; in hydrosol it accounts for 4.29% of the composition (
 <xref rid="plants-10-01014-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This aliphatic compound has been reported by many authors as one of the main constituents in the essential oils of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic>, although in the composition of EO of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> from Serbia the percentage of 
 <italic>n</italic>-nonane was much lower [
 <xref rid="B16-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The monoterpenoids carvacrol and thymol are identified as the major phenolic compounds in hydrosol (9.87 and 3.48%, respectively) (
 <xref rid="plants-10-01014-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). With respect to the major components previously identified in the oils of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic>, two chemotypes of the oil can be roughly distinguished [
 <xref rid="B16-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The essential oils containing germacrene D, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene and caryophyllene oxide as major components belong to one chemotype group, while the second group comprises the oils dominated by α-pinene and/or 2-methyloctane [
 <xref rid="B16-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. According to the literature results, the components listed in the first chemotype group dominate in the volatile profile of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> from Serbia (germacrene D and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene) and in the volatile profile of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>angustifolium</italic> from South Serbia (caryophyllene oxide), but also in the composition of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>angustifolium</italic> from France, noting that the very high content of spathulenol in this oil could be due to germacrene D and bicyclogermacrene, which are known fragile molecules that can be converted into spathulenol [
 <xref rid="B16-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In contrast to ssp. 
 <italic>perforatum</italic> and ssp. 
 <italic>angustifolium</italic> and in view of our results (
 <xref rid="plants-10-01014-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>veronense</italic> from Croatia belongs to the chemotype group comprising the oils dominated by α-pinene. Moreover, in the oil of ssp. perforatum from Italy, β-caryophyllene (24.4%) and 2,6-dimethylheptane (18.2%) were the main components, while the same authors described α-pinene (35.6%) as the main component in the flower oil of ssp. 
 <italic>veronense</italic> [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The above results go along with the idea of chemophenetics, a term recently described by Zidorn [
 <xref rid="B15-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The plant organ used for extraction, the phenological stage of the harvested material, the altitude of the growing area, the genotype and different types of biotic and abiotic stressors have already been discussed as factors influencing the chemical variations in 
 <italic>Hypericum</italic> species [
