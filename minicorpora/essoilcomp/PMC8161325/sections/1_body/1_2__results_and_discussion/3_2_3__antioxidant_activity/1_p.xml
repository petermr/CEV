<p>To determine the antioxidant potential, ORAC and DPPH were performed on two extracts of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>veronense</italic>, hydrosol and essential oil. The results presented in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-01014-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> show higher antioxidant activity of essential oil than hydrosol in both ORAC and DPPH methods. Phenolic monoterpenoids are important antioxidant compounds as described by Llana-Ruiz-Cabello et al. [
 <xref rid="B59-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] who showed that carvacrol and its mixture with thymol exhibited protection against induced oxidative stress at low concentrations; however, at high concentrations they induced rather than prevented oxidative stress. These results could explain the lower antioxidant activity of the hydrosol of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>veronense</italic> compared to the essential oil, considering the amount of thymol and carvacrol in these extracts (
 <xref rid="plants-10-01014-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Aazza et al. [
 <xref rid="B65-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] reported a similar antioxidant activity (282.6 μmol/L) for Salvia officinalis hydrosol. Quassinti et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] tested the antioxidant activity (DPPH) of essential oil for the species 
 <italic>Hypericum hircinum</italic> L. subsp. 
 <italic>majus</italic> and reported an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.68 mg/mL, which is higher than the result we reported. This could be due to the high content of the compound 
 <italic>cis</italic>-β-guaiene, which was the main compound in the essentail oil of 
 <italic>H. hircinum</italic>. Zardi-Bergaoui et al. [
 <xref rid="B66-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] studied the essential oil of 
 <italic>Pulicaria vulgaris</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>dentata</italic> and reported that the essential oil from the aerial parts had a significantly higher content of 
 <italic>cis</italic>-β-guaiene than the root parts. Moreover, the aerial parts showed higher antioxidant activity, which, considering the content of 
 <italic>cis</italic>-β-guaiene, could explain the higher antioxidant activity described for the species 
 <italic>H. hircinum</italic> L. subsp. 
 <italic>majus</italic>. Bentayeb et al. [
 <xref rid="B67-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] evaluated the antioxidant activity for several essential oils of plants commonly used as spices. The results (
 <xref rid="plants-10-01014-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) showed that the essential oil of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>veronense</italic> had higher antioxidant activity than dill (seed), rosemary, basil and lemongrass and comparable activity to thyme essential oil. Previously, Kratchanova et al. [
 <xref rid="B68-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] reported antioxidant activity for acetone and water extracts of St. John’s wort. Acetone extracts showed higher antioxidant activity (1141 ± 93 μmol/g DW) than water extracts (629 ± 41 μmol/g DW). Napoli et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] reported ORAC values for antioxidant activity of ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> of 890 μmol/g DW, which were lower than the acetone extracts reported by Kratchanova et al. It is possible that acetone extracts contain not only phenolic compounds but also other specialized metabolites such as essential oil components that contribute to the higher antioxidant activity. In conclusion, the essential oil of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>veronense</italic> exhibits considerable antioxidant activity that deserves further research.
