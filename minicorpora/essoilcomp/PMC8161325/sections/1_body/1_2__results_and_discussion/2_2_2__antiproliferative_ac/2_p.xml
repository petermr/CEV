<p>In contrast to hydrosol, the essential oil of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>veronense</italic> did not show significant antiproliferative activity. The fact that the essential oil was not tested as a fresh product could cause the evaporation of the main active ingredients and thus the lack of activity. We also cannot exclude that the composition of the oil, which is different from the hydrosol, and the concentrations of its constituents may be the reason for the differences in biological activity, and in this regard further studies of the antiproliferative activity of the fresh essential oil are possible. Among the oxygenated monoterpenes, the hydrosol contains a higher amount of camphor, α-terpineol and β-cyclocitral than the essential oil, and linalool and myrtenol are present as the two most dominant compounds (

 <xref rid="B41-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. It appears to play an important role in disrupting improper cell division and maintaining genome stability after genotoxic stress [
 <xref rid="B39-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Myrtenol is a monoterpene compound found in the essential oils of many medicinal plants and has long been used in traditional medicine to treat anxiety, gastrointestinal pain, inflammation and infection [

 <xref rid="B43-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. There is evidence of its antimicrobial [

 <xref rid="B45-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], but there are no data on its possible antiproliferative activity. In contrast to the essential oil, hydrosol is richer in phenolic compounds such as thymol and carvacrol, which are known to be the most active natural antioxidants. Thymol has been shown to be a compound that can inhibit the division of various cancer cells [

 <xref rid="B49-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Carvacrol is a phenolic monoterpenoid known for its antiangiogenic, analgesic, antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties [

 <xref rid="B52-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Its antiproliferative activity on liver, lung, colon, and breast cancer cell lines has also been demonstrated [
 <xref rid="B52-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="B53-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,

 <xref rid="B56-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Yin et al. [
 <xref rid="B56-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] suggested that the induction of apoptosis may be the main mechanism of the cytotoxic activity of carvacrol against HepG2 and metastatic breast cancer cells. Several authors also confirmed that thymol induces apoptosis in HL-60 promyeloid cancer cells and human glioblastoma cells [

 <xref rid="B58-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. As shown below in our study, the antioxidant activity of essential oil is better than that of hydrosol (
 <xref rid="plants-10-01014-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). This may be explained by the concentration differences of the phenolic monoterpenoids carvacrol and thymol in the oil and hydrosol (
 <xref rid="plants-10-01014-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which show strong antioxidant power at lower concentrations, changing to prooxidant at higher concentrations [
 <xref rid="B59-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. However, this could be the reason for the antiproliferative activity of hydrosol, which is rich in these phenolic compounds that could thus cause oxidative stress and consequently inhibit the division of cancer cells.
