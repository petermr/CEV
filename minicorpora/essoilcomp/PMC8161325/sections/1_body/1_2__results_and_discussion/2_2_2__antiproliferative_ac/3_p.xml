<p>The antiproliferative effects of 
 <italic>Hypericum</italic> species around the world have been previously studied in various cancer cell lines using different plant extracts ranging from methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate, dichloromethane or hexanol to single dominant compounds or mixtures of several compounds. Zorzetto et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] showed that polar extracts and essential oils of 
 <italic>H. reflexum, H. canariense</italic> and 
 <italic>H. grandifolium</italic> strongly inhibited the proliferation of human melanoma cell line A375, breast adenocarcinoma cell line MDA-MB 231 and colon cancer cell line, HCT116. They also tested some individual essential oil compounds such as α-pinene, β-pinene, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene and 
 <italic>n</italic>-nonane. The individual compounds showed weaker antiproliferative effect on the tested cancer cells than the essential oil. One possible reason for this effect is that the essential oil contains compounds that act synergistically to stop the growth of cancer cells. Crude methanol extracts of southern Brazilian 
 <italic>Hypericum</italic> species fractionated with solvents of increasing polarity (hexane, chloroform and methanol) showed increasing inhibition of the growth of HT-29 human colon cancer cells and H-460 non-small cell lung cancer as the polarity of the fractions decreased [
 <xref rid="B60-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The hexane fractions were found to be the most effective, probably because they are rich in lipophilic phenols, which have already been shown to be potent inhibitors of in vitro cancer cell proliferation [

 <xref rid="B62-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The flower extract of H. perforatum L. showed significant growth inhibition and induction of cell death in K562 erythroleukemic cells. In contrast to the extract, pure hypericin, which is one of the predominant compounds of the extract, showed weaker cytotoxic effect, leading to the conclusion that other compounds, not only hypericin, inhibit cancer cell growth, individually or synergistically [
 <xref rid="B63-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Gönenç et al. [
 <xref rid="B64-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] showed that ethanol extracts of H. perforatum possess antiproliferative activity against human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), breast cancer cell line (HCC-1937) and osteosarcoma cell line (U2OS). A possible mechanism of the antiproliferative effect of the extracts could involve apoptosis and autophagy. Quassinti et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] also showed that a model of the antiproliferative activity of the essential oil of 
 <italic>H. hircinum</italic> L. subsp. 
 <italic>majus</italic> (Aiton) N. Robson on glioblastoma and melanoma cells could involve autophagy. The authors emphasized the importance of further research to isolate and identify the essential oil compounds responsible for autophagy in these cancer cell lines. Guzey et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] came to a similar conclusion. They confirmed the good antiproliferative activity of several species of the genus 
 <italic>Hypericum</italic>, as well as the apoptotic effect apparently associated with good antioxidant activity. Our results have shown for the first time that, in addition to essential oils and other 
 <italic>Hypericum</italic> extracts, hydrosol of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>veronense</italic> has considerable potential as a possible cytotoxic agent. Further studies on other cell lines are required to assess the feasibility of using hydrosol for pharmacological purposes.
