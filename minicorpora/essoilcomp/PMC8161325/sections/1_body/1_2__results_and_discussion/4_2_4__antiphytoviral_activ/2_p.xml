<p>The inhibition of local symptoms on the third day after inoculation reached a significant value of 88.05% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-01014-f002">Figure 2</xref>). By the fifth day after inoculation, local lesions also developed on the inoculated leaves of the essential oil treated plants, but the percentage of inhibition compared to the control was still high (61.10%); on the seventh day post inoculation, the percentage of inhibition of local lesions on the leaves of the plants treated with essential oil was 50.33% (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-01014-f002">Figure 2</xref>), we can conclude that pretreatment of local host plants with the essential oil of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>veronense</italic> shows a promising activity level, especially in the early stage of infection. Pretreatment with the hydrosol of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>veronense</italic> also reduced the development of local lesions on host plant leaves (
 <xref rid="plants-10-01014-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), although the efficacy was weaker compared to the oil (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-01014-f002">Figure 2</xref>), possibly related to the differences in the qualitative and quantitative composition between them described in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot1-plants-10-01014">Section 2.1</xref>. The delay in the appearance of symptoms was not noticed on the leaves of hydrosol-treated plants compared to the control; local lesions appeared on the third day post inoculation in both groups; nevertheless, the number of local lesions on the leaves of hydrosol-treated plants was significantly reduced compared to the control on the third, fifth and seventh day post inoculation (
 <xref rid="plants-10-01014-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), and the percentages of inhibition of local lesions on hydrosol-treated plants were 50.37, 36.10, and 39.87%, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-01014-f002">Figure 2</xref>). These promising results confirmed our hypothesis about the antiphytoviral activity, not only of the essential oils, but also of the hydrosol of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>veronense</italic>. The reported antiphytoviral activity of both essential oil and hydrosol deserves a more detailed analysis in the future and opens new research areas regarding this unexplored bioactivity of essential oils and hydrosols of 
 <italic>Hypericum</italic> species.
