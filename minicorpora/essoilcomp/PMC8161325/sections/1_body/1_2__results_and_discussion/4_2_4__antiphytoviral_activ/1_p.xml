 <italic>Hypericum</italic> species from around the world are a source of bioactive essential oils. Since ancient times, essential oils have been used in folk medicine not only as fragrances or preservatives for food, but also for very important biological activities (e.g., antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, anti-inflammatory) [
 <xref rid="B69-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. In addition, there is a wealth of information on the role of essential oils in plant-plant, plant-animal, or plant-insect interactions [
 <xref rid="B70-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. We have previously reported that essential oils from different plant species can trigger a response to viral infections in plants [

 <xref rid="B29-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], but the same has never been shown for hydrosols. We hypothesise that hydrosols, as water solutions of bioactive components during the distillation process of essential oil, are a readily available and safe natural source of bioactive components that can serve as a mixture of active ingredients that can protect plants against viral infections. Thus, in addition to the volatile profile and antiphytoviral activity of the essential oil, the aim of this research was to study for the first time the antiphytoviral activity of the hydrosol of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>veronense</italic> and to provide some new data that can lead us towards natural plant protection and the reduction of the use of synthetic agents in the fields. The activity of both the essential oil and hydrosol of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>veronense</italic> on the defence response of local host plants to tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) infection was investigated. Local host plants treated with essential oil prior to virus infection significantly reduced the number of local lesions in the early stages of infection (
 <xref rid="plants-10-01014-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In addition to the reduction in the number of local lesions, a delay in the onset of symptoms was observed in the essential oil treated plants. In the control group, the local lesions appeared on the third day post inoculation, while in the essential oil-treated group, a significant number of inoculated leaves had no symptoms at that time (mean value of local lesions for control and treatment was 6.05 and 0.72, respectively) (
