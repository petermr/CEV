<p>Essential oils of 
 <italic>Corriandrum sativum</italic> L., 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic>, 
 <italic>C. schoenanthus</italic>, 
 <italic>E. staigeriana</italic> and 
 <italic>L. origanoides</italic> were found highly effective against 
 <italic>H. contortus in vitro</italic>. Essential oils may acquire this efficacy owing to a mixture of different chemical constituents whose interaction can result in compounds that inhibit or disorganize vital functions from the initial stages of development onward, interrupt with parasite metabolic activities, and interfere with drive mechanisms due to possible destructuring of the nervous system (
 <xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr">Oka et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, essential oils can alter the permeability and cause depolarization of cytoplasmic membrane by interacting and disrupting the chemical structures of lipids, polysaccharides, and phospholipids (

 <italic>Cocos nucifera</italic> L. revealed the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, phenols, triterpenes, and condensed tannins among others (
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">Lima et al., 2015</xref>). The compounds like flavonoids have antioxidant activities, while condensed tannins have shown antiparasitic activities by binding to proteins present in the cuticle, oral cavity, esophagus, and cloaca, thus inducing chemical and physical damage in the parasite (

The efficacy of plant compounds may be attributed to the fact that they inhibit or retard the growth, maturation damage, suppress appetite or reduce procreative ability, which are all the causes of mortality. Moreover, the considerable activity of plants extracts may be due to the additive or synergistic relationship among different major components which can interact with multiple molecular targets in various developmental stages of the parasite to produce a pharmacological effect (
