 <italic>H. contortus</italic> exposed to 
 <italic>C. citriodora</italic> essential oils demonstrated ultrastructural changes, such as formations of vacuoles, disorganization of muscular layer, and changes in the mitochondrial profile. These changes suggest the loss of homeostasis and loss of motility due to muscular disorganization of the parasite (

 <italic>E. helioscopia</italic> has monoterpens, which are lipophilic and can penetrate through cell membrane, induce expansion, increase permeability and disturb membrane structure and membrane embedded enzymes (

 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Cox et al., 2001</xref>). The nematicidal activity may also be attributed to the presence of tannins, which on the surface of nematodes can form complexes with proteins and result in alteration of metabolic pathways (

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Ahmed, 2010</xref>) and enzymes (cysteine proteinases), which can damage the cuticle and kill the nematode parasites (

 <italic>L. latisiliquum</italic> leaves forage utilization presented ultrastructural changes; for instance, disturbance of intestinal muscular cells/tissues and cytoplasmic vacuolization, suggesting that different secondary metabolites of leaves may provoke these changes. The alterations to the intestinal cells may be due to the ingestion of active compounds by the parasite, and the resulting direct contact between the bioactive compounds and the intestinal cells. The cytoplasmic vacuolization described can be interpreted as signs of disturbances in cellular functions, possibly due to imbalance of fluid exchanges between the intestinal and pseudocoelomic space and/or between the muscle and the pseudocoelomic space (
