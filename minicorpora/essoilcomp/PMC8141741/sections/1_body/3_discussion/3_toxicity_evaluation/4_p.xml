<p>Low toxicity of 
 <italic>A. sativum</italic> and 
 <italic>L. viridiflorum</italic> was observed on human HaCat and mammalian macrophages cells, respectively, (

 <italic>C. citriodora</italic> essential oil and citronellal suggesting toxicity of the plant species (

 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> and 
 <italic>A. herba-alba</italic> lead to neurotoxicity and infertility by affecting the reproductive system, respectively (

 <italic>A. indica</italic> poisoning affect was dose and time dependent and histopathological analysis showed that the testicles, liver, and kidneys were the organs affected (

 <italic>C. procera</italic> latex was found to be toxic at the tested doses, animals developed signs of nervousness, salivation, urination, dyspnea, tachycardia, and loss of condition. Severe pathological changes in intestines, heart, liver, kidneys, lungs, and brain were also observed (
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">Mahmoud et al., 1979</xref>). A slight change (decrease) in the serum biochemical profile was also observed. This decrease in serum zinc, iron, and copper concentration (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Al-Qarawi et al., 2001</xref>) might be due to continue (i) interference of adult parasites in the abomasum with digestibility and absorption of nutritive substances as a results of existing damage to the abomasal mucosa and its digestive function, or (ii) effects of unknown toxic principles elaborated by the worm.
