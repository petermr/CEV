<p>Extensive use of Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Lamiaceae, and Euphorbiaceae, users’ reliability, and antiparasitic activity could be attributed to the presence of potent phytochemicals such as saponins, tannins, flavonoids in Asteraceae (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Carvalho et al., 2013</xref>), saponins, essential oils in Lamiaceae (
 <xref rid="B161" ref-type="bibr">Raja, 2012</xref>), phenolic compounds, alkaloids, and hemagglutinins in Fabaceae (
 <xref rid="B194" ref-type="bibr">Żarnowski et al., 2001</xref>), and alkaloids and terpenoids in Euphorbiaceae (
 <xref rid="B142" ref-type="bibr">Mwine and Van Damme, 2011</xref>). Mechanism of action of these compounds against different developmental stages of 
 <italic>H. contortus</italic> is still unknown, however, probably these may inhibit both egg embryonation and direct effects on the larvae (

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Athanasiadou et al. (2001)</xref> attributed the antiparasitic activity of condensed tannins to their ability to bind with the cellular membrane proteins, which results in the unavailability of nutrients to the larvae, causing starvation, and death (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Athanasiadou et al., 2001</xref>). It seems that complexities of these compounds enable them to interrupt various molecular targets of different developmental stages of the parasite. Saponoids usually act by binding to surface molecules (proteins/sterols) inducing inhibition of the protein expression, and/or lysis of the cell (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Bruneton, 1993</xref>). The expression of surface proteins of nematodes is stage specific (
