<p>Mostly, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have been performed to evaluate the anti-haemonchiasis activity of plants. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have a key role in initial screening however, these studies provide no information of bioavailability, toxicity, and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy of tested extract/compound. Hence, in future 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies by using suitable animal models should be carried out to understand the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the tested extract/compound. Most of the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies provide no evidence about toxicity and mechanism of action of the medicinal plant/compound, this is the most neglected aspect and strongly suggested to researchers to evaluate toxicity levels and pharmacological action of the tested plant/compound.

 <italic>,</italic> and 
 <italic>Foeniculum vulgare</italic> Mill. among others were highly effective 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> against different life stages of the parasite, however, these plant species are not tested for 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy. These plants should be evaluated for 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-haemonchiasis activity along with phytochemical profile, toxicological effects, and pharmacological activity. Most of the reported studies provide no information regarding time exposure and LC
 <sub>50</sub> values of medicinal plant/compound used for 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> evaluation. Time exposure and LC
 <sub>50</sub> are very important parameters to understand the accurate efficacy of medicinal plants, therefore, it is recommended to provide this information in future studies. Plants contain a number of different compounds, which act synergistically to perform an activity, only few compounds have been isolated and tested 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>/
 <italic>in vivo</italic> against 
 <italic>H. contortus</italic>. It is recommended to identify/isolate individual compounds and evaluate their activity
 <italic>,</italic> this will provide more precise and in depth information of anti-haemonchiasis potential of the medicinal plant under observation. Plant compounds cinnamaldehyde, thymol, and carvacrol have revealed high efficacy in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, it is recommended to further investigate these compounds for 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> activity. Carvone and anethole have shown promising anti-haemonchiasis potential 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, however, their toxicity levels and pharmacological effects are unknown and should be investigated in future studies. 
 <italic>L. viridiflorum</italic> has revealed high efficacy both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and has no adverse/toxic effects after oral administration and considered to be safe, it is recommended to pharmaceutical industries to further investigate this plant species because it could be an alternative candidate for drug development against 
 <italic>H. contortus</italic>.
