 <italic>Haemonchus contortus</italic> is the causative agent of haemonchiasis usually known as “twisted barber” pole worm or stomach worm (
 <xref rid="B170" ref-type="bibr">Saminathan et al., 2015</xref>), and a common blood feeder of small ruminants. The parasite is present throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world where it is a major constraint for profitable production of sheep and goats (
 <xref rid="B195" ref-type="bibr">Zenebe et al., 2017</xref>). Haemonchiasis is characterized by severe anemia, leading to a serious impairment of the animal, severe economic losses, and acute disease outbreaks with high death rate particularly in young animals (
