<p>As a result, there is a dire need to develop alternative anthelmintic approaches from natural flora which can be less toxic, biodegradable, environmental friendly, and to cover the most challenging problem of parasite resistance issue (

 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Bucar et al., 2013</xref>). The compounds from plants have also been found to be synergistic enhancers in that though they may not possess any anthelmintic properties alone, but when used concurrently with standard drugs they enhance the activity of the drug. The synergistic effect of the association of an anthelmintic drug and plant extracts against resistant pathogens leads to new choices for the treatment of infectious diseases. Also synergy between bioactive plant product and antiparasitic will confront problems of toxicity and overdose since lesser concentrations of two agents in combination are required, due to these reasons, there is need for continuous exploration of multidrug resistance modulating principles from plants sources (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Aiyegoro and Okoh, 2009</xref>). The herbal medicines however, suffer from lack of standardization parameters. The main limitation is the lack of standardization of raw materials, processing methods and the final products, dosage formulation, and the non-existence of criteria for quality control (
