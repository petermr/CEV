<p>Different solvents including n-hexane, aqueous, ethanolic, hydro-alcoholic, methanolic, and others were used in extracts preparation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Among all, the methanol extract was the predominant one. Bioassays reported in this review included, egg hatching test (EHT), larval development test (LDT), larval motility test (LMT), adult worm motility test (AWMT), adult parasite mortality test (APMT), and larval artificial exsheathment assay (LAEA) in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, while fecal egg count reduction (FECR), egg count per gram of feces (EPG), total warm count reduction (TWC/WCR) in 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies. Furthermore, among the above mentioned assays, EHT was the most widely used assay for evaluation of medicinal plants against 
 <italic>H. contortus</italic>
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, while FECR was common 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Sheep were the commonly used experimental model
