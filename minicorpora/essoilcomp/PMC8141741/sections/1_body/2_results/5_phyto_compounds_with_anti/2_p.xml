<p>Carvacrol and carvacryl acetate at 2 mg/ml showed 100% larval motility inhibition as compared to other compounds. Similarly, carvacryl acetate (0.2 mg/ml) and citronellal (2 mg/ml) totally reduced the motility of adult parasites 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, citronellal was moderately toxic in mice. Anethole and carvone significantly reduced fecal egg count, decreased male length, and reproductive capacity of female at 50 mg/kg concentration
