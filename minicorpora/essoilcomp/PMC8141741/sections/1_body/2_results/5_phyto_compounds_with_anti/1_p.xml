<p>In this review, 19 compounds were reported to be assessed for 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> activity against different life stages of 
 <italic>H. contortus</italic>. While only 3 compounds were found to be evaluated for 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> activity using gerbil (
 <italic>Meriones unguiculatus</italic>) as an animal model. Based on minimum concentration and maximum nematicidal activity, Cinnamaldehyde, anethole, and carvone were highly active and completely inhibited egg hatching of the parasite at the tested concentrations of 0.085, 0.085, and 0.366 mg/ml, respectively. Carvacrol inhibited the larval development at a minimum concentration of 1 mg/ml, though the effectiveness of thymol and anethole against larvae development was also significant, but relatively at high concentrations i.e., 10 and 20 mg/ml, correspondingly.
