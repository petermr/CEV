<p id="p0020">We selected published literature about Iranian medicinal plants with anti-QS properties in the years between 2010 and 2020. Medicinal plants with QQ effects that have grown endemic or non-endemic in a different region of Iran were selected. We considered all of the herbal extracts with phenotypic or molecular QQ effects on the QS system of different bacterial biosensor strains, or bacterial pathogens isolated from clinical specimens in Iran. For this reason, we collected studies that were related to the anti-QS system activity of herbal extracts, for example, anti-biofilm activity. Articles that only provided other effects of Iranian medicine plants such as antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammation and some others were excluded. Also, studies on QQ effects of other agents, such as a different form of vitamins, metal complexes (e.g. copper, iron, curcumin, zinc), many microorganisms (quorum quenchers isolated from bacterial strains) and herbal medicine in other countries, as weel as duplicate documents were excluded.</p>
