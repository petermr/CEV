<p id="p0065">In several types of research on the QQ activity of medicinal plants, researchers have made different suggestions for future QQ studies; for example, improving QQ studies to recognize all medicinal plants with anti-QS properties and evaluation of these studies in both in vitro and in vivo conditions. Additionally, because the effective compounds of some medicinal plants with QQ activity have not been identified, it is essential to identify these bioactive agents to expand and develop the anti-QS research. Many anti-QS examinations were completed on biosensor strains or standard species and it is better to develop this research on different bacterial species isolated from clinical specimens or polymicrobial biofilms. Furthermore, defining minimal QS inhibitory concentration (MQSIC) and the MQSIC: MIC ratio for different herbal extracts would be useful when discussing the respective efficacy of these plant species.</p>
