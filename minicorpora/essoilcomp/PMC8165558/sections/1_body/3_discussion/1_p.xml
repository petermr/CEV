<p id="p0035">Today, an effective treatment system and development of new antibacterial drugs to control bacterial infections are very important, because of the appearance of new resistance genes in many pathogenic bacteria and the spread of antibiotic resistance are increasing. Interfering with the bacterial communication systems and inhibition of signal exchange in microbial populations through QQ activity of medicinal plants can be recommended as a new treatment in microbiology. Following this inhibition, the ability of bacterial species to control and express virulence genes for invasive actions decreases.</p>
