<p id="p0060">Since QS and interfering with these communication systems in bacterial species were introduced as a hot topic in microbiology, many researchers in Iran have been attracted to investigate this field and have studied the anti-QS effects of various Iranian medicinal plants. These medicinal plants with active compounds were used as antioxidant, antimicrobial and antifungal agents to develop new antimicrobial drugs, for the treatment of various diseases, and for the inhibition of pathogenic bacteria with antibiotic resistance [

These medicinal plants have been used for treatment of infectious disease in Iran. Some of these herbal extracts showed anti-QS activity against biosensors, standard and clinical bacterial strains. This result is very important because the QS systems can be considered a new target for the development of new remedial strategies and it is a good opportunity to develop QQ studies to effectively fight bacterial infections in the future.
