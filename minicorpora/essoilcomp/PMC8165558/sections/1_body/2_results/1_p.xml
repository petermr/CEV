<p id="p0030">Based on our results, different studies have been performed on the QQ effects of medicinal plants in Iran. We identified 106 plant species with different effects in medicine, which have been evaluated for anti-QS properties. These medicinal plants were commonly used for different treatment purposes in Iran. Only 35 species of these medicinal plants have shown QQ effects at sub-MICs. These effects are acceptable because at this concentration, the microbial population is stable, bacterial species are alive, and they carry out signal exchange using QS systems. These studies evaluated the QQ activity of herbal extracts on biosensor strains (e.g. 
 <italic>Chromobacterium violaceum</italic> wild type or CV026, Pectobacterium carotovorum, Agrobacterium tumefaciens NTL/PZLR4, 
 <italic>Pseudomona</italic>s aeruginosa PAO1 wild type or PAO1 (MH873), and Aeromonas veronii Sobria strain BC88) or different bacterial species isolated from clinical specimens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, 
 <italic>St</italic>aphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi and Salmonella Typhimurium. These anti-QS effects have been studied phenotypically (e.g. repress violacein production in C. violaceum, prevent biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus, reduce pyocyanin, protease and elastase production in P. aeruginosa) and molecularly such as down-regulation of QS genes (sdiA and luxS in Salmonella Typhimurium, LuxS and pfs in Streptococcus pneumoniae, or lasI and lasR in P. aeruginosa through different methods. For example, real-time PCR method for gene expression assay, microtitre plate assay for anti-biofilm activity, different bacteriological or innovative methods (e.g. use of soft top agar contained Luria–Bertani (LB) agar and semi-solid LB with biosensor strains, melted LB agar with biosensor strains, moulten semi-solid LB agar and signal molecules, and LB soft agar with herbal extracts) for in vitro QQ assay of herbal extracts. Plant materials were obtained from natural areas in different regions of Iran or purchased from reputable companies, for instance Bonyan Salamat Kasra Co. (Tehran, Iran). Herbal medicines were extracted using polar and non-polar solvents (e.g. acetone, methanol, ethanol, n-hexane) or preparing essential oils by different methods (includeing Soxhlet, maceration, digestion and superficial extraction). Some of the studies reported the QQ activity of some herbal extracts at high concentrations and researchers used different solvents to maximally extract polar and dipolar compounds from these medicinal plants instead of using alcohol or water extraction, which just extracts some of the bioactive compounds. It may for this reason that medicinal plants consist of many different compounds. A few studies used different chromatography methods, such as thin-layer and gas chromatography, to identify the bioactive compounds of herbal medicines. In some studies, some of the plant extracts with antibacterial properties showed QQ effects. Researchers have new applications for these herbal extracts with anti-QS properties. For example, treatment of chronic infections caused by bacterial pathogens by permitting the human immune system to eradicate the pathogens, designing the new anti-biofilm agents based on herbal medicine compounds, using these plant compounds as alternatives to antibiotics for control and treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacterial strains, and developing herbal drugs such as mouthwashes against dental bacterial infection.
