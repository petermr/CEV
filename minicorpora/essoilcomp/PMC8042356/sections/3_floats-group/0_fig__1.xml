  <p>Workflow scheme. The work is divided into four main parts: (1) Search of natural compounds present in essential oils from Brazilian native species; (2) QSAR analysis and selection of compounds with high antiviral potential; (3) Molecular docking analysis and selection of top 14 compounds with the highest binding energies values for papain-like protease (PLpro), 3-Chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), spike glycoprotein (S protein), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp); (4) Search of species containing at least one of selected compounds as top 5 constituent in their essential oil</p>
