<p id="Par12">Recently, the outbreak of the Zika virus also raised concerns for the scientific community due to the severe disorders caused by this infection and the absence of an approved drug to combat it. However, essential oils like the one obtained from 
 <italic>Ayapana triplinervis</italic> prove to be a potent phytocompound against this virus (Haddad et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2019</xref>). In addition, it is worth highlighting the great potential of essential oils extracted from 
 <italic>Lippia</italic> genus as an antiviral agent. 
 <italic>Lippia origanoides</italic> has already shown action against yellow fever virus and the same property was demonstrated for 
 <italic>Lippia alba</italic> (GÃ³mez et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2013</xref>; Meneses et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2009</xref>)
 <italic>,</italic> which was also effective against four dengue viruses (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4) (Ocazionez et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2010</xref>). All these results show the broad-spectrum antiviral action of essential oils and, therefore, their potential should be investigated against to COVID-19.
