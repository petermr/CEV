<p id="Par11">Based on the few studies of antiviral activity for licensed species, other Brazilian species that have already shown action against any virus were added to the research in order to increase the search source for compounds with potential activity against the new coronavirus. In the study performed by Garc√≠a et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2003</xref>), different essential oils were screened for virucidal property and 
 <italic>Aloysia gratissima</italic> and 
 <italic>Tessaria absinthioides</italic> showed potent inhibition on junin virus (JUNV) and HSV-1, whereas 
 <italic>Eupatorium patens</italic> was active against HSV-1 and dengue virus type 2 (DEN-2). In this same way, 
 <italic>Heterothalamus alienus</italic> essential oil was also able to inhibit JUNV, HSV-1, and DEN-2 viruses (Duschatzky et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2005</xref>). Inhibitory effect in the early stages of infection by other herpes virus (HSV-2) was also observed after treatment with essential oils from 
 <italic>Hyptis mutabilis</italic> and 
 <italic>Ocimum campechianum</italic> (Brand et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2016</xref>).
