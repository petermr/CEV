<p id="Par10">Regarding antiviral activity, this action was not reported yet for essential oils from these species, but studies indicate the activity of their extracts. The aqueous extract from 
 <italic>Lantana camara</italic> leaves has shown action against white spot syndrome virus in shrimp (Balasubramanian et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2007</xref>). In addition, the aqueous extract from 
 <italic>Mikania glomerata</italic> and 
 <italic>Solanum paniculatum</italic> leaves had antiviral activity against Suid Herpesvirus (SuHV-1) (Kaziyama et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2012</xref>). The hydroethanolic extract from 
 <italic>Schinus terebinthifolia</italic> stem bark also inhibited 
 <italic>Herpes simplex</italic> virus type 1 strains (HSV-1) (Nocchi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2017</xref>). On the other hand, no antiviral action has been reported in the literature for 
 <italic>Cordia curassavica</italic>, 
 <italic>Croton. heliotropiifolius</italic> and
