<p id="Par5">Despite all this diversity and vast use by the population, few species are licensed as pharmaceutical ingredients (Carvalho et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2018</xref>). This occurs because there is little published scientific and ethnopharmacological data, or protocols for quality and safety assurance for native plants (Cavalho et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2018</xref>). Clinical trials involving native Brazilian plants, extracts, essential oils or their active ingredients are even smaller, although there is a solid traditional use by the local population (Carvalho et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2018</xref>; Dutra et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2016</xref>). One of the reasons for the few studies involving native plant species is the strict Brazilian standards for access to biodiversity, and the lack of adequate documentation for the use and regulation of these species (Carvalho et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2018</xref>; Dutra et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2016</xref>). This fact justifies the need for further studies focused on the native Brazilian flora (Carvalho et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2018</xref>; Dutra et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2016</xref>).
