<p id="Par4">Essential oils have important pharmacologic proprieties, such as broad-spectrum antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral action and immunomodulation, in addition to few adverse effects (Raut and Karuppayil

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">2019</xref>). Thus, essential oils show great efficacy and speed of action, and they can represent an important source for the development of COVID-19 treatments. In this way, this study aimed to evaluate the potential of compounds present in essential oils from Brazilian species. Brazil hosts more than 20% of the biodiversity in the world, with more than 46,000 species of plants, algae and fungi that were already identified and cataloged (Dutra et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2016</xref>; Filard et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2018</xref>). These numbers become even more impressive when considering that the knowledge about the countryâ€™s entire biodiversity is incomplete, and researchers are still working on building of this information (Filard et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2018</xref>). Therefore, Brazilian flora has a rich chemical variety that makes it a potential source for drug discovery (Valli and Bolzani
