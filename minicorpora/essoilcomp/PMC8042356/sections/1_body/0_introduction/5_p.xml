<p id="Par6">Several reviews have been published about natural products as possible drugs against SARS-CoV-2. However, in the face of this pandemic for which no specific drug has yet been approved, it is essential to increasingly expand studies in search of effective treatment. Therefore, this review included essential oils from native Brazilian species with previously reported antiviral activity, as well as native species licensed in Brazil found in the herbal medicine market, aiming to involve natural products accessible to the population. These Brazilian species were used as a source of chemical diversity. In addition, in order to deepen this research, other species apart from the native ones were also investigated and indicated in the second stage of this review. An illustrative summary of the methods and results obtained can be found in Fig.Â
