<p id="Par38">In addition, the drug-likeness based on Lipinski’s rule was also predicted, on ADMETlab platform. According to Lipinski’s rule, a molecule should present molecular weight ≤ 500 Dalton, number of H-bond donors ≤ 5, number of H-bond acceptors ≤ 10 and LogP ≤ 5 to be considered as an ideal drug molecule (Lipinski 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2004</xref>). The results indicated that none of 
 <bold>1</bold> to 
 <bold>14</bold> compounds violated the Lipinski’s parameters (except LogP for compound 
 <bold>7</bold>), showing good probability to achieve cell permeability and be considered as a drug candidate (Table S6, Supplementary material).
