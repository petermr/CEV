<p id="Par35">During the new drugs discovery, in addition to the interest targets, it is also important to evaluate the possibly off-targets bindings. Off-target binding comprises the binding of a compound to a protein other than its primary target of therapeutic interest, which can lead to side-effects (Xie et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">2011</xref>). The selected compounds 
 <bold>1</bold>–
 <bold>14</bold> were submitted to SwissTargetPrediction, one of the standard tools of computational off-target prediction methods with 2092 
 <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> targets (Daina et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2019</xref>). The results indicated a low probability (≤ 16%) of affinity with the targets for the compounds, indicating a low potential of off-target competition, except for the compound 
 <bold>2</bold>. This compound showed 33% of probability of interaction with LXR-alpha (Table S5, Supplementary material). The LXR-alpha (nuclear liver X receptor alpha) is involved in the cholesterol metabolism and lipid biosynthesis. In addition, it is a regulator of inflammatory cytokines and suppressor of hepatic glucose production, being a potential drug target for treatment of diabetes (Steffensen and Gustafssonet 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">2004</xref>). However, the anti-diabetes effect of the compound 
 <bold>2</bold> is not yet reported in the literature and its probability of affinity (33%) can be considered low.
