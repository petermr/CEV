<p id="Par36">Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) profile has a great importance in drug discovery and development. Focusing on off-target actions, the selected compounds 
 <bold>1</bold>–
 <bold>14</bold> were evaluated for their possible toxic effects (cardiotoxic, hepatotoxic and mutagenic) through the web-based tool ADMETlab (Dong et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2018</xref>). The inhibition of the hERG potassium channel may result in QT interval prolongation and causes severe cardiac side effects, which is the foremost problem in clinical studies of drug candidates (Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">2012</xref>). Regarding hepatotoxicity, drug-induced liver injury is a major cause for drug withdrawal from the market (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2011</xref>). Ames test, the most widely used assay for testing the mutagenicity (Xu et al. 2012), was used for this parameter prediction. Interestingly, compounds 
 <bold>1–14</bold> were not highly likely for these important toxicity endpoints (except hepatotoxicity for compound 
 <bold>4</bold>), forecasting their security (Table S6, Supplementary material). Several in vivo studies have already demonstrated that many essential oils can be used safely (Altaei

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2015</xref>; Cruz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2017</xref>; Mishra et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2018</xref>). Furthermore, clinical trials have confirmed the good tolerability of essential oils use for humans (Lillehei and Halcon

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2015</xref>; Han et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2017</xref>). Although the compound 
 <bold>4</bold> has presented a prediction for hepatotoxicity, it is one constituent of 
 <italic>Aloysia gratissima</italic> essential oil which did not cause side effects on fish when used as an anesthetic (Benovit et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2015</xref>).
