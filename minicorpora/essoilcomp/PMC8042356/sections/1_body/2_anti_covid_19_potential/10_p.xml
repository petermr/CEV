<p id="Par22">The selected compounds were identified in the essential oils from 
 <italic>Aloysia gratissima</italic>, 
 <italic>Cordia curassiava</italic>, 
 <italic>Lantana camara</italic>, 
 <italic>Lippia alba, Lippia origanoides</italic> and 
 <italic>Schinus terebinthifolia</italic> in the first research step. Among these, the native licensed species 
 <italic>Lantana camara</italic> has the greatest potential in which seven compounds were identified: 
 <bold>3</bold>, 
 <bold>6</bold>, 
 <bold>7</bold>, 
 <bold>8</bold>, 
 <bold>10</bold>, 
 <bold>13</bold> and 
 <bold>14</bold>. In addition, 
 <italic>Lippia alba</italic> (compounds 
 <bold>2</bold>, 
 <bold>3</bold>, 
 <bold>7</bold>, 
 <bold>9</bold>, 
 <bold>11</bold> and 
 <bold>14</bold>) and 
 <italic>Lippia origanoides</italic> (compounds 
 <bold>5</bold>, 
 <bold>10</bold>, 
 <bold>11</bold>, 
 <bold>12</bold>, 
 <bold>13</bold> and 
 <bold>14</bold>) also present great potential, in which six compounds were identified. Therefore, the molecular docking results suggest that these three essential oils would have potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and these natural products may be indicated for future in vitro trial studies.
