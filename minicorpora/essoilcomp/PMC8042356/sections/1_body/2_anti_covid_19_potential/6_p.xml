<p id="Par18">Thus, the previous compounds that showed high potential against at least one of the viruses (rhinovirus or picornavirus) were subjected to molecular docking studies. This analysis was carried out by AutoDock Vina tool using PyRx software in order to understand the interaction between these compounds and the targets proteins to combat the novel coronavirus infection (Dallakyan and Olson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2015</xref>). Crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) PLpro (Protomer PDB ID 6W9C), main protease, also called 3CLpro (PDB ID 6Y2F), S protein (Protomer PDB ID 6VSB) and RdRp (PDB ID 6M71) were obtained from the protein database (PDB). 3D structures of the compounds were obtained by the PubChem database. The files were converted to the appropriate format (*.pdb) using the Biovia Discovery Studio software (San Diego, USA). For which target, a grid box was defined in order to comprise the entire protein. Then, AutoDock Vina algorithm was used to calculate the binding energies between the targets and the compounds in the PyRx docking tool. Drugs that were already indicated by previous studies as potential anti-COVID-19 with the same proteins as molecular targets were included as positive controls: formoterol, disulfiram. nelfinavir, prulifloxacin, hydroxychloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir and favipiravir (Arya et al.
