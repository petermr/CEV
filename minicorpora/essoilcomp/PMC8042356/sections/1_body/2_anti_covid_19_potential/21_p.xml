<p id="Par33">The compound 
 <bold>1</bold> did not show binding energy stronger than the controls, but it bound in the same region than remdesivir. Thus, the compound 
 <bold>1</bold> probably has a mechanism of action similar to the control remdesivir, since it also bounds in the RdRp active site, which can inhibit the virus by synthesis inhibiting of viral nucleic acid (Wu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">2020</xref>). Remdesivir has broad-spectrum activity against members of several virus families (Ebola, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) and showed clinical improvement in 68% of patients with severe COVID-19 in a clinical study (Grein et al.
