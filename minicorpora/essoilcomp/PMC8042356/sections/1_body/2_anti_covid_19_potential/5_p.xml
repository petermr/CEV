<p id="Par17">This strategy was based on non-specific antiviral properties and broad spectrum mechanisms of action of essential oils on viruses that can be related to their complex chemical composition. Morphological alteration is an example of mode of action of these natural products since they can destroy or mask the virus which affects viral attachment and influences its adsorption in the host cells (Ma and Yao 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2020</xref>). However, the viral structure is very simple, being basically composed by genetic material surrounded by a protein wrap (BÃ¶hme et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2013</xref>). In this way, genome-related sites can be a target of essential oils but the protein inhibition is a promising alternative to treat the COVID-19 (Mori et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">2020</xref>). According to Wu et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">2020</xref>), the main therapies are related to inhibition of viral life cycle and inhibition of structural proteins. Based on these data, proteins involved to maturation and infectivity of the virus such as papain-like protease (PLpro) and 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) as well as spike glycoprotein (S protein) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that act in the cell cycle of the virus were selected for next analysis.
