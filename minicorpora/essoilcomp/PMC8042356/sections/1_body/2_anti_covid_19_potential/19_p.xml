<p id="Par31">The enzyme RdRp (also known as nsp12) catalyzes the synthesis of viral RNA and plays a central role in the replication and transcription viral cycle. Thus, RdRp can also be target to SARS-CoV-2 therapy as demonstrated in treatment with remdesivir and favipiravir (Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">2020</xref>; Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020</xref>). The structure of the RdRp contains a polymerase domain (fingers, palm and thumb domains) and a nidovirus-unique N-terminal extension domain (NiRAN). These two domains are connected by an interface domain (Gao et al.
