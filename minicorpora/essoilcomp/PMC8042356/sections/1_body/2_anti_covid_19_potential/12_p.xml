 <bold>12</bold> and 
 <bold>13</bold> are predicted to bind to the N-terminal domain of the S1 subunit, as well as the hydroxychloroquine control. The proposed mechanism of action of the hydroxychloroquine includes the inhibition the entry step of SARS-CoV-2 (Liu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2020</xref>). The binding of this drug with the N-terminal domain, which is conserved among clinical isolates worldwide, inhibits the interaction between S protein and the host cell receptor (ACE-2) (Fantini et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2020</xref>). Thus, bonding of the mentioned compounds to the same region of hydroxychloroquine, could inhibit the interaction with ACE-2 and consequently the entry of the virus into the cell. The binding energy (unnormalized and normalized) and inhibition constant values of these compounds indicate stronger affinity with S protein than the control hydroxychloroquine (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a and Table S4). This drug, worldwide used for the treatment of malaria and rheumatological conditions, showed anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects both in vitro and in vivo and was recommended by several national guidelines for treatment of patients with COVID-19 (such as Belgian, Italian and Chinese guidelines) (Singh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2020</xref>). However, the effectiveness of this drug has not been proven by clinical trials and its serious adverse effects especially on the heart and eyes cause concern (Zou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">2020</xref>). Therefore, most countries no longer recommend this drug for the treatment of COVID-19.
