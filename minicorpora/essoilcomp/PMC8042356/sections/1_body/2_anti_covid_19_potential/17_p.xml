 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">2020</xref>). Similarly, the controls nelfinavir and prulifloxacin, considered the best drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro that could be used for the treatment of COVID-19, do not interact either with the 3CLpro catalytic site residues (Qamar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2020</xref>). They bound between domains II and III, as well as the most of the analyzed compounds (Fig.Â
