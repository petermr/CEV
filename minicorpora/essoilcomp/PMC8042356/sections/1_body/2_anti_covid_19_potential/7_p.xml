<p id="Par19">Dimercaprol and mechlorethamine were chosen as negative control since they are clinically established drugs without antiviral activity (Kadioglu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2020</xref>). With exception of disulfiram, the positive control drugs revealed binding energies ≤ -5.2 kcal/mol and inhibition constant ≤ 153.5 µM, while negative control drugs bound with affinities ≥ -3.3 kcal/mol and inhibition constant ≥ 3798.5 µM to the four targets (Table S3, Supplementary material). Disulfiram has a reactive sulfur group that could bind covalently to cysteine proteases as PLpro and such strong binding is not commonly accounted in docking protocols, which helps to explain such high energy binding (− 3.9 kcal/mol) when compared to others positive control drugs (Lin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2018</xref>). This distinction between positive and negative controls is maintained even when the binding energy values energies are normalized by the number of heavy atoms (N) (Normalized binding energy = binding energy/N
 <sup>1/3</sup>) (Table S4, Supplementary material). This normalization strategy normally is employed as an attempt to mitigate the contribution of the compound size to the energy score as many scoring functions tend to favor compounds with higher molecular weight due to a larger sum of van der Waals atom pairs interactions (Pan et al.
