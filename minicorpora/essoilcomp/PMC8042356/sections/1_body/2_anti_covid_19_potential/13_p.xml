<p id="Par25">Arbidol (umifenivir) is another antiviral drug included in clinical trials that act inhibiting the virus entry. This agent is approved in China and Russia for treating influenza, SARS, and Lassa viruses and showed clinical efficacy superior to lopinavir/ritonavir in treating COVID-19 (Zhu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">2020b</xref>). This drug binds in the S2 subunit and it can effectively block or impede the trimerization of the S protein (Vankadari 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">2020</xref>). The compound 
 <bold>10</bold> bound near to the binding region of arbidol and, therefore, it may present a similar mechanism of action. This compound exhibited better binding energy (unnormalized and normalized) and inhibition constant than arbidol (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a and Table S4). On the other hand, the compound 
 <bold>14</bold> bound to other region of the S2 subunit and despite the low binding energy, there is no evidence in the literature that binding at this site leads to inhibition (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a).
