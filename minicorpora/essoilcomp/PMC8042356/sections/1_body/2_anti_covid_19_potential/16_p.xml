<p id="Par28">Along with PLpro, 3CLpro is essential for processing the polyproteins that are translated from the viral RNA and its inhibitors are unlikely to be toxic, since no human protease with similar cleavage specificity is known (Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">2020</xref>). The protomer of this enzyme is divided in the domains I, II and III (Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">2020</xref>). The compound 
 <bold>13</bold> interacts with one of the amino acid residues of the catalytic site (HIS41, domain I), which might interfere with substrate entering (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c) (Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">2020</xref>). Binding to the 3CLpro active site, this compound may have an mechanism of action similar to ritonavir and liponavir, two anti-HIV drugs, which have been reported to be active against SARS and MERS (Nutho et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2020</xref>).
