<p id="Par27">Although they do not bind to this active site, the analyzed compounds can interfere with the PLpro functions by binding into allosteric sites with a low general inhibition constant (&lt; 92.5 uM) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b), which reinforces the potential of these selected compounds as anti-coronavirus agent. The compounds 
 <bold>2</bold>, 
 <bold>4</bold>, 
 <bold>5</bold>, 
 <bold>7</bold>, 
 <bold>8</bold>, 
 <bold>10, 11</bold> and 
 <bold>12</bold> bound between the Ubl and thumb domains. The compounds 
 <bold>9</bold> and 
 <bold>13</bold> bound only in Ubl (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). The Ubl domain is not required for PLpro catalytic activity, but it is necessary for its interferon (IFN) antagonist activity, which is one viral strategy to disable the host’s innate immune response (Frieman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2009</xref>). Another PLpro function involved in modulating the innate immune response is deubiquitinating. PLpro recognizes and cleaves ubiquitin, a protein that regulates a number of cellular pathways, including many processes associated with combating viral infection (Ratia et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2014</xref>). The region between the palm and fingers domains is important for this ubiquitin recognition (Ratia et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2014</xref>). The compounds 
 <bold>1</bold>, 
 <bold>3</bold>, 
 <bold>6</bold> and 
 <bold>14</bold> mainly bound in this region, as well as the formoterol control (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). Formoterol is a bronchodilator used in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, and it has shown potential to inhibit the viral PLpro activity (Arya et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>). Formoterol may reduce human coronavirus replication by inhibiting receptor expression and/or endosomal function and modulating airway inflammation after infection (Yamaya et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">2020</xref>).
