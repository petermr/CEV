 <bold>1</bold>, 
 <bold>3</bold>, 
 <bold>5</bold>, 
 <bold>6</bold>, 
 <bold>7</bold>, 
 <bold>12</bold> and 
 <bold>13</bold> were predicted to bind in the polymerase domain: 
 <bold>1</bold> is located in the RdRp active site, in the palm domain; 
 <bold>3</bold> and 
 <bold>6</bold> in the interface domain and 
 <bold>5</bold>, 
 <bold>7</bold>, 
 <bold>12</bold> and 
 <bold>13</bold> in the fingers domain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). The binding to this polymerase domain might interfere with the viral RNA synthesis (Velthuis et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">2014</xref>). On the other hand, the compounds 
 <bold>2</bold>, 
 <bold>4</bold>, 
 <bold>8</bold>, 
 <bold>9</bold>, 
 <bold>10, 11</bold> and 
 <bold>14</bold> were predicted to bind to the RdRp NiRAN domain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). This domain is not part of the RdRp catalytic site, but it is essential for the virus due to potential functions that may include nucleic acid ligation, mRNA capping and protein-primed RNA synthesis (Lehmann et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2015</xref>).
