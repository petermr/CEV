<p id="Par15">Human rhinovirus and picornavirus belong to the Picornaviridae family, which are nonenveloped viruses with a positive ssRNA genome (Schrauf et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2009</xref>; Fernández-Miragall et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2009</xref>). Although SARS-CoV-2 is a β-coronavirus and belongs to a different family, Coronaviridae, it has non-segmented positive-sense RNA, as well as previous viruses (Zhu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">2020a</xref>). Thus, these three virus contain the same genome classification, belonging to the same group [( +)ssRNA − Group IV].
