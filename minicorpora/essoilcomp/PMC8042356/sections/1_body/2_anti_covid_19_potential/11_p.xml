<p id="Par23">The proteins analyzed by molecular docking are essential for the SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle (Sanders et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2020</xref>). The S protein is involved in the first step of the viral replication cycle, since it mediates the virus attachment to the surface of respiratory cells, using the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) as an entry receptor (Fantini et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2020</xref>). This transmembrane protein forms homotrimers protruding from the viral surface and each single protomer is made up of two functional subunits S1 and S2 (Walls et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">2020</xref>; Wrapp et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">2020</xref>). S1 is divided into 2 subdomains: N-terminal domain and receptor-binding domain (Wrapp et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">2020</xref>).
