<p id="Par13">Although the antiviral activity of essential oils from native plant species licensed in Brazil has not been tested, they have other pharmacological properties and may have the potential to treat SARS-CoV-2, as indicated by other drug repositioning studies. In addition to drug repositioning, other alternatives can accelerate the research for COVID-19 treatments. The virtual screening (in silico) is an important tool to guide both in vitro and in vivo research, minimizing the assays cost, improving chances of finding the desired drug candidates and generating results in a shorter time (Pinzi and Rastelli 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2019</xref>). In this way, the compounds reported in essential oils from these species were subjected to quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) analysis using the program Prediction of Activity Spectra for Substances (PASS online). The aim of this test was to predict the antiviral potential of these compounds. Their structure was compared with substances that are active against viruses and are available in the database. The action specifically on rhinovirus and picornavirus was selected due the fact of that these two species belong to the same Coronavirus group [( +)ssRNA − Group IV] (Fernández-Miragall et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">c</xref>). The probabilities of each compound to be active (Pa) and inactive (Pi) were reported and the compounds with Pa–Pi ≥ 0.5 were classified as high potential (Seibert et al.
