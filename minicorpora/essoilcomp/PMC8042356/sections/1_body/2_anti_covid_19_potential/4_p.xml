<p id="Par16">In addition, phylogenetic analysis has demonstrated that viruses belonging to Picornaviridae and Coronaviridae families can be classified into the picornavirus-like supercluster and a same compound may have therapeutic potential targeted to multiple viruses in this supercluster (Kim et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2012</xref>). Furthermore, there are studies suggesting that results can be extrapolated between different viruses. Muller et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2018</xref>) found that the natural compound silvestrol, a flavagline isolated from plants of the genus 
 <italic>Aglaia</italic>, presents antiviral activity against coronavirus and picornavirus. The target of silvestrol is the eIF4A helicase required to unwind stable RNA secondary structures in 5â€² UTRs of capped mRNAs to create a binding platform to initiate protein synthesis (Chu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2016</xref>; Hinnebusch et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2016</xref>). Silvestrol increase the affinity of eIF4A to RNA impairing the activity of the eIF4F complex (Sadlish et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2013</xref>). This translation mechanism occurs in coronavirus, such as MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E and this fact justifies Muller et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2018</xref>) findings. However, the authors also found silvestrol activity in picornavirus (human rhinovirus A1 and poliovirus type 1). It is known that picornavirus, although utilizing a different mechanism for viral translation (IRES-dependent mechanism), still require eIF4A helicase activity for efficient translation initiation (Bordeleau et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2006</xref>). Kuo et al (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2009</xref>) also presented molecules that act in both groups of viruses. Those molecules act inhibiting the proteases 3Cpro and 3CLpro in picornavirus (CVB3, EV71 and RV14) and coronavirus (SARS-CoV and CoV-229E), respectively. Therefore, the potential action against rhinovirus and picornavirus were selected to perform the compound screening effective to SARS-CoV-2, since there are few studies on the new coronavirus, which would make the QSAR analysis unfeasible.
