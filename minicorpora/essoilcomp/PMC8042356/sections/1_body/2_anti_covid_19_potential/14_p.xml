<p id="Par26">In addition to S protein, PLpro and 3CLpro are enzymes also considered as promising targets, since they are cysteine proteases which mediate the proteolytic processing of maturation and infectivity of the virus (Arya et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>; Qamar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2020</xref>). The PLpro monomer consists of four domains: palm, thumb, and finger domains which form an extended right-hand architecture, and the N-terminal ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain (Ratia et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2006</xref>). The PLpro active site is located at the bottom of the palm and thumb domains, where the control disulfiram bound (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). Disulfiram, an approved drug to treat alcohol dependence considered a therapeutic option for COVID-19, acts forming a covalent adduct at the active site of SARS-CoV PLpro, thus it is a competitive inhibitor (Lin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2018</xref>; Li and Clercq 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2020</xref>). None of the analyzed compounds indicated the same mechanism of action than disulfiram, since they did not bind to the PLpro active site.
