 <bold>5</bold>, 
 <bold>7</bold>, 
 <bold>12</bold> and 
 <bold>13</bold> exhibited binding energy (unnormalized and normalized) and inhibition constant values lower than favipiravir and they bound near to the binding region of this control, suggesting a similar mechanism of action (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). Favipiravir (T-705), a guanine analogue approved for influenza treatment, can effectively inhibit the viral RdRp and an in vitro study reported its activity against SARS-CoV-2 (Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">2020</xref>; Li and Clercq 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2020</xref>). One clinical trial already reported that among patients with COVID-19, favipiravir significantly improved the latency for relief of pyrexia and cough when compared to arbidol (Chen et al.
