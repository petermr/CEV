<p id="Par20">The 14 compounds that showed the best results for the four analyzed targets were: (
 <italic>E</italic>)-α-atlantone (
 <bold>1</bold>); 14-hydroxy-α-muurolene (
 <bold>2</bold>); allo-aromadendrene epoxide (
 <bold>3</bold>); amorpha-4,9-dien-2-ol (
 <bold>4</bold>); aristolochene (
 <bold>5</bold>); azulenol (
 <bold>6</bold>); germacrene A (
 <bold>7</bold>); guaia-6,9-diene (
 <bold>8</bold>); hedycaryol (
 <bold>9</bold>); humulene epoxide II (
 <bold>10</bold>); α-amorphene (
 <bold>11</bold>); α-cadinene (
 <bold>12</bold>); α-calacorene (
 <bold>13</bold>) and α-muurolene (
 <bold>14</bold>) (Table S3, Supplementary material) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). All these compounds exhibited lower binding energy values (stronger affinity) than the negative controls, even after normalization as these controls have relatively low molecular weight (Table S4, Supplementary material). When compared to the positive controls, in general, the selected compounds showed favorable binding energies, even having lower molecular weight than these reference drugs which makes them more druglike (Table S4, Supplementary material).
