<p id="Par30">In relation to the mechanisms of action of these positive controls, experiments demonstrated that nelfinavir, a very safe and widely prescribed drug in the treatment of HIV-infected patients, exerts its effect not at the entry step, but at the post-entry step of SARS-CoV infection, involving partial 3CLpro block (Yamamoto et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">2004</xref>). The nelfinavir effectiveness in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro was higher than nine HIV-1 protease inhibitors including lopinavir (Yamamoto et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">2020</xref>). Similar to nelfinavir, prulifloxacin also inhibits the 3CLpro SARS-CoV-2 interrupting the dimer formation (Li et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2020</xref>). The compounds 
 <bold>1</bold>, 
 <bold>3</bold>, 
 <bold>6</bold>, 
 <bold>7</bold>, 
 <bold>8</bold>, 
 <bold>9</bold>, 
 <bold>10</bold>, 
 <bold>12</bold> and 
 <bold>14</bold>, probably have the same mechanism of action than nelfinavir and prulifloxacin, since they bound to the same region. None of the analyzed compounds showed binding energy and inhibition constant values lower than these positive controls (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). However, after binding energy normalization, compounds 
 <bold>2</bold>, 
 <bold>4</bold>, 
 <bold>5</bold>, 
 <bold>6</bold>, 
 <bold>7</bold>, 
 <bold>11</bold>, 
 <bold>12</bold>, 
 <bold>13</bold> showed to be more promising than these reference drugs, because their normalized binding energy overcome it due to their lower molecular weight (Table S4, Supplementary material).
