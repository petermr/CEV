<p id="Par39">All considered, the in silico results point out to the potential of the compounds 
 <bold>1</bold>â€“
 <bold>14</bold> to be explored as anti-coronavirus agent. Essential oils are complex mixtures and this chemical diversity guarantees their different therapeutic properties. However, the major compounds, usually consisted by one to five substances, are mainly responsible for their biological effects (Bakkali et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2008</xref>). Based on this prediction, the second research step was based in the selection of essential oils that presented at least one of these compounds as major (at the top five) constituents in order to indicate possible natural products for future in vitro and in vivo trials against COVID-19.
