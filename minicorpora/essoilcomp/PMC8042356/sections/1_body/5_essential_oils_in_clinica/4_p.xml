<p id="Par47">All these data indicate some benefit of essential oil for the treatment of virus infections; however, studies relating to this purpose (essential oils and clinical trials) still represent a small portion among the approach of new viral agents. The results presented in this work reinforce the antiviral potential of compounds found in essential oils and direct the species reported in the Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for in vitro and in vivo assays. On the other hand, the low performance and the difficulty of isolating these components justify the use of essential oils instead of just one active compound. In addition, the complex chemical composition of essential oils allows the occurrence of a synergistic effect between their components and, consequently, greater action against viruses, as well as decreases the probability of developing resistant strains (Schnitzler
