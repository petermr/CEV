<p id="Par46">In a controlled clinical trial to evaluate the reducing of HSV-1 virus (
 <italic>Herpes simplex</italic> virus, Type 1) found in saliva, infected patients were treated with a commercially available mouth rinse or sterile water as control group. The antiseptic was composed of eucalyptol, thymol, and menthol terpenes, which are found in different essential oils. The samples were analyzed at different times (30 s, 30 min and 60 min) after the treatments and it was possible to observe that the group containing terpenes was efficient at the first time, since viruses were not detected after 30 s, whereas for the group containing only water, the virus concentration was not changed (Meiller et al.

 <italic>Melaleuca alternifolia</italic> essential oil has also shown activity against HSV and a randomized, placebo-controlled, investigator-blinded study was performed to evaluate its efficacy. The results showed that patients treated with oil gel (6% tea tree essential oil) have median time to re-epithelialization and median duration of culture positivity (9 days and 3 days, respectively) lower than placebo group (12.5 days and 4 days, respectively) (Carson et al.
