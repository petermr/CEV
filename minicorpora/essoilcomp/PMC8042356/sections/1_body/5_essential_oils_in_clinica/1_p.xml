<p id="Par44">Essential oils have been shown to be effective in clinical trials against respiratory virus infections. A double blind randomized controlled trial using essential oils from different species (
 <italic>Coridothymus capitatus</italic>, 
 <italic>Origanum dictammus</italic> and 
 <italic>Salvia fruticos</italic>a) to treat upper respiratory tract infection was performed by Duijker et al. (

Among the virus-positive patients, human rhinovirus, H1N1 influenza, human metapneumovirus and human coronavirus strains were identified by specific RT-qPCR. The severity and duration of symptoms of these patients were lower in the treated group compared to placebo group and the use of the essential oils was safe, since hepatic or renal function showed no changes. In this same way, randomized study performed by Shayeganmehr et al. (
