<p id="Par50">Another important point is that the essential oils production is affected by several biotic and abiotic factors, and the qualitative and quantitative constitution of these metabolites can be altered in the same species, changed its biological effect (Gobbo-Neto and Lopes 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2007</xref>). In this same way, many essential oils exist in the form of several different chemotypes and for that it is important to ensure the correct identification of the natural product. Thus, we suggest that essential oils should be chemically characterized before screening biological studies to confirm the presence of the compounds indicated (

 <bold>14</bold>) in our research. In addition, we also believe that this work can be used as a reference in the research and evaluation of other oils that have not been identified in the PubMed literature or that have not yet been reported.
