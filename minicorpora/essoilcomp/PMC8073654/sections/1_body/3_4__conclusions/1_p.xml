<p>This review presented a comprehensive report of the phytochemicals and bioactivities of 
 <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic>. As traditional uses, the rhizomes of this plant have been widely used in different countries in Southeast Asia for the treatment of inflammation, pain, rheumatic arthritis, asthma, and skin trouble. Since 1970s, many studies on the phytochemicals and bioactivity of 
 <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic> have been conducted in order to establish the scientific fundamental facts and evidence of such traditional medicinal uses. Phenylbutenoids and curcuminoids have been mainly isolated from 
 <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic> as a single compound, and its essential oil containing monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, and phenylbutenoids has been assessed primarily for its pharmacological and cosmeceutical use. The extracts, solvent fractions, and constituents of this plant have been discovered to have multiple bioactivities, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory (including joint and respiratory inflammation), anticancer, neuroprotective/neurotrophic, and dermatological properties. Therefore, we hope that this review will help to establish experimental design by providing the scientific information for future research and to discover more new medicinal values of 
 <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic>.
