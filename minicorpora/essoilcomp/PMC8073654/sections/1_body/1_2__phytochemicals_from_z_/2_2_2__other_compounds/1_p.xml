<p>Curcumin (
 <bold>42</bold>) is a major compound that was isolated from the rhizomes of 
 <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic> with a yield of more than 0.2% by weight [

 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The related congeners, cassumunins A‒C (
 <bold>43</bold>‒
 <bold>45</bold>), were isolated from this plant by Masuda et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Other curcumins, (1
 <italic>E</italic>,4
 <italic>E</italic>,6
 <italic>E</italic>)-1,7-Bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1,4,6-heptatrien-3-one (
 <bold>46</bold>) and bisdeoxycurcumin (
 <bold>47</bold>), were found in the rhizomes of 
 <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic> [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In addition, two new curcuminoids, neocassumunarin A (
 <bold>48</bold>) and neocassumunarin B (
 <bold>49</bold>), were found in Indonesian ginger, Bangle (
 <italic>Z. purpureum</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Two quinones were found in the rhizomes of 
 <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic> and were identified as 2-methoxy-8(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-1,4-naphthoquinone (cassumunaquinone 1, 
 <bold>48</bold>) and 2-methoxy-8(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-1,4-naphthoquinone (cassumunaquinone 2, 
 <bold>49</bold>) [

 <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic>, such as vanillic acid (
 <bold>50</bold>); 3,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde (
 <bold>51</bold>); 2,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde (
 <bold>52</bold>); and 1-feruloyloxy cinnamic acid (

 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and β-sesquiphellandrene (
 <bold>55</bold>) [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] were isolated from the rhizomes of 
 <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic>, and the essential oil extracted from the leaves of 
 <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic> has been reported to contain 1(10),4-furanodien-6-one (
 <bold>56</bold>); curzerenone (
 <bold>57</bold>); and β-sesquiphellandrene [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Pharmaceutical or cosmeceutical products using essential oil from the rhizomes of 
 <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic> have been developed; thus, the chemical composition of essential oil has been analyzed using usually gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Monoterpenoids, sabinene (
 <bold>58</bold>), and terpinene-4-ol (
 <bold>59</bold>) were identified as major constituents [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] in rhizome essential oil, and α-terpinene (
 <bold>60</bold>), and γ-terpinene (
 <bold>61</bold>) were also discovered [

 <xref rid="B40-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In addition to these components, the essential oil produced by steam contained approximately 25% phenylbutenoids, and oil extracted with light petroleum contained approximately 46% phenylbutenoids [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. These compounds are presented in
