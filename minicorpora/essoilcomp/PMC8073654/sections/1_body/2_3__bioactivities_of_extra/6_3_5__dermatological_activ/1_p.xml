<p>In our previous study on 
 <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic>, one of its constituents, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-1-ol (
 <bold>2</bold>), was discovered to enhance melanogenesis through increasing upstream stimulating factor-1-mediated expressions of ERK, p38, and tyrosinase in the mouse melanoma B16 F10 cell line and to induce hyperpigmentation in brown guinea pigs in vivo [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In another study that aimed to identify the cosmetic potential of this plant [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], its rhizome extracts and components were evaluated for their DPPH radical scavenging, HDFa collagen secretion promotion, tyrosinase inhibition, and inhibition of LPS-induced NO production in RAW264.7 cells. The ethyl acetate extract showed greater activities in this four-assay system compared to those of the petroleum ether and chloroform extracts of the plant. Among the six constituents of the plant, the HDFa collagen secretion promoting activity of 
 <italic>cis</italic>-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-[(
 <italic>E</italic>)-2,4,5-trimehoxystyryl]cyclohex-1-ene (
 <bold>5</bold>) and (1
 <italic>E</italic>,4
 <italic>E</italic>,6
 <italic>E</italic>)-1,7-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1,4,6-heptatrien-3-one (
 <bold>46</bold>), the tyrosinase inhibiting activity of 
 <bold>46</bold>, and the NO production inhibiting activities of 1-feruloyloxycinnamic acid (
 <bold>53</bold>) and bisdemethoxycurcumin (
 <bold>47</bold>) were found. Therefore, the 
 <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic> extract or its constituents have potential applications in the develop natural cosmetic and pharmaceutical products for preventing/treating hypopigmentation, skin aging, or dermatitis.
