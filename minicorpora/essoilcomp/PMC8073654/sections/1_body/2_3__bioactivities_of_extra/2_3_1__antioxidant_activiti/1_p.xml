<p>It was discovered that curcuminoids isolated from 
 <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic>, cassumunin A (
 <bold>43</bold>), and cassumunin B (
 <bold>44</bold>), prevent the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced decrease in cell viability of thymocytes and protect living cells that are suffering from H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The essential oil from 
 <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic> contains three major components, sabinene, terpinen-4-ol, and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-1-(3,4-dimethyoxyphenyl)but-1,3-diene, which exhibited antioxidant activity upon scavenging the 2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) cation radical and demonstrated H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> scavenging activity when emissions of dichlorodihydrofluorescein-fluorescence were reduced within a monocyte cell line (U937) [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In a study on the evaluation of solvent fractions of 
 <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic> on in vitro antioxidant and α-glucosidase inhibitory assay [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], the chloroform fraction showed 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 78.19 μg/mL, while the hexane fraction demonstrated H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> scavenging activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 34.40 μg/mL and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 61.02 μg/mL. The ethanol extract of the 
 <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic> rhizome with 7% curcumin content was evaluated for its effect on superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme activity in rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD), which resulted in increased SOD activity upon oral administration of the extract (400 mg/kg, o.p.) in rats fed an HFD, compared to the control group and HFD group, which indicated that the 
 <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic> rhizome has antioxidant activity and an ameliorate reactive oxygen species effect caused by HFD [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Therefore, in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that curcuminoids and essential oil from 
 <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic> have strong antioxidant activities.
