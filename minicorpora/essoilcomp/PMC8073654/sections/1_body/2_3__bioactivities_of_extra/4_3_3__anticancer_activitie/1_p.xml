<p>Our research group has long carried out a series of studies on the anticancer activities of various components of

 <xref rid="B47-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The chloroform-soluble fraction of 
 <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic> was found to have cytotoxicity against two human cancer cell lines (A549, lung; SNU-638, stomach) with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 18.5 and 11.3 µg/mL, respectively [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Bioassay-guided fractionation of this fraction led to the isolation of several phenylbutenoids, and the cytotoxicities of these compounds have been evaluated against several human cancer cell lines (A549, lung; Col2, colon; SNU-638, stomach; HT-1080, fibrosarcoma) [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Compounds 
 <italic>trans</italic>-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-[(E)-3,4-dimethoxystyryl]cyclohex-1-ene (
 <bold>11</bold>) and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-3-(4′-hydroxy-3′-methoxyphenyl)-4-[(
 <italic>E</italic>)-3′′′,4′′′-dimethoxystyryl]cyclohex-1-ene (
 <bold>18</bold>) exhibited moderate cytotoxicity against all tested human cancer cell lines, whereas (
 <italic>E</italic>)-1-(3′,4′-dimethoxyphenyl)but-1,3-diene (
 <bold>1</bold>) showed significant cytotoxicity against HT-1080 cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 7.9 µM) in a selective manner. In a further mechanism study on the antiproliferative effect of 
 <bold>2</bold> in A549 cells [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], 
 <italic>trans</italic>-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-[(E)-3,4-dimethoxystyryl]cyclohex-1-ene (
 <bold>11</bold>) induced G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest by downregulating the expression of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and cyclins and by suppressing CDK activity via the induction of p21 expression. In addition, our research group has screened the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitory activities of four solvent fractions (hexanes, chloroform, 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol, and aqueous) of Indonesian medicinal plants in P-gp overexpressing multidrug resistance (MDR) cancer cell lines (MES-SA/DX5, uterine; MCF-7/ADR, breast) [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The hexane fraction of 
 <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic> exhibited potent P-gp inhibitory activity with a daunomycin (DNM) IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.93 μg/mL in the MES-SA/DX5 cell line, compared with that of verapamil, which is a well-known P-gp inhibitor (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 1.4 μM) [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and the chloroform fraction decreased the cytotoxicity of DNM with up to a 6.56 μg/mL IC
 <sub>50</sub> value in the MCF-7/ADR cell line (verapamil, IC
 <sub>50</sub> 6.62 μM) [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In our follow-up study on the P-gp inhibitory effect of the constituent of 
 <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic> [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], 
 <italic>trans</italic>-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-[(
 <italic>E</italic>)-3,4-dimethoxystyryl]cyclohex-1-ene (
 <bold>11</bold>) exhibited potent P-gp inhibitory activity when the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of DNM was decreased by more than that of verapamil. Particularly, 
 <bold>11</bold> showed greater enhancement of [
 <sup>3</sup>H]-DNM accumulation and the attenuation of the [
 <sup>3</sup>H]-DNM efflux compared to those of verapamil. (
 <italic>E</italic>)-1-(3′,4′-dimethoxyphenyl)but-1,3-diene (
 <bold>1</bold>) and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-4-(2′,4′,5′-trimethoxyphenyl)but-1,3-diene (
 <bold>14</bold>), having two double bonds in the butane chain, significantly decreased the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of DNM, while (
 <italic>E</italic>)-4-(3′,4′-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-1-ol (
 <bold>2</bold>) and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-4-(3′,4′-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-enyl acetate (
 <bold>3</bold>) with one double bond in their structures showed a weak decrease of those. Compound 
 <bold>11</bold> was discovered to be a potent modulator of P-gp activity but was isolated as a racemic mixture. However, since the pharmacological effects and pharmacokinetic properties of the racemic mixture could be different from those of the respective enantiomers, 3
 <italic>S</italic>-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4
 <italic>R</italic>-[(
 <italic>E</italic>)-3,4-dimethoxystyryl]cyclohex-1-ene (
 <bold>21</bold>) and 3
 <italic>R</italic>-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4
 <italic>S</italic>-[(
 <italic>E</italic>)-3,4-dimethoxystyryl]cyclohex-1-ene (
 <bold>22</bold>), which were optically and actively synthesized by our research group, were evaluated for their P-gp inhibitory effects in the MCF-7/ADR cell line, in which they exhibited DNM cytotoxicities with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 1.44 μM and 3.19 μM [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Then, we identified their mechanism of action by measuring the cellular accumulation and efflux of DNM, human P-gp membrane ATPase activity, and cellular P-gp expression [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Compound 
 <bold>22</bold> significantly changed the ratio of [
 <sup>3</sup>H]-DNM accumulation (539%) and efflux (55.4%), compared to those of 
 <bold>21</bold>; thus, the in vivo application of 
 <bold>22</bold> coadministrated with paclitaxel (a P-gp specific substrate) was investigated. When paclitaxel (25 mg/kg) was orally administered with 2 (5 mg/kg), its relative bioavailability was improved by 185% due to the oral exposure of paclitaxel through the inhibition of the intestinal P-gp. In our recent study, which aimed to discover an inhibitor of metastasis from phenylbutenoid and its derivatives [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], it was discovered that 
 <italic>trans</italic>-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-[(
 <italic>E</italic>)-3,4-dimethoxystyryl]cyclohex-1-ene (
 <bold>11</bold>) activated the nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) activity of recombinant Nm23-H1 (a tumor metastasis suppressor) in a dose-dependent manner (EC
 <sub>50</sub>, 10.7 μM). Compound 
 <bold>11</bold> was shown to bind to the C-terminal of Nm23-H1 and to induce NDPK activation through allosteric conformational changes via an in silico molecular docking analysis. This compound induced morphological changes in a highly invasive breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cell line and reduced Rac1 activation via NDPK activation of Nm23-H1. This compound also suppressed the in vitro invasion and migration of MDA-MB-231 cells and in vivo metastasis in a breast cancer mouse model (a luciferase-expressing metastatic human breast cancer cell (MDA-MB-231-Luc-D3H2LN) implanted in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immune-deficient (NOD/SCID) mice). Matsuda et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] elucidated the inhibitory effects of several phenylbutenoids from 
 <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic> on the invasion of human fibrosarcoma HT-1080 cells. Plain I (
 <bold>25</bold>); plain III (
 <bold>27</bold>); (
 <italic>E</italic>)-1-(3′,4′-dimethoxyphenyl)but-1,3-diene (
 <bold>1</bold>); (
 <italic>E</italic>)-4-(2′,4′,5′-trimethoxyphenyl)but-1,3-diene (
 <bold>14</bold>); and β-sesquiphellandrene (
 <bold>55</bold>) have shown anti-invasive activities with the inhibition of 40.5%, 33.0%, 46.8%, 45.5%, and 29.0% at 30 μg/mL, respectively, compared with the positive control, deguelin with the inhibition of 57.9% at the same concentration. Among them, compound 
 <bold>14</bold> significantly inhibited the invasion of HT-1080 cells, which was determined by very weak cytotoxicity. There was a study on the mechanisms of apoptosis induced by an abundant phenylbutenoid dimer in 
 <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic>, 
 <italic>cis</italic>-3-(3′,4′-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-[(
 <italic>E</italic>)-3′’’,4′’’-dimethoxystyryl]cyclohex-1-ene (
 <bold>4</bold>), toward the T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia CEMss cell line [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. This compound exerted potent antiproliferative activity toward CEMss cells with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 7.11 μg/mL, followed by hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), human breast carcinoma (MDA-MB-231), cervical carcinoma (HeLa), and human blood mononuclear cells with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 17.65, 21.28, 32.38, &gt;50, and &gt;50 μg/mL, respectively. The effect of 
 <bold>4</bold> on the morphology of CEMss cells exhibited significant morphological changes corresponding to typical apoptosis. Compound 
 <bold>4</bold> also showed a significant S phase arrest and triggered the formation of DNA fragmentation in CEMss cells. A decline in the MMP of CEMss cells by 
 <bold>4</bold> was detected. After screening several proteins implicated in apoptosis induction, it was determined that 
 <bold>4</bold> upregulated the Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), caspase-3, cytochrome c, and the second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase and downregulated B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), heat shock protein 70, and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein but did not affect caspase-8, p53, and the BH3 interacting domain death agonist. The activity of caspases-3/7 and -9 involved in the intrinsic pathway was increased in CEMss cells treated with 
 <bold>4</bold>. Thus, 
 <bold>4</bold> exhibited an apoptogenic property in the CEMss cell line via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis induction. Previous results demonstrated that phenylbutenoids from 
 <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic> possess potent anticancer activities via their preventive efficacy on MDR in chemotherapy, as well as the effects of treating cancer caused by multiple carcinogeneses, such as antiproliferative, antimetastatic, and anti-apoptotic activities in cancer.
