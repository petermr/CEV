These two compounds inhibited the release of sulfated glycosaminoglycans and hyaluronic acid induced by Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and suppressed IL-1β-induced loss of collagen and uronic acid contents from cartilage explants. The activities of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-13 induced by IL-1β were reduced by 5 and 7. In a later study by Chaiwongsa et al. [
