<p>The anti-inflammatory activities of the extracts and constituents of 
 <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic> were investigated in carrageenin-induced edema in rats and acetic acid-induced vascular permeability and writhing symptoms in mice [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Oral administration of methanol extract (3 g/kg) exhibited anti-inflammatory activity against edema and reduced the number of writhes induced by acetic acid. Oral administration of methanol extract (1 g/kg), ether-soluble fraction (1.3 g/kg), 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane-soluble fraction (0.2 g/kg), and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-1-(3′,4′-dimethoxyphenyl)but-1-ene (
 <bold>8</bold>) (0.016 g/kg) impacted vascular permeability induced by acetic acid in mice. In an assessment of the topical anti-inflammatory activities of the essential oil of 
 <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic> rhizomes and its major components [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], a topical application of the essential oil inhibited the development of edema induced by carrageenan with an ID
 <sub>50</sub> value of 22 mg/paw, and an ID
 <sub>50</sub> value of (
 <italic>E</italic>)-1-(3′,4′-dimethoxyphenyl)but-1-ene (
 <bold>8</bold>) was estimated to be 3 mg/paw (diclofenac, ID
 <sub>50</sub> 6 mg/paw). Terpine-4-ol (
 <bold>59</bold>) and α-terpinene (
 <bold>60</bold>) showed approximately 40% and 30% inhibition at the highest dose tested (6 mg/paw), respectively. Other tested compounds, sabinene (
 <bold>58</bold>) and γ-terpinene (
 <bold>61</bold>), were inactive. In addition, the hexane fraction of 
 <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic> removing the essential oil was tested in the model of 12-
 <italic>O</italic>-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate(TPA)-induced ear edema in rats and showed an effect with an ID
 <sub>50</sub> value of 854 μg/ear [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The isolates, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-4-(3′,4′-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-1-ol (
 <bold>2</bold>), (
 <italic>E</italic>)-4-(3′,4′-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-enyl acetate (
 <bold>3</bold>); 
 <italic>cis</italic>-3-(3′,4′-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-[(
 <italic>E</italic>)-3′′′,4′′′-dimethoxystyryl]cyclohex-1-ene (
 <bold>4</bold>); 
 <italic>cis</italic>-3-(3′,4′-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-[(
 <italic>E</italic>)-2′′′,4′′′,5′′′-trimethoxystyryl]cyclohex-1-ene (
 <bold>5</bold>); and 
 <italic>cis</italic>-3-(2′,4′,5′-trimethoxyphenyl)-4-[(
 <italic>E</italic>)-2′′′,4′′′,5′′′- trimethoxystyryl]cyclohex-1-ene (
 <bold>6</bold>) from this fraction exerted topical anti-inflammatory activities with ID
 <sub>50</sub> values of 47, 62, 21, 20, and 2 μg/ear, respectively (diclofenac, ID
 <sub>50</sub> 61 μg/ear). Further investigation of the anti-inflammatory activity of (
 <italic>E</italic>)-1-(3′,4′-dimethoxyphenyl)but-1,3-diene (
 <bold>1</bold>) using the in vivo and in vitro model suggested the effect of this compound on cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase pathways [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. This compound inhibited the rat ear edema induced by ethyl phenylpropiolate (EPP), arachidonic acid (AA), and TPA with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 21, 60, and 660 nmol/ear. The rat paw edema induced by carrageenan was also inhibited by 
 <bold>1</bold> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> at 3 h of 22 μmol/paw. Compound 
 <bold>1</bold> inhibited the platelet aggregation induced by collagen, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), AA, and the platelet-activating factor (PAF) with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.35, 4.85, 0.94, and 1.14 mM. The anti-inflammatory activity of (
 <italic>E</italic>)-1-(3′,4′-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-2-ol (
 <bold>17</bold>) has been investigated in several in vivo models [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Compound 
 <bold>17</bold> reduced carrageenin-induced paw edema in rats by 83.9% at a dose of 300 mg/kg. In a test of the effect of 
 <bold>17</bold> on carrageenin-induced rat pleurisy, 
 <bold>17</bold> showed inhibitory activities against the formation of pleural exudate (52.3%) in the accumulation of leukocytes in the pleural exudate (56.5%), and in prostaglandin E
 <sub>2</sub>-like substances that were present in the inflamed exudate (48.8%). Compound 
 <bold>17</bold> exhibited slight inhibitory effects on adjuvant-induced arthritis in primary (15.8%) and secondary lesions (injected [14.5%] and no injected paws [20.0%]). The analgesic properties of 
 <bold>17</bold> were tested using an acetic acid-induced writhing response in mice and tail-flick test in rats, which exerted inhibitory activities on the writhing response and tail-flick response to radiant heat, with inhibitions of 52.0% and 11.7% at a dosage of 300 mg/kg (i.g.). Compound 
 <bold>17</bold> showed an antipyretic effect by reducing the rectal temperature at a low dose of 75 mg/kg (i.g.) in yeast-induced hyperthermia in rats. In our previous study on the anti-inflammatory effects of phenylbutenoids from 
 <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic> [

 <bold>1</bold>) demonstrated inhibitory activities with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 2.71, 3.64, 14.97, and 20.68 μM, respectively (celecoxib; IC
 <sub>50</sub> 0.52 nM), in the COX-2 inhibitory assay by measuring prostaglandin E
 <sub>2</sub> (PGE
 <sub>2</sub>) production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Another study examined the inhibitory effects of the constituents of 
 <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic> on LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) production in mouse peritoneal macrophages [

 <sub>50</sub> values of 24, 24, 50, 69, 83, 31, 47, 11, and 52 μM, respectively (caffeic acid phenyl ester; IC
 <sub>50</sub> 16 μM). In a study comparing the anti-inflammatory effects of a phenylbutenoid-rich fraction of 
 <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic> with four individual phenylbutenoids and other crude extracts according to different extraction methods [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], the phenylbutenoid-rich fraction exhibited the strongest inhibitory activity on LPS-induced NO production in murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells. The phenylbutenoid-rich fraction prepared by one-step silica–gel column chromatography on the hexane extract exhibited an NO inhibitory effect with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 4.6 μg/mL, whereas hexane extracted under reflux and the essential oil obtained by a hydrodistillation inhibited NO production with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 11.9 and 21.5μg/mL, respectively. The compounds (
