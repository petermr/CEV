<p>The rhizomes of 
 <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic> were used as an anti-asthmatic drug in Thai traditional medicine. There have been reports on the pharmacokinetic studies of (
 <italic>E</italic>)-4-(3′,4′-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-1-ol (
 <bold>2</bold>), which has anti-inflammatory action [
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The pharmacokinetics of 
 <bold>2</bold> were studied in rats and monkeys using the in situ intestinal loop technique for asthmatic treatment [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The absorption of this compound reached its maximum at approximately 1 h after oral administration in rats and also exhibited an elimination half-life of approximately 2–2.3 h in both animal models. In addition, the pharmacokinetic profiles of 
 <bold>2</bold>, including absorption, tissue distribution, and route of elimination, in male Wistar rats were also examined [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The compound showed good absorption, which reached its maximum at approximately 0.15 h after drug administration, and an excellent ratio of tissue to plasma that ranged from 1 to 1,000 in organs at 1‒4 h after drug administration. Less than 1% of 
 <bold>2</bold> was detected in feces and urine. The ethanol extract of 
 <italic>Z</italic>. 
 <italic>cassumunar</italic> (5–100 μg/mL) significantly inhibited total mucin production, including MUC2 and MUC5AC mRNA and proteins induced by phorbol12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in human airway epithelial NCI-H292 cells [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The extracts also inhibited phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase but not JNK and p38 in PMA-stimulated NCI-H292 cells. In the follow-up study [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], the ethanol extract and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-4-(3′,4′-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-1-ol (
 <bold>2</bold>) from 
 <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic> inhibited pro-MMP-9 cleavage by MMP-9 in asthma induced by house dust mite allergens. The extracts (100 mg/mL) and compound D (50 and 100 mg/mL) attenuated the PMA-induced MMP-9 gene and expression in NCI-H292 cells. Recently, the analysis of molecular interactions between two constituents of Z. 
 <italic>cassumunar</italic> and a protein target, the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) enzyme, involved with asthma symptoms, were studied using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. (
 <italic>E</italic>)-1-(3′,4′-Dimethoxyphenyl)buta-1,3-diene (
 <bold>1</bold>) and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-4-(3′,4′-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-1-ol (
 <bold>2</bold>) bound at the same catalytic site of its natural substrate (AA) on the 5-LO enzyme. The binding energy calculations of the 5-LO complex with 
 <bold>1</bold>, 
 <bold>2</bold>, and zileuton (anti-asthma agent) were −29.15, −26.83, and −29.40 kcal/mol, respectively, which supports the competition between the 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> substrate inhibitors, which was the same as zileuton [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Overall, these accumulated results indicated that the extracts and components of the 
 <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic> possess potential value in the prevention and treatment of various diseases related to inflammation.
