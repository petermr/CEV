  <italic>Zingiber cassumunar</italic> Roxb. (Zingiberaceae), is an important medicinal plant known as “Plai (Phlai)” in Thailand, “Bangle” in Indonesia, and “Bulei” in China. Traditionally, this plant has been used to treat inflammation, pain, and respiratory problems. The rhizomes are the primary part of the plant that has been used for medicinal purposes due to their constituents with therapeutic properties, including phenylbutenoids, curcuminoids, and essential oils. Since the 1970s, many studies have been conducted on the phytochemicals and bioactivities of 
  <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic> to establish fundamental scientific evidence that supports its use in traditional medicine. The accumulated biological studies on the extracts, solvent fractions, and constituents of 
  <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic> have described their diverse medicinal properties, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, neuroprotective/neurotrophic, cosmeceutical, and antifungal/antimicrobial bioactivities. In this review, we summarize information on the phytochemicals of 
  <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic> and the bioactivities of its extracts and constituents.
