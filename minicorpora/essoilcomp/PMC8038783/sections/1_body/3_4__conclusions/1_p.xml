<p>Our study showed that the results obtained for 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> L. adapted to the climatic conditions of the Andes of northern Chile contain a series of bioactive substances that are easily extracted using non-toxic, inexpensive, and widely available solvents and that exhibit in vitro activity. This species, grown in an arid area, can produce different secondary metabolites while preserving the typical characteristics of the Mediterranean plant. The chemical composition revealed that this herb is a rich source of rosmarinic acid, a compound known for its extremely high antioxidant properties. Besides, it was demonstrated that protocatechuic acid content was higher than that reported for this same plant cultivated under other conditions. Regarding the results obtained, Atacama oregano contains relatively high levels of phenols and total flavonoids that are essential in the human diet and high concentrations of bioactive substances with antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. Furthermore, the activity found for oregano extract on Î±-glucosidase opens the door for the potential use of this plant to manage chronic diseases such as diabetes. The cultivation of this herb in extremely arid conditions provides this common food plant with the ability to be a rich source of bioactive substances that can boost its consumption, not only as a spice but also as natural medicine.
