<p>The 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> L. was introduced more than 100 years ago in Chile, adapting to its unique conditions. One of the oregano growing areas is in the arid region of the Atacama Desert [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-02100" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This growing region is located between 2800 and 3500 m above sea level and presents extreme characteristics for this speciesâ€™ development (low oxygen availability, high solar radiation, water scarcity, sudden changes in temperature during the day and at night) [

 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-02100" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Traditionally, the leaves and flowers of oregano are used by local communities, mainly for their beneficial properties to cure coughs and sore throats and relieve digestive discomfort [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-02100" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> L. from this area is characterized by a limited distribution and scarce raw material sources. In this context, the geographical and environmental conditions of this region could grant these plants unique properties. Therefore, the present research aims to provide the phenolic composition and antimicrobial, antioxidant, and inhibitory activities of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> L. from the Atacama Desert Andean region (ADAR). These results could open a potential interest in the food and pharmaceutical industry, which are always in search of the new bioactive sources.
