<p>Stock standard solutions of all the phenolics (1 mg/mL) were prepared by separately dissolving the accurate amount of each standard into the HPLC grade methanol with sonication aid (for few minutes). Care was taken to ensure that the water bath temperature during sonication does not increase above 30 °C. The stock solutions were stored in the dark at −20 °C. Working standard solutions that contain all the phenolics were prepared, diluting standard stock solutions with the initial mobile phase. The standard solutions were sonicated/vortexed after preparation and before using (injection in the HPLC) in order to ensure maximal solubilization of each compound in the mixture.</p>
