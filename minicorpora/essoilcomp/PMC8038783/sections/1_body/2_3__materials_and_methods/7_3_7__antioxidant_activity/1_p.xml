<p>Because the antioxidant capacity cannot be described with a single method, 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> L. extractâ€™s antioxidant capacities were assayed with three different assays: free radical scavenging (DPPH and ABTS) and reducing power (FRAP) assays. These methods are based on the single electron transfer (SET) reaction, displayed through a change in color as the oxidant is reduced, and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), which measures the activity of the antioxidant to scavenge peroxyl radicals [
