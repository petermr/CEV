<p>The ABTS assay was performed by bleaching the cationic radical ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup> as described by Echiburu-Chau et al. [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-26-02100" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The radical ABTS solution was diluted with absolute ethanol until an initial absorbance of approximately 0.70 ± 0.03 was obtained at 734 nm. The radical discoloration was initiated by adding 20 µL of the stock solution to 200 µL of the ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup> solution. After 7 min of incubation at 25 °C, the absorbance was measured at 734 nm. Results were expressed as micromoles of Trolox equivalents per 100 g of dry sample (µmol TE/100 g DW).
