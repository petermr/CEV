<p>Liquid chromatography parameters were carried out as described by Soto et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-26-02100" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], with some modifications. Analyzes were performed on a Knauer Azura analytical UHPLC system (Knauer, Berlin, Germany), consisting of Azura P 6.1 L pump, 3950 autosamplers, and Azura DAD 2.1 L diode array detector with high sensitivity Knauer. A reversed-phase column (Luna
 <sup>®</sup>, 100 mm × 4.6 mm, 3.0 µm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) was used, and the temperature of the column was kept at 25 °C. The mobile phase consists of two solvents: (A) 1% formic acid in the water, and (B) acetonitrile and the following gradient program was run: at 0 min, the A: B ratio was 95:5; at 3 min, 70:30; at 20 min, 30:70; and at 22 min, 95:5. The system was allowed to run for another 10 min to equilibrate the column before each injection. The flow rate of the mobile phase was 0.7 mL/min. The detection wavelengths were 260 (PRCA, 4-HBA, VA, RUT), 270 (GA, EPIG), 280 (CAT, CIN, NAR, CAR, THY), 320 (CA, PCA, FA, SA), 330 (CLA, RA, KAM) and 360 nm (LUT, API) and DAD was recorded from 200 to 500 nm for peak characterization. Calibration standards were prepared by diluting a concentrated mixture solution with an initial mobile phase in the concentration range of 0.2–20 µg/mL for GA, 0.5–30 µg/mL for RUT, 0.25–10 µg/mL for CIN, and 0.5–20 µg/mL for the rest of phenolics. The most likely identification of phenolics was achieved by comparing the retention times and HPLC spectra of each peak in the sample with those of the respective phenolic compound standards.
