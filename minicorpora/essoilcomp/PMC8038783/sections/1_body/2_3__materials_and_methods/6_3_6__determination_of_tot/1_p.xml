<p>Total phenol content was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteau method with some modifications [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-26-02100" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. From the 1 mg/mL stock solution, an aliquot of 50 µL was mixed with 1000 µL of Folin-Ciocalteau reagent (50%

Each sample was measured at 760 nm in a Synergy™ HTX multimodal microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA) and compared to a calibration curve using gallic acid as the standard. The total flavonoid content was determined by the aluminum chloride colorimetric method [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-26-02100" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Briefly, 250 µL of the stock solution was diluted with 750 µL of distilled water and then 250 µL of 10%

 <sub>2</sub>O solution was added, and the mixture was allowed to stand for 6 min. Then, 250 µL of 1 M NaOH solution and 500 µL of distilled water were added to a final volume of 2500 µL. Each sample was measured at 415 nm in a Synergy™ HTX multimodal microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA) and compared to a calibration curve using quercetin as the standard.
