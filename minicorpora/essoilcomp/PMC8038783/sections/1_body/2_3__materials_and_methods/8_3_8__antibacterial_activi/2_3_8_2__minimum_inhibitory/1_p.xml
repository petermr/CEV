<p>The MIC of oregano extract was determined by the method described by Simirgiotis et al. [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-02100" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] in order to determine the minimum concentration necessary to inhibit bacteria. Working concentrations ranged from 0 to 10 mg/mL of oregano extract. For this purpose, a stock solution of 20 mg/mL of extract. Further dilutions were prepared in nutrient broth previously to inoculate with each bacterium. Each dilution was prepared to a final working volume of 200 µL in 96-well plates and inoculated with the different bacteria to be tested at 25 °C or 35 °C, as appropriate. Nutrient broth without extract was inoculated with each bacterium used as growth control; nutrient broth with 0–10 mg/mL of oregano extract without bacteria was employed as a negative control of growth sterility of the oregano dilution. An assay using 0–90% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) ethanol was performed to estimate the ethanol MIC for each bacterium. Concentrations higher than 20% ethanol was inhibitory for all bacteria. A 40 mg/mL oregano extract was prepared as a stock solution to avoid ethanol’s inhibitory activity during these assays. After 24 h of incubation, the MIC was determined from the lowest extract concentration where no bacterial growth was observed.
