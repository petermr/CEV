<p>The MBC of oregano extract was determined from the last three wells where no bacterial growth was observed in the MIC assay, as described by Simirgiotis et al. [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-02100" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. For this, 100 ÂµL from these wells were taken and plated in nutrient broth plates supplemented with 1.5% agar. As a growth control, a culture with no bacterial inhibitory growth in the MIC test was used. The plates were incubated for 24 h at the corresponding temperature, after which the MBC of oregano extract was determined from nutrient agar plates where no growth was observed.
