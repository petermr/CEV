<p>This assay was carried out according to Picot and Mahomoodally [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-02100" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], with slight modifications. Porcine pancreatic lipase type II was re-suspended in ultrapure water at 20 mg/mL. The substrate 
 <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenyl butyrate (25 mM) was prepared in 5 mM sodium acetate buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. This solution was heated in boiling water for 2 min for a better dissolution and cooled down to room temperature. The assay mixture was 160 µL of 100 mM Tris buffer, 20 µL of sample (31.25–1000 µg/mL), 60 µL of lipase and 180 µL of substrate solution. The mixture was incubated for 60 min at 37 °C and absorbance was read at 405 nm. Orlistat was used as the reference compound.
