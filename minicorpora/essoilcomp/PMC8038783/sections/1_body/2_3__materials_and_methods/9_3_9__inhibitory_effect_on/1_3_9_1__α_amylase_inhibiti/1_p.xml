<p>The α-amylase inhibition assay was carried out as described by Burgos-Edwards et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-26-02100" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] with slight modifications. Briefly, 100 μL of different concentrations of extract (6.25–200 µg/mL) was co-incubated with 100 µL of 1% 
 <italic>w/v</italic> starch for 5 min at 37°C, and then 100 µL of α-amylase solution (10 U/mL) were added and incubated for a further 30 min. At the end of the incubation, 200 µL of the color reagent were added and incubated for 15 min in boiling water. Then, 40 µL of this mixture was diluted with 210 µL of water, and absorbance was measured in a microplate reader at 565 nm (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA). Acarbose was used as the reference compound.
