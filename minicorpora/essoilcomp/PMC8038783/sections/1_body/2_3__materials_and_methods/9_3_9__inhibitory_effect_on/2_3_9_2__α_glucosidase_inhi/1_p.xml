<p>The α-glucosidase inhibition assay was carried out as described by Burgos-Edwards et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-26-02100" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] with slight modifications. Briefly, the reaction mixture contained 20 µL of sodium phosphate buffer (200 mM), 120 μL of of different concentrations of extract (6.25–200 µg/mL) prepared in the same buffer and 20 µL of α-glucosidase (0.30 U/L) solution. After 15 min pre-incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was started by adding 20 µL of 
 <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenyl-α-D-glucopyranoside (1 mM) into the wells. The reaction was further incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Then, absorbance was measured at 415 nm in a microplate reader (BioTek Instrument, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA). Acarbose was used as the reference compound.
