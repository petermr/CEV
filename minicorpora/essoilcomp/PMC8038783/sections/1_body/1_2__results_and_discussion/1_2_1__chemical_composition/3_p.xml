<p>On the other hand, to our knowledge, no previous works have reported similar concentrations of protocatechuic acid in 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> L. Protocatechuic acid has a wide range of biological and pharmacological activities, including antioxidant, antibacterial, anticancer, antiulcer, antidiabetic, among others [
