<p>In previous reports on oregano, different concentrations of the compounds found in OV ADAR are reported. These differences can be attributed to this speciesâ€™ chemical composition that depends on the climate, altitude, harvest time, growth stage, and different extraction methods and experimental protocols. However, these characteristics give the great potential to oregano grown in the Atacama Desert Andean region (ADAR), which could be considered an important natural source of these phenolic compounds. This preliminary characterization of phenolic compounds can help broaden the therapeutic and industrial potential of this species.</p>
