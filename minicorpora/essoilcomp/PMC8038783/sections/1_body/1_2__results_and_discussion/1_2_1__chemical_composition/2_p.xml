 <xref rid="molecules-26-02100-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the concentrations of the phenolic compounds identified in the analyzed sample. The most abundant phenolic acid was rosmarinic acid (76.01 mg/100 g DW), followed by protocatechuic acids (61.99 mg/100 g DW), gallic (43.60 mg/100 g DW), and ferulic (11.72 mg/100 g DW), while chlorogenic acid was found in lower concentrations. In flavonoids, the most abundant compounds were luteolin and naringenin (27.31 and 24.32 mg/100 g DW, respectively). Carvacrol and thymol were also identified. The concentration of phenolic monoterpenes, especially carvacrol, is similar to that reported for the same speciesâ€™ essential oil, where low amounts of this compound were found [

In this context, rosmarinic acid (RA) is the major phenolic acid in several Lamiaceae family plants. Several biological activities are attributed to this compound, so RA has focused on many studies [
