<p>The inhibitory and bactericidal activities of the oregano extract are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02100-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Most bacteria were susceptible to the oregano extract, with a variation in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values from 0.078 mg/mL to 0.625 mg/mL and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values from 1.25 mg/mL to 5.00 mg/mL (

 <italic>Xanthomonas campestris</italic> was resistant to the antimicrobial activity of oregano extract. 
 <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> was the most resistant bacterium to the antibacterial activity of oregano extract, showing the highest minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericide concentrations (0.625 mg/mL and 5.00 mg/mL, respectively). 
 <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> and 
 <italic>Pantoea agglomerans</italic> were the most susceptible phytopathogenic bacteria to oregano extract with the lower concentration necessary to inhibit bacterial growth (0.313 mg/mL MIC and 1.25 mg/mL MBC).
