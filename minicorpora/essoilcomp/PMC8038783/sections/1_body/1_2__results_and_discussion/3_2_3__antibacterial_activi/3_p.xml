<p>It was not possible to determine MBC for 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> due to its ability to produce spores, which would allow surviving the antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> L. extracts. Spores are resistance structures formed by some bacterial genera that allow them to survive under different extreme conditions and chemical treatments [
