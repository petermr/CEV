<p>Previously, Simirgiotis et al. [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-02100" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] reported that essential oils of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> L. from the arid Andean Region of Chile have antibacterial activity against pathogenic and phytopathogenic bacteria. However, this work showed some differences in MIC and MBC activity compared to the same plantâ€™s essential oil. The differences could be explained by the composition and concentration of active metabolites, particularly thymol and carvacrol, described as antimicrobial compounds and present in lower quantities in the extract of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> L., in comparison to the essential oil of the same plant (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02100-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This difference could explain the higher concentrations of extract needed to inhibit and kill the different tested bacteria. However, the oregano extract showed activity against 
 <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> and 
 <italic>P. agglomerans</italic>, which is not observed for essential oils of oregano [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-02100" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Rosmarinic acid has been described as an antimicrobial compound [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-02100" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], which is present in high concentration in the extract of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> L. and could explain the antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> and 
 <italic>P. agglomerans</italic>. Previously, it has been reported the effectiveness of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> L. essential oil to inhibit microbial growth of different food spoiling yeast [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-26-02100" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], which indicates the capacity of oregano oil in the food industry. From this point of view, it is possible to propose using ethanolic extract as an additive, inhibiting the microbial growth of bacteria that could affect the quality of foods, such as 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>S. enterica</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, among others. Nonetheless, organoleptic properties, safety and toxicity issues of this extract still need to be evaluated beforehand.
