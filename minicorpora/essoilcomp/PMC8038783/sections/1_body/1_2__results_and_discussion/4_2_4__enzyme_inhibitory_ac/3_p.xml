<p>Natural products’ phenolic composition is essential to determine the inhibition of key enzymes associated with metabolic syndrome problems. Several reports indicate that extracts containing rosmarinic acid have inhibitory activity on porcine pancreatic amylase in vitro [

 <xref rid="B41-molecules-26-02100" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Besides, herbs containing rosmarinic acid as the main phenolic component have been used in traditional medicine for a long time to treat diabetes
