<p>Oregano varieties are characterized by different qualitative and quantitative compositions of phenolic compounds. 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02100-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows the total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), and antioxidant capacity (DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP) of the 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> L. from ADAR. The total phenols content (TPC) for this plant was 3948 ± 40.17 mg GAE/100 g DW, being higher than those reported for 
 <italic>Thymus citriodorus</italic> L. (1797.28 ± 51.45 mg GAE/100 g DW) [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-02100" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and also to the informed for Rhubarb (
 <italic>Rheum</italic> spp.) that is a plant characterized by its very high antioxidant properties [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-02100" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Furthermore, a higher amount of TPC was observed in oregano from the Atacama than for the same species cultivated in other world regions [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-02100" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-02100" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. While the total flavonoid content (593 ± 30.50 mg QE/100 g DW), were also close to the values reported for the aerial parts of the oregano from northern Iran (521 to 466 mg QE/100 g DW) [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-02100" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. FRAP analysis revealed oregano extract as showing the strongest reducing power than Rheum rhabarbarum [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-02100" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The antioxidant activity values in the ABTS test was 8266 ± 251.50 μmol TE/100 g of DW, being greater than those informed for Macedonia’s medicinal plants, such as Alcea pallida and Saponaria officinalis [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-02100" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], as well for the Rhubarb [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-02100" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These antioxidant results expand the knowledge of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> L. species cultivated under environmental conditions typical of the Atacama Desert’s Andean region. The free radical scavenging activity of DPPH followed the same trend as the essential oil of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> L. [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-02100" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The DPPH test revealed that the oregano extract (40.58 ± 5.41 µg/mL) showed more DPPH scavenging capacity than the report by Teixeira et al. for the same species (64.1 ± 1.2 µg/mL) [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-26-02100" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, the DPPH value found in this work was less than standards Quercetin and Trolox but were close to those reported for some Chilean Nolana species (from 30 to 120 µg/mL) [
