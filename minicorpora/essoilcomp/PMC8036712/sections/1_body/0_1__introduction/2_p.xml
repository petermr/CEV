<p>One of the best-known plants, used as a source of pharmacologically active and nutritional molecules, is 
 <italic>Eleutherococcus senticosus</italic> (Siberian ginseng). The plant is native to Russia, the Far East, China, Korea, and Japan. The fruits of 
 <italic>E. senticosus</italic> have been used in Russia for many years as a tonic on the central nervous system and as an adaptogen. Modern research is focused on elucidation of the pharmacological activities of wild fruits, including their antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anticancer effects. An acidified 80% methanol extract showed high xanthine oxidase and AChE inhibitory activities. The anticancer activity of the extract was also proven by screening various human cell lines, including LNCaP (prostate cells), MOLT-4F (leukemia cells), A549 (lung cells), ACHN (renal cells) HCT-15 (colon cells), and SW-620 (colon cells). The latest reports indicate their immunostimulatory and anti-inflammatory activities and an increase in the number of leukocytes. The intractum from the fruits was found to stimulate human leukocyte resistance to the VSV (
 <italic>Vesicular Stomatitis Virus</italic>) infection via reduction of viral replication, which might be associated with increased secretion of interleukin 10 (IL-10). Besides medical applications, the fruits are industrially used in the production of phyto-jam (0.8â€“1.6 kg/100 kg of the product). Considering the data mentioned above, the consumption of wild edible fruits of 
 <italic>E. senticosus</italic> by local communities in many developing countries is gaining increasing interest [
