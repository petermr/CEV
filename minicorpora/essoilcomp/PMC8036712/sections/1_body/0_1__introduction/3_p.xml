<p>According to the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the pharmacological activity of 
 <italic>E. senticosus</italic> in traditional applications is attributed to secondary metabolites called eleutherosides. They are very varied with saponins, lignans, coumarins, and phenylpropanoids as their aglycons. Eleutheroside B (syringin 4-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucoside) and E ((−)-syringaresinol 4,4″-
 <italic>O</italic>-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-diglucoside) are the major compounds and, according to the European Pharmacopoeia, their sum should not be less than 0.08%. Eleutherosides are thought to be the most active compounds present mainly in the roots. Although the fruits are used as ingredients in the production of galenic formulations, the roots are a major subject of research while the fruits remain largely unknown. The fruits are rich in flavonoids (13.4–14.4 mg/g ext.), polyphenols (38.5–41.1 mg/g ext.), minerals (Ca 3730–4495, Mg 1430–1540, Fe 35.4–53, Mn 75.2–88.3, Zn 18.9–41.0, Cu 3.34–13, Se 0.19–061; mg/kg respectively), and essential oil (0.3%, v/d.w.). Interestingly, a large amount of 
 <italic>myo</italic>-inositol and 
 <sc>d</sc>-mannitol was found as well (267.5 and 492.5 mg/g dry extract, respectively) [
