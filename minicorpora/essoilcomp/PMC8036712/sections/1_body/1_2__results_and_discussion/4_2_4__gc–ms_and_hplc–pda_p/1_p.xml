<p>The oil obtained by hexane extraction of ground fruits constituted 5.4 ± 0.015% of their weight. The oil is a semi-solid, yellow-green substance with a characteristic aroma (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01969-f008">Figure 8</xref>A) absorbing UV–VIS radiation in the range of 190–430 nm and at a wavelength of 660–680 nm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01969-f008">Figure 8</xref>B). Absorbance at a wavelength of 269 nm may indicate the presence of tocopherols, especially α-tocopherol absorbing radiation in the range of 265–310 nm [
