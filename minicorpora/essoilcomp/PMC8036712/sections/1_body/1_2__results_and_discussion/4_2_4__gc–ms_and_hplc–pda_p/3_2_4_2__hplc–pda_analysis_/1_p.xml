<p>Pentacyclic triterpenes are lipophilic compounds present in the oil fraction [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-01969" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. As shown in literature, 
 <italic>E. senticosus</italic> fruits contain ursolic acid [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-01969" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Therefore, the content of this triterpene in 
 <italic>E. senticosus</italic> seed oil was evaluated in the present study. Its content was shown to be 35.72 mg/g of oil (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-01969-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Given the oil content in the fruits, it can be concluded that the ursolic acid content in the fruits is over 1.9 mg/g. Our research shows that 
 <italic>E. senticosus</italic> fruits are a much richer source of ursolic acid than previously thought. Jang et al. found that 100 g of fruits contain about 3.5 mg of ursolic acid [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-01969" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The results obtained by Yangâ€™s team were on lower possibly due to the use of methanol in fruit extraction.
