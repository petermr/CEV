<p>The analysis of the oil by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry showed the presence of five fatty acids, including three unsaturated acids (linoleic, oleic, and α-linolenic acids), the total content of which was 24% (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-01969-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The dominant fatty acid was linoleic acid (over 18%), while the content of α-linolenic acid was only 0.4%. The content of saturated acids was only 2.5%. Thus, the 
 <italic>E. senticosus</italic> fruit oil is a rich source of unsaturated acids, but the proportion of n-3 acids to n-6 acids is not beneficial for human health [
