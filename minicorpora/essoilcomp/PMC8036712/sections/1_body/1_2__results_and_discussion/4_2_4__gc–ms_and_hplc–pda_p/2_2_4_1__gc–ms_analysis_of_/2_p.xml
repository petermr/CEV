<p>The chromatographic analysis (HPLC–PDA) revealed a dominant peak with a retention time of 7.25 min. This peak was identified as a mixture of β- and γ-tocopherols, and their content was determined to be 1.36 mg/g oil. The α- and δ-tocopherol content was 0.29 and 0.33 mg/g of oil, respectively (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-01969-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Grilo et al. assessed the content of tocopherols in commonly used oils (rapeseed, sunflower, corn, and soybean). The content of α-tocopherol ranged from 0.071 to 0.43 mg/g and γ-tocopherol ranged from 0.092 to 0.27 mg/g for soybean and sunflower oils, respectively [

 <italic>E. senticosus</italic> seed oil contains a moderate amount of α-tocopherol. On the other hand, the tested oil may be a valuable source of β- and γ-tocopherols; however, the assessment of the mutual quantitative relationships of these two compounds requires further research and other methods. Ergönül and Köseoğlu have shown that the content of δ-tocopherol in unrefined soybean oil is 0.12 mg/g, while in rapeseed oil it is 0.012 mg/g [

 <italic>E. senticosus</italic> fruit oil is quite a rich source of δ-tocopherol, as it contains nearly three-fold higher amounts of this compound than soybean oil.
