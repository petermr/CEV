<p>HS–SPME coupled with the GC–MS analysis identified 38 volatile constituents (VOCs) in the 
 <italic>E. senticosus</italic> fruits, representing 93.9% of the total number. The detected compounds belong to several classes, such as monoterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated monoterpenes (13.2%) and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (76.6%). The percentage composition of the identified compounds is listed in the elution order in
