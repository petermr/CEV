<p>The characteristic anatomical features of the fruits are shown in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01969-f003">Figure 3</xref>. The anatomical structure of the 
 <italic>E. senticosus</italic> fruits is characteristic for most species from the Araliaceae family. The microscopic studies of the transverse section showed the presence of secretory canals filled with yellow oil droplets in the inner zone of the mesocarp. The presence of druses and yellow oil droplets in the inner zone of the mesocarp and red chromoplasts in the outer zone of the mesocarp visible in the transverse fruit section are distinguishing features that can be used as anatomical markers. This study is a complement of the research conducted by Solomonowa et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-01969" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], in which the morphological-anatomical and morphometric study of fruits were carried out. The morphometric indicators of the fruits are as follows: fruit length 9.95 mm, fruit diameter 4.65, stone length 5.25 mm, and stone width 1.98 mm.
