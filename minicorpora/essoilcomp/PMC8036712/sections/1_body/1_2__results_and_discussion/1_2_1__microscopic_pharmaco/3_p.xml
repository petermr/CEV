<p>The powder microscopy of the fruits (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01969-f003">Figure 3</xref>) shows epidermis cells tightly adjacent to each other. The endocarp contains fibers oriented askew to the stone axis. The secretory canals in the mesocarp are filled with oil, probably essential oil, rounded parenchymatous cells. In turn, the druses and chromoplasts in the mesocarp and fatty oil drops in the endosperm can be considered as diagnostic features. The parameters analyzed here are useful for identification and authentication of this medicinally important plant and will provide the latest knowledge for the development of herbal monographs as recommended by the European Medicines Agency.
