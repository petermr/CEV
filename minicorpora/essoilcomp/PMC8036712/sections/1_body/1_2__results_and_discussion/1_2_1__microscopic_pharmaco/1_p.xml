<p>The quality control of plant-based material is important to ensure the best quality of products. For many years, plant materials imported to Europe have been of bad quality (adulterated or substituted) [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-01969" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]; therefore, to ensure good quality, new protocols for a new herbal material are needed. The fruits of 
 <italic>Eleutherococcus senticosus</italic> species growing in Asia and cultivated in Poland or other European countries have not yet been evaluated in terms of pharmacognostic features. The poor-quality plant material now offered on the market necessitates development of proper well-controlled production procedures. The development of a pharmacognostic protocol including microscopic and phytochemical studies will help in identification of these fruits and protect from adulteration.
