<p>BÄ…czek [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-01969" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] showed that the content of eleutherosides B and E in methanol fruit extract obtained from a 4-year-old plant was 35.6 and 29.7 (mg/100g), respectively. It should be mentioned that eleutherosides were not present in the fruits of 2- and 3-year-old plants, respectively. Unfortunately, the authors did not provide information about the calculation, i.e., it was not specified whether 100 g referred to the plant material or the extract. This makes the comparison difficult and, in many cases, unreliable. Taking into consideration the sum of eleutheroside B and E, the extract from the whole fruits contains a higher quantity of eleutherosides. However, it is very important that the pericarp contains more eleutherosides than the seeds, which means that the seeds may be used in the micropropagation of the species. 
 <italic>Eleutherococcus senticosus</italic> is included in the Red List in some countries [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-26-01969" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; in this case, the pericarp may serve as a source of eleutherosides, while the seed (embryo) may be used for in vitro germination to develop seedlings and increase the number of botanical specimens.
