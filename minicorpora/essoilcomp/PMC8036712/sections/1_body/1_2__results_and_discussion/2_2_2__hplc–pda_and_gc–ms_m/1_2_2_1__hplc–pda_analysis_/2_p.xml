<p>The extraction of the fruits, seeds, and pericarp obtained from the 4-year-old plant resulted in 20, 26, and 33% dry extract yield, respectively. No data on the characterization of the anatomical parts of 
 <italic>E. senticosus</italic> fruits and the distribution of their active constituents have been published before. Plant metabolites exhibit a very broad range of polarities. This means that only part of the plantâ€™s chemodiversity is present in any plant extract. Among the three studied eleutherosides (eleutheroside B, E, and E1), only eleutheroside B and E have been found in the largest amount in the whole fruits i.e., 0.66 and 0.74 mg/g d. ext., respectively (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01969-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Considering the distribution of these compounds, a higher quantity was noticed in the pericarp than in the seeds; however, there was no significant difference between the pericarp and seeds, especially in the case of eleutheroside E. The latest studies conducted by Graczyk et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-26-01969" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] have revealed the absence of eleutherosides in the intractum made of the fresh fruits. This may result from their medium polarity. Eleutherosides are usually well extracted with 75% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) methanol or ethanol; therefore, we suppose that the ethanol concentration (40% 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) used to prepare the intractum may have been too low to extract eleutherosides. Moreover, the extraction of the whole fruits also means that some compounds will not be extracted, and the intractum was prepared through maceration, while ultrasounds were applied in this study.
