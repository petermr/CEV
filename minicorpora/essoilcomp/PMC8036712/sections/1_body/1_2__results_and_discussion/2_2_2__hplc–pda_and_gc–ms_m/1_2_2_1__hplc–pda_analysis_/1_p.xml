<p>For the analysis of the metabolome, such approaches as HPLC, TLC–UV, GC–MS, LC-MS, MS
 <sup>n</sup>, and NMR-spectrometry are currently used. TLC coupled with densitometry and HPLC or HPLC–MS have usually been applied to analyze eleutherosides. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is a leading technique for detection of plant-based metabolites and is very often used as a pilot technique for separation and identification of phytochemicals [
