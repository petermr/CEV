<p>The practical aspect of the present results may be the application of the fruits as an ingredient of plant-based products used to treat immune-related diseases, as confirmed by Graczyk et al. [

With their chlorogenic acid content, the fruit extracts can be examined as a skin-whitening agent acting as tyrosinase inhibitor and possibly used in the cosmetic industry. In addition to this, we did not find information on doses used in ethnomedicine, showing the need of re-confirmation of the fruitsâ€™ activity with regard to therapeutically active doses. Based on these results, the fruits may be a substitution for the roots to prevent exploitation of this endangered plant in some countries. This study has clearly shown that the species can be cultivated in Europe, producing biologically active metabolites.
