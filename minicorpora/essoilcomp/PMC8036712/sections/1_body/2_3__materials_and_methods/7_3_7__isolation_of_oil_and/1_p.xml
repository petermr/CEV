<p>Air-dried and pulverized fruits (5 g) were extracted four times with hexane (4 × 30 mL) using an ultra-sonic bath (4 × 15 min.) The extracts were combined and evaporated in a rotary evaporator. The oil (50 mg) was placed in a volumetric flask (5 mL) and dissolved in 2-propanol. The solution was filtered through a 0.25 µm polyamide membrane filter before HPLC analysis. The oil (10 mg) was dissolved in 500 μL of TBME and derivatized by the addition of 250 μL of TMSH. The whole sample was shaken vigorously, and the GC–MS analysis was performed.</p>
