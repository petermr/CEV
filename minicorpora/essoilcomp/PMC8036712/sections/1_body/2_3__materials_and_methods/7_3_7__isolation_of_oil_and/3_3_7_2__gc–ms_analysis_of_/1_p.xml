<p>The analysis was performed using an Agilent GC–MSD system (GC/MSD 6890N/5975) equipped with a HP-88 Agilent capillary column (60 m × 0.25 mm; 0.20 μm film thickness), MSD ChemStation ver. E.02.02.1431 software (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and a split–splitless injector. The oven temperature was programmed from 110 °C to 190 °C with 8 °C/min, held for 2 min at 110 °C and 13 min at 190 °C. The temperature of the injector was 250 °C. The injection volume was 1 μL (split ratio 150:1; split flow 180 mL/min). Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.2 mL/min. A quadrupole mass spectrometer with electron ionization (EI) at 70 eV and with a full scan type acquisition mode (50 
 <italic>m/z</italic> to 500 
 <italic>m/z</italic>) was used as a detector connected with the GC. The temperature of the MS source and the MS quadrupole was set at 230 °C and 150 °C, respectively. Identification of the constituents was based on a comparison of their mass spectra with the mass spectra library NIST resources and retention times with standards.
