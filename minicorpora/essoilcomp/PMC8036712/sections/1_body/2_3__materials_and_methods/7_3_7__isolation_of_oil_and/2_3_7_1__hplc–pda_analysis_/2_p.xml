<p>Tocopherols were determined using an isocratic system. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and methanol (5:95 
 <italic>v/v</italic>). The eluent flow rate was 1.2 mL/min. The column temperature was set at 30 °C. The injection volume was 5 μL. The quantitative analysis was performed using a fluorescence detector with an excitation wavelength at λ = 296 nm and an emission wavelength at λ = 330 nm.
