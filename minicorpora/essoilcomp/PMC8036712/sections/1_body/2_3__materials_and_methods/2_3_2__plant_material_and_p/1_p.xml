<p>Mature fruits of 4-year-old 
 <italic>Eleutherococcus senticosus</italic> were collected in the Garden of Medicinal and Cosmetic Plants in Bydgoszcz (Poland) in September 2017 (N: 53°07′36.55″ E: 18°01′51.64″). The plant sample was deposited at the Department of Pharmaceutical Botany and Pharmacognosy, Collegium Medicum, Bydgoszcz, Poland, Cat. Nr. ES 10/2018. Air-dried and powdered fruits (10 g each) were soaked in 100 mL of 75% ethanol for 24 h. Next, the samples were subjected to triple UAE-type extraction (ultrasonic bath—Polsonic, Warsaw, Poland) using 100 and 2 × 50 mL of 75% ethanol. The extraction was performed at room temperature for 15 min for each cycle. Finally, 200 mL of each extract was obtained. After that, the extract was filtered through Whatman no. 4 filter paper. The solvent was dried with an evaporator in vacuum conditions at 45 °C, frozen at −20 °C, and subjected to lyophilization. The dried residue was stored in an exsiccator at 4 °C. The extraction yield was calculated based on the dry weight of the extract [%]. The same steps were made for extraction of the pericarp and seeds.
