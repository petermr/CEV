<p>The analyses were performed on an EliteLaChrom chromatograph with a PDA detector and EZChrom Elite software (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The chromatographic system was as follows: a C18 reversed phase core-shell column (Kinetex, Phenomenex, Aschaffenburg, Germany) (25 cm × 4.6 mm i.d., 5 μm particle size), a mixture of water (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B) with 0.025% of trifluoroacetic acid, and the following gradient elution program: 0.0–5.0 min A 95%, B 5%; 5–60 min A from 5 to 20% and B from 95–80%. The flow rate of the mobile phase was 1.0 mL/min and the temperature of thermostat was set at 25 °C. Data were collected between 210 and 400 nm. The identity of compounds was established by comparison of retention times and UV spectra with the corresponding standards. Quantitative analysis was performed at λ = 326 nm for chlorogenic acids and λ = 260 nm for protocatechuic acid. The chromatographic parameters and calibration data for quantification of the investigated phenolic acids are provided in
