<p>The standards of eleutheroside B (≥98.0%), eleutheroside E (≥98.0%), eleutheroside E1 (≥98.0%), protocatechuic acid (≥97%), ursolic acid (≥90%), δ-tocopherol, (+)-γ-tocopherol, (±)-α-tocopherol (analytical standards), methyl palmitate (≥99.0%), methyl stearate (≥99.5%), methyl oleate (≥99.0%), methyl linoleate (≥98.5%), methyl linolenate (≥99.0%), 2-propanol (99.9%), hexane (≥95%), phosphoric acid (≥85%), trimethylsulfonium hydroxide (TMSH) (0.25 M methanolic solution), gradient grade acetonitrile, and trifluoroacetic acid (≥99%) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). LC grade methanol (MeOH) was purchased from J.T. Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ, USA). Water for HPLC was purified by ULTRAPURE Millipore Direct-Q
 <sup>®</sup> 3UV-R (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Tert-butyl methyl ether (TBME) (99.8%) was purchased from Avantor Performance Materials Poland S.A. (Gliwice, Poland). All other reagents were of analytical grade. Eleutheroside standards were dissolved in 75% methanol (final concentration of 0.16, 0.16, and 0.36 mg/mL for eleutheroside B, E, and E1, respectively). Phenolic acid standards and ursolic acid were dissolved in methanol (final concentration of 0.24, 1.04, 0.23, 0.30, and 0.50 mg/mL for neochlorogenic, chlorogenic, cryptochlorogenic, protocatechuic, and ursolic acid, respectively). Standard solutions were prepared by dilution of stock solutions to appropriate concentrations.
