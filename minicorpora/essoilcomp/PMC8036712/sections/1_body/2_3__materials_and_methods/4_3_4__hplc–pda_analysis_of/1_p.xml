<p>The analyses were performed on an EliteLaChrom chromatograph with a PDA detector and EZChrom Elite software (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The following chromatographic system was used: an RP18e LiChrospher 100 column (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) (25 cm × 4.0 mm i.d., 5 µm particle size) at 25 °C; mixtures of water (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B) both acidified with 0.025% of trifluoroacetic acid were used as the mobile phase. The compounds were separated by gradient elution with the following program: 0.0–8.0 min A 90%, B 10%; 8.1–18.0 min A 90–80%, B 10–20%; 18.1–30.0 min A 80%; B 20%; 30.1–45.0 min A 0%, B 100%; 45.1–60.0 min A 90%, B 10%. The flow rate was 1.0 mL/min. Data were collected between 190 and 400 nm. The identity of compounds was established by comparison of retention times and UV spectra with the corresponding standards. Quantitative analysis was performed at λ = 264 nm for eleutheroside B and λ = 206 nm for eleutheroside E and E1. The chromatographic parameters and calibration data for quantification of the investigated eleutherosides are provided in
