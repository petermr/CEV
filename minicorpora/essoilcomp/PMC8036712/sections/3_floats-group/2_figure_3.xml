  <p>Diagnostic features of powdered fruits. 
   <bold>1</bold>. Polygonal cells of fruit epidermis (exocarp). 
   <bold>2</bold>. Inner layers of endocarp cells are represented by fibers, oriented askew to stone axis (2A—tangential section, 2B—transverse section). 
   <bold>3</bold>. Secretory canal (cross-section) in mesocarp, parenchymal cells (3A—visible oil content). 
   <bold>4</bold>. Outer part of the mesocarp composed of parenchymal cells containing red plastids (chromoplasts). 
   <bold>5</bold>. Druses in mesocarp cells located closer to the endocarp. 
   <bold>6</bold>. Drops of fatty oil from the endosperm. 
   <bold>7</bold>. Seed coat built of large cells with brown contents. Diagnostic features of the fruits. s.c.—seed coat, end.—endosperm, i.mes.—inner zone of mesocarp, s.ch.—secretory canals, s.—secretion (essential oil), dr.—druses, ch.—chromoplasts.
