  <p>GC–MS chromatogram of 
   <italic>Eleutherococcus senticosus</italic> fruit oil. 1-(Z)-β-farnesene; 2-α-bergamotene; 3-α-farnesene; 4-β-cubebene; 5-methyl palmitate; 6-methyl stearate; 7-trimethylsulfonium ursolate; 8-methyl oleate; 9-methyl linoleate; 10-methyl linolenate. HP-88 Agilent 45 capillary column (60 m × 0.25 mm; 0.20 μm film thickness). The oven temperature was programmed from 110 °C to 190 °C with 8 °C/min held for 2 min at 110 °C and 13 min at 190 °C. The temperature of the injector was 250 °C. Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.2 mL/min A quadrupole mass spectrometer with electron ionization (EI) at 70 eV and with a full scan type acquisition mode (50 
   <italic>m/z</italic> to 500 
   <italic>m/z</italic>) was used as a detector connected with GC. The temperature of the MS source and the MS quadrupole was set to 230 °C and 150 °C, respectively.
