  <italic>Eleutherococcus senticosus</italic> (Rupr. et Maxim.) Maxim. is a medicinal plant used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for thousands of years. However, due to the overexploitation, this species is considered to be endangered and is included in the Red List, e.g., in the Republic of Korea. Therefore, a new source of this important plant in Europe is needed. The aim of this study was to develop pharmacognostic and phytochemical parameters of the fruits. The content of polyphenols (eleutherosides B, E, E1) and phenolic acids in the different parts of the fruits, as well as tocopherols, fatty acids in the oil, and volatile constituents were studied by the means of chromatographic techniques [HPLC with Photodiode-Array Detection (PDA), headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS–SPME/GC–MS)]. To the best of our knowledge, no information is available on the content of eleutherosides and phenolic acids in the pericarp and seeds. The highest sum of eleutheroside B and E was detected in the whole fruits (1.4 mg/g), next in the pericarp (1.23 mg/g) and the seeds (0.85 mg/g). Amongst chlorogenic acid derivatives (3-CQA, 4-CQA, 5-CQA), 3-CQA was predominant in the whole fruits (1.08 mg/g), next in the pericarp (0.66 mg/g), and the seeds (0.076 mg/g). The oil was rich in linoleic acid (C18:3 (n-3), 18.24%), ursolic acid (35.72 mg/g), and α-tocopherol (8.36 mg/g). The presence of druses and yellow oil droplets in the inner zone of the mesocarp and chromoplasts in the outer zone can be used as anatomical markers. These studies provide a phytochemical proof for accumulation of polyphenols mainly in the pericarp, and these structures may be taken into consideration as their source subjected to extraction to obtain polyphenol-rich extracts.
