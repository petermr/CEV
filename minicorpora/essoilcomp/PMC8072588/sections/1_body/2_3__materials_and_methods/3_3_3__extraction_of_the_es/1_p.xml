<p>At first, preliminary extractions using three distinguished techniques—hydro, steam, and microwaves distillation—were done, subjecting the aerial part of 
 <italic>Thymus algeriensis</italic> Boiss. in order to choose the best technique that showed the highest yield. Next, hydrodistillation was chosen to perform the extraction of the leaves; the extraction process was done after weighting 300 g of the plane leaves directly immersed in the boiling flask of the hydrodistillation system (Clevenger trap). The hydrodistillation process was achieved until there was no significant increase in the volume of the EOs recovered (average of 4 h). The EOs were recovered and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>). Finally, the EOs were kept in a refrigerator at +3 °C in a sealed vial pending analysis. The EO yield was determined as the ratio between the mass of essential oil recovered and the mass of the primary plant material treated.
