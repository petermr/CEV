<p>The recovered volatile oils were analyzed by GC-MS, using a Shimadzu GC-MS-QP2010 (Tokyo, Japan) quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with the same fused bonded column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 µm film thickness) used in the GC-FID analysis (Rtx-5MS). The oven temperature was fixed at 45 °C for 2 min; then, it was increased to 300 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min and then left at 300 °C for 5 min. The injection port temperature was 250 °C, while the detector temperature was set at 330 °C, and the injection was done in the split mode with a split ratio of 80:1. The carrier gas used was helium (99.995% purity) with a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min. The mass spectrometer conditions were as follows: ionization voltage 70 eV, ion source temperature 200 °C, and electron ionization mass spectra were acquired over the mass range of 45–500 m/z.</p>
