 <sup>• +</sup>) radical cation depolarization assay is one of the spectrophotometric analyses extensively used for the estimation of the antioxidant activity. The ability of our extracts (EOs) to scavenge (ABTS
 <sup>• +</sup>) radicals was achieved according to the protocol described by Rajurkar and Hande [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-10-00786" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. ABTS reagent was prepared and then stored in the dark at room temperature for 12–16 h before use. The next day, ABTS reagent solution was diluted with methanol until we obtained an absorbance value that ranged between 1.03 and 734 nm. Next, 1 mL of the prepared diluted ABTS reagent solution was mixed with 0.3 mL of different EOs concentrations. The mixture was well agitated and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 10 min. Finally, the percentage of inhibition for the extracts was determined using the following Formula (2) 
 <disp-formula>ABTS
  <sup>•+</sup> scavenging effect (%) = ((AB − AA)/AB) × 100
  <label>(2)</label>
 </disp-formula> where AB is absorbance of ABTS radical + methanol; and AA is absorbance of ABTS radical sample [
