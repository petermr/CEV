<p>Three pathogenic bacteria were selected: Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9314, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 43,300, Escherichia coli (Ec), one Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATCC 4226, three fungi Candida albicans IPA200 (Ca IPA2), Candida tropicalis (Ct), and Candida glabrata (Cg). These strains of bacteria—Candida tropicalis (Ct), Candida glabrata (Cg), and Escherichia coli (Ec)—belong to the collection of the LBSM laboratory (Laboratory of Biology of Microbial Systems of ENS-Kouba, Algeria). Antimicrobial sensitivity of the three essential oils was assessed by a classic disk.</p>
