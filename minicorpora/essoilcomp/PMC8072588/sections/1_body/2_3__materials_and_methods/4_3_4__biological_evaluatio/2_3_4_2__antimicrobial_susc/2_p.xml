Negative control was prepared with the same volume of methanol, and Amoxicillin and Itraconazole (25 µg/disk) were used as the positive control. After incubation for 24 h at 37 °C, the antibacterial activity was assessed by measuring the diameter of the zones of inhibition against the tested microbes.
