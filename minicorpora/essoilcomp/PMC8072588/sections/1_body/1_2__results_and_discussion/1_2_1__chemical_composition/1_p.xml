 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00786-f001">Figure 1</xref>), while the qualitative results were taken from the GC-MS technique. The results of extraction yield of the samples collected during the flowering plant stage, after using the hydrodistillation of both parts “all areal part” and “leaves”, were 1.30% and 1.53%. A total of eighty-five compounds were identified for both parts, which presented about 95.99 and 98.97% for areal parts and leaves samples, respectively.
