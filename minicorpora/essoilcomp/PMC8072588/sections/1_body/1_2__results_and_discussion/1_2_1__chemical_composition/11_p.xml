<p>The comparison of these results with those reported in the literature showed some differences vis-à-vis the major components of the essential oil as well as in the different constituents identified. Dob et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-10-00786" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] found that the 
 <italic>Thymus algeriensis</italic> essential oil was dominated by oxygenated monoterpenes, which was followed by monoterpenes hydrocarbons, sesquiterpenes, hydrocarbons, and oxygenated sesquiterpenes, where linalool and thymol were found as major constituents of this essential oil. The α-pinene was identified as the minor compound in this study (3.74%). These results disagreed with those reported by Ali et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-10-00786" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], who detected the presence of α-pinene as the major compound (20.50%). The qualitative and quantitative analysis results of 
 <italic>Thymus algeriensis</italic> essential oil are similar to those marked by Hamdani et al., [
 <xref rid="B29-plants-10-00786" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and Nacim et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-plants-10-00786" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], with a small variation in the major compound content. Thymol and carvacrol were identified as major compound by Milos [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-10-00786" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]; those compounds were absent in the studied essential oil. The differences in the oil quantity may be attributed to the harvest time, the distillation mode, and the geographic and climatic factors.
