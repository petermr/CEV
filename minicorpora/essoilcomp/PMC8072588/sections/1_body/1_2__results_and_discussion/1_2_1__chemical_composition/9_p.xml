<p>From this result, the best extraction method for oil production (leaves HD EOs) will be relied upon for use in the rest of the study with a comparison of the root scavenging of leaves and the aerial part EOs. The best way to obtain a good yield of oils in the case of obtaining this raw material from the aerial parts of thyme turned out to be extraction by hydrodistillation (HD) in the period after flowering of the plants; in the case of camphene harvesting, obtaining oils during flowering gave a homogeneous oil content as well as after flowering (
