<p>The measures of variability (dispersion) characterize the statistical community, considering the differences between the individual units that make it up. They characterize the degree of diversity of the community due to the distinguished variable features. The study uses both classic measures of variability, such as variance, standard deviation, and classical variation coefficient, as well as positional measures, such as range and skewness. The characteristics of the measures of the examined features are presented in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00786-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The feature that best describes the stability of the assessed quality features is the coefficient of variation, which is a relative measure of diversity, informing about the strength of diversity of the surveyed population in terms of the variable feature and enabling the evaluation of the arithmetic mean. The higher the coefficient value, the stronger the differentiation, and vice versa. The retention indexes turned out to be the most stable features, and the content of essential oils in the leaves marked during flowering was the most variable (
