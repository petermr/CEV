<p>These experiments revealed that the hydrodistillation (HD) of leaves in the flowering period is the best choice. The results showed especially that oil extracted from local populations of 
 <italic>Thymus algeriensis</italic> is rich in camphor, borneol, camphine, 1,8 cineole, and bordyl acetate, in addition to several other organic compounds. Several biological tests were done, especially the antitumor test against colon cancer cell line HCT116, which is according to our literature survey the first study testing this plant EO against this kind of cell cancer. Furthermore, the results were quite amazing comparing with the reference used in this work, which was “Doxorubicin”; in our next experiments, the isolation of the bioactive compounds and re-testing will be more important.
