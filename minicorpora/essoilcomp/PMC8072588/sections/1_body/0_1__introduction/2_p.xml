 <xref rid="B3-plants-10-00786" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-plants-10-00786" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. EOs can be extracted from various parts of plants, such as roots, rhizome, tubers, leaves, stems, bark, buds, flowers, inflorescences, seeds, and fruits, depending on the species and variety [

 <xref rid="B6-plants-10-00786" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Then, the recovered extracted EOs could be used in a wide variety of biological activities such as anti-cancer [
