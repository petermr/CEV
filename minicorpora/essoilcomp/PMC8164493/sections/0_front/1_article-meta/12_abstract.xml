 <p id="Par1">Infectious diseases caused by multidrug-resistant microorganisms has increased in the last years. 
  <italic>Piper</italic> species have been reported as a natural source of phytochemicals that can help in combating fungal and bacterial infections. This study had as objectives characterize the chemical composition of the essential oil from 
  <italic>Piper caldense</italic> (EOPC), evaluate its potential antimicrobial activity, and investigate the synergistic effect with Norfloxacin against multidrug-resistant 
  <italic>S. aureus</italic> overproducing efflux pumps, as well as, verify the EOPC ability to inhibit the 
  <italic>Candida albicans</italic> filamentation. EOPC was extracted by hydrodistillation, and the chemical constituents were identified by gas chromatography, allowing the identification of 24 compounds (91.9%) classified as hydrocarbon sesquiterpenes (49.6%) and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (39.5%). Antimicrobial tests were performed using a 96-well plate microdilution method against 
  <italic>C. albicans</italic> ATCC 10231, 
  <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC 25922 and 
  <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 25923 standard strains, as well as against multidrug-resistant strains 
  <italic>S. aureus</italic> SA1199B (overexpressing 
  <italic>norA</italic> gene), 
  <italic>S. aureus</italic> K2068 (overexpressing 
  <italic>mepA</italic> gene) and 
  <italic>S. aureus</italic> K4100 (overexpressing 
  <italic>qacC</italic> gene). The oil showed activity against 
  <italic>C. albicans</italic> ATCC 10231 (≥ 512 µg/mL) and was able to inhibit hyphae formation, an important mechanism of virulence of 
  <italic>C. albicans</italic>. On the other hand, EOPC was inactive against all bacterial strains tested (≤ 1,024 µg mL). However, when combined with Norfloxacin at subinhibitory concentration EOPC reduced the Norfloxacin and Ethidium bromide MIC values against 
  <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains SA1199B, K2068 and K4100. These results indicate that EOPC is a source of phytochemicals acting as NorA, MepA and QacC inhibitors.
