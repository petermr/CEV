<p id="Par18">EOPC tested in the present showed a weak antifungal activity against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> ATCC 10231 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). This antifungal activity could be related with the presence of some constituents such as Caryophyllene oxide, a compound described as showing antifungal activity against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and dermatophyte fungi (Ghavam et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2020</xref>; Schmidt et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2010</xref>; Yang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">1999</xref>). However, the Caryophyllene oxide content found in the oil tested in the present study was lower (11.9%) than that verified for the EOPC from Piraquara, PR (13.9%), which did not show activity against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> INCQ40006 and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> URM4387 (Bezerra et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2020</xref>). Thus, we cannot rule out that other oil constituents acting isolatelly or synergistically could be related with the antifungal activity showed by the EOPC tested in the present study. As an example, Spathulenol, a sesquiterpene reported to be between major volatile components of the essential oils of several aromatic Piperaceae species, has some biological activities, including antimicrobial activity (Dib et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2017</xref>). Coming from the cyclization of nerolidine pyrophosphate, δ-cadinene presents a cadinane skeleton, which the precursor is the farnesyl pyrophosphate (RuizReyes and Suarez 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2015</xref>). Among the activities reported in the literature for δ-cadinene can be mentioned the antitumor activity (Wright and Sutherland 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2007</xref>), antimicrobial activity (Skaltsa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2003</xref>). Thus, the antifungal activity observed in our approach could be associated to the levels of the compounds related to the local environments and conditions to which the assayed plant was exposed, acting possibly by a synergistic effect.
