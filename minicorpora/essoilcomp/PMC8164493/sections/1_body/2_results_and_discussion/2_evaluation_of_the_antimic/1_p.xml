<p id="Par17">MIC values above 1000 µg/mL for plant extracts have been considered as clinically irrelevant, because it may be impracticable to extrapolate the dose from that giving activity in vitro, to that which would be required in equivalence for the size of a human adult (Houghton et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2007</xref>). Using this value as a cutoff point, the EOPC did not show antimicrobial activity against bacterial strains tested (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Similar results were verified for other 
 <italic>Piper</italic> species, such as, 
 <italic>P. rivinoides</italic> (Leal et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2019b</xref>) and 
 <italic>Piper cernuum</italic> (Leal et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2019a</xref>) that also did not present activity against both 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. However, a previous studies found a diferente result where the EOPC showed activity against Gram-negative 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, as well as, against Gram-positive species 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (Rocha et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2016</xref>).
