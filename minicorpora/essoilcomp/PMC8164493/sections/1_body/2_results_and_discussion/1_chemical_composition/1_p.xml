<p id="Par16">The content of the EOPC was 14.74% and 24 constituents (91.9%) were identified (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Chemical compounds were separated into groups, according to their chemical classification as hydrocarbon sesquiterpenes (49.6%), oxygenated sesquiterpenes (39.5%) and hydrocarbon monoterpenes (2.9%). Oxygenated monoterpenes were not found in the EOPC. Caryophyllene oxide (11.9%) was the major constituent found, followed by δ-Cadinene (9.6%) and Spathulenol (9.1%) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Chemical composition of the EOPC used in the present study (from Antonina, PR at 14 m elevation) was different to that verified by the EOPC from Piraquara, PR (528 m elevation), with nine different compounds as follow: trans-Caryophyllene, β-Copaene, Trans-α-bergamotene, α-Amorfene, β-Selinene and Valencene (Bezerra et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2020</xref>). Variations in the chemical composition of the EOPC are probably associated with different edaphomatic and rainfall conditions in the region where the specimen was found (Viana et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2019</xref>). Seasonality, circadian rhythm, temperature and brightness, as well as the stage of development and nutritional factors, are all likely to influence the chemical composition of essential oils.
