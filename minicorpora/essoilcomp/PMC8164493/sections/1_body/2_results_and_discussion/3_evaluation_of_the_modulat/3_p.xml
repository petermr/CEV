<p id="Par22">NorA is a proton motive-dependent efflux pump belongs to Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS), meanwhile MepA is a member of the Multidrug and Toxin Extrusion (MATE) superfamily, which is dependent of H
 <sup>+</sup> or Na
 <sup>+</sup> gradient to extrude Norfloxacin or EtBr (Schindler et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2014</xref>). To guarantee the integrity and functioning of NorA, there must be a continuous proton-driving force, integrity of DNA zones responsible for the synthesis of membrane proteins and balance in the permeability of substances inside the cell (Thai et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2015</xref>). The modulating effect verified for EOPC could be provoked by interaction of their hydrophobic monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes constituents, leading to plasma membrane damage and dissipation of the proton gradient (Souza et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2013</xref>; Ahmad et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2013</xref>), resulting in the NorA and MepA inhibition. As a consequence, the intracellular concentrations of Norfloxacin becomes enough to inactivate their intracellular targets increasing its antibacterial effect against the 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains tested. Thus, the EOPC could be used in combination to Norfloxacin aiming to enhancing the effectiveness of this antibiotic against multidrug-resistent 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> overproducers of NorA or MepA.
