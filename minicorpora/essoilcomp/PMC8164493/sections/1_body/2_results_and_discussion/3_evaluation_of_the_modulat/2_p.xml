<p id="Par21">To verify if the modulating effect is related with efflux pump inhibition, assays were performed replacing Norfloxacin by EtBr. As the only known mechanism of bacterial resistance to EtBr is mediated by efflux pumps (Markham et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1999</xref>), this DNA-intercalating dye have been used to evaluate the potential efflux pump inhibitory activity of natural products (Silva et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2021a</xref>), isolated phytochemicals (Silva et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2021b</xref>) and synthetic compounds (Faillace et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2021</xref>; Costa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2016</xref>). Results showed that EOPC was also able to modulate the resistance to EtBr in both SA1199B (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B) and K2068 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B) strains. These results indicate the presence of compounds acting as NorA and MepA inhibitors which could be used against Norfloxacin-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains overproducers of efflux pumps, leading to a higher antibiotic accumulation in the bacterial cell.
