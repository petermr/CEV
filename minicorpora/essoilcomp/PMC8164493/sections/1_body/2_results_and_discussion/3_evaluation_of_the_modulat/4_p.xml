 <italic>S. aureus</italic> K4100 overexpressing the 
 <italic>qacC</italic> gene (Littlejohn et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1991</xref>) once the EOPC potentiate the activity of EtBr, indicating that the oil is able to inhibit QacC. MIC values for EtBr against K4100 decreased eightfold in the presence of the oil from 32 to 4 µg/mL (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). QacC is a proton motive-dependent efflux pump that confer resistance to EtBr and quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs), as Benzalkonium Chloride (Schindler et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2014</xref>). Biocide agents such as QACs are widely used in the disinfection of surfaces mainly in hospitals, outpatient clinics, dentist offices, as well as, veterinary clinics, being including effectiveness in the SARS-CoV inactivation (Kamp et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2020</xref>). This intensive use can contribute for emergence of QAC-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains overproducers of QacC (Schindler et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2014</xref>). Thus, the EOPC could be used in association with QACs aiming to eliminate these multidrug strains present in surfaces preventing outbreaks of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections in hospital environments.
