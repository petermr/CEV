<p id="Par20">EOPC potentiated the activity of Norfloxacin against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> SA1199B overproducing NorA, as well as, against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> K2068 overproducing MepA at subinhibitory concentrations. MIC values for Norfloxacin against SA1199B decreased eightfold in the presence of the oil from 64 to 8 µg/mL (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). For K2068 strain, MIC values for Norfloxacin also were reduced eightfold when the EOPC was added to the growth medium from 16 to 2 µg/mL (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). These results indicate that EOPC contains phytochemicals able to modulate the Norfloxacin resistance, probably by inhibition of the NorA and MepA efflux pumps.
