<p id="Par24">Assays for evaluation of morphological transition of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> were performed in the presence and absence of subinhibitory concentrations of EOPC. The fungus grown in the absence of oil showed a clear morphological transition, being possible to observe the presence of blastospores and hyphae (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). On the other hand, EOPC showed potential to inhibit fungal dimorphism at 512 µg/mL (MIC) and at subinhibitory concentration 256 µg/mL (MIC 1/2). However, at 128 µg/mL, it was possible to observe the presence of pseudo-hyphae. Thus, besides antifungal activity, EOPC demonstrating a clear inhibition of the morphological transition in

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2020</xref>) once they verified inhibition of hyphae projection just at 2048 µg/mL.
