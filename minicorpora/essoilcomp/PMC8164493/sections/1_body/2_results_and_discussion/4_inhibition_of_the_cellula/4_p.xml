<p id="Par27">Although there are several antifungals available on the market, the high frequency of resistant strains becomes worrying and borderline in several clinical conditions. Thus, the EOPC tested in the present study could be applied as an agent able to inhibit the conversion of commensal yeast cells of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> in filamentous and pathogenic forms, in the treatment or prevention of candidiasis. It is important to note that cell differentiation is regulated by intracellular signaling pathways, including cAMP-PKA and MAPK pathways (Han et al.

Regarding the inhibition of the filamentous form of fungi, it is suggested that inhibition of the Efg1 transcription factor associated with the PKA pathway, which stimulates the transcription of genes that participate in the formation of hyphae (Stoldt et al.
