<p id="Par25">Hyphae projection by fungi such as 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> is an adaptation process to environmental changes such as temperature, pH or nutrient depletion, and filamentous forms generally promote invasive diseases and hinder the action of antifungals (Wightman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2004</xref>; Barbedo and Sgarbi 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2010</xref>; Veses and Gow 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2014</xref>). Development of pseudo-hyphae by 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> increases its ability to adhere to the host tissues, increasing its contact surface, leading to a higher propagation and developing of virulence factors (Giolo and Svidzinski 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2010</xref>). Under stress, 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> change from yeast form to hyphae, that it is closely interconnected with its pathogenicity, given that filamentous fungi present better adherence to the tissue since at the end of hyphae, there are enzymes that, when secreted, can degrade proteins, lipids and other components of host cells, facilitating the invasion process (Costa et al.
