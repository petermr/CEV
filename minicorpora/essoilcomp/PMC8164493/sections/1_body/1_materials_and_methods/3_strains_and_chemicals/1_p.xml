<p id="Par9">Evaluation of the intrinsic antimicrobial activity of the EOPC was performed against standard microbial strains 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 25923, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC 25922 and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> ATCC 10231, as well as, against multidrug-resistant strains 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> SA1199B overexpressing the 
 <italic>norA</italic> gene (Kaatz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1993</xref>), 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> K2068 overexpressing the 
 <italic>mepA</italic> gene (Kaatz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2005</xref>) and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> K4100 overexpressing the 
 <italic>qacC</italic> gene (Littlejohn et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1991</xref>). Assays for evaluation of the modulating effect on drug resistance were performed only with drug-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> SA1199B, K2068 and K4100 strains. Assays for evaluation of the ability to inhibit the cellular dimorphism were conducted against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> ATCC 10231 strain. Bacterial and yeast strains were maintained on Brain Heart Infusion Agar (BHIA, Himedia, India) slants at 4 °C, and prior to assay the cells were grown overnight at 37 °C in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI, Himedia, India). Subsequently, an aliquot of each microbial culture was removed and diluted in 3 mL of 0.9% saline, and the turbidity adjusted to the McFarland 0.5 scale.
