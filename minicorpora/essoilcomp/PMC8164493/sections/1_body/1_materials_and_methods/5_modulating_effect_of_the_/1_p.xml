<p id="Par13">To evaluate if the EOPC was able to modulate antibiotic resistance in 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains overexpressing specific efflux pump genes, antibiotic MICs were determined in the presence or absence of subinhibitory concentrations of EOPC (1/8 or 1/4 MICs). Antibiotic concentrations ranged from 0.125 to 128 μg/mL. The microtiter plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and readings were performed with resazurin as described above. To verify whether the modulation of drug resistance occurred due to inhibition of the efflux pump, the modulation assay was performed by substituting antibiotics for EtBr, which is a known substrate of efflux pumps (Markham et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1999</xref>), used herein as inhibition of the pump. Control trials were also performed, replacing each natural product with CPZ, which is a known efflux pump inhibitor (Neyfakh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1993</xref>).
