<p id="Par8">The oil was prepared by hydrodistillation using a Clevenger graduated device. The proportion of fresh leaves was 100 g/L of distilled water, following the methodology described by Wasicky (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">1963</xref>). An electric dryer model—FANEM 320 SE was used, with air circulation at 40º C for 24 h to dry the leaves. Following to determine the moisture content at the time of extraction, samples of 20 g were collected in triplicates, submitted to drying in an electric dryer model FANEM 320 SE with air circulation at 65 °C until reaching constant weight. After extraction, the samples were collected with a precision pipette and placed in a freezer where they remained until the time of the chromatographic analysis.
