<p id="Par14">The tests were performed according to Sidrim and Rocha (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2010</xref>), with some modifications. In this test, the effect of the EOPC on the suppression of the filament of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> was verified. Depleted Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) was placed inside of Falcon tubes and, then the EOPC was added varying the concentration according to MIC as follow: MIC (512 μg/mL), MIC 1/2 (256 μg/mL) and MIC 1/4 (128 μg/mL). Then, PDA was immediately poured in a slide. Petri dishes with a blade were inoculated by a calibrated loop (1 μg), where two parallel streaks were made in the medium already solidified and then covered by a sterile microscopic sheet. After incubation at 24 h (37 °C), the culture was visualized by optical microscopy. A control without the EOPC was made for the growth of yeasts whose hyphae emission was stimulated by the impoverishment of the medium, once stress caused by starvation leads to hyphae emission.
