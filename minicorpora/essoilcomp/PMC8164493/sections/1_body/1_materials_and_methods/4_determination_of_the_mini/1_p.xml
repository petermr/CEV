<p id="Par11">Initially, the essential oil was diluted in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at a concentration of 10,000 µg/mL. Subsequently, this solution was diluted in sterile distilled water to a concentration of 1024 µg/mL. The minimum inhibitory concentration of EOPC against bacteria and fungi strains was determined using the 96-well plate microdilution technique. Initially, 100 µL of essential oil was diluted serially in BHI 10% medium in concentrations that ranged from 1024 to 8 µg/mL. Subsequently, 100 µL of the microbial suspension (bacteria or fungi) in BHI 10% was added. For the control of microbial growth, BHI 10% was composed and microbial suspension in the absence of essential oil (Leal et al.
