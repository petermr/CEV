<p id="Par28">EOPC showed antifungal action and it was able to inhibit the hyphae projection by 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> ATCC 10231, indicating a promise use in the treatment of candidiasis. In addition, the essential oil potentiating the activity of Norfloxacin decreasing its MIC values for resistant strains overexpressing NorA or MepA efflux pumps. Futhermore, EOPC promoted a significant reduction of the MIC values for EtBr indicating that the modulating effect could be related to its ability to cause inhibition of this efflux pumps. These results point to a potential of the EOPC as an adjuvant of Norfloxacin in the treatment of infections caused by 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains overproducing NorA or MepA efflux pumps, a protein overexpressed in 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> SA1199B. Besides NorA and MepA, EOPC was also to act as a QacC efflux pump inhibitor compound indicating a potential technological application in association with quaternary ammonia compounds for elimination of QacC overproducing 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains in both human and veterinary clinical environments.
