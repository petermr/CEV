<p id="Par2">Infectious diseases caused by multidrug-resistant microorganisms has become a global public health concern (Guschin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2015</xref>). Multidrug-resistant bacteria have been isolated with high frequencies from community or hospital-acquired infections (Klein et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2020</xref>; Xiang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2020</xref>), as well as, from infections of veterinary importance (Lima et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2012</xref>). On the other hand, infections caused by resistant fungi are more and more prevalent in hospitals, being known as a sleeping giant, for never having completely solved the problem of ineffective antifungals (Ver√≠ssimo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2016</xref>). In fact, antimicrobial resistance it was predicted to reach pandemic proportions by 2050, accounting for 10 million deaths annually (Sugden et al.
