<p id="Par4">Traditionally used antibiotics have been losing their effectiveness because of increased microbial resistance (Mayers et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2009</xref>). Epidemiological studies warn of the importance of further research for discovery of new drugs or compounds with therapeutic properties (Balouiri et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2016</xref>). Another important point, to combat infections caused by resistant microorganisms, is the discover of compound acting as efflux pump inhibitors to provide new ways to reverse bacterial and fungal resistance (Rezende-JÃºnior et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2020</xref>). In this way, alternative forms such as in vitro methods in antimicrobial tests to assess the potential of extracts, essential oils, and isolated compounds have been intensified, revealing potential antimicrobial agents or even enhancing the activity of antibiotics used in clinical practice (Balouiri et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2016</xref>; Coutinho et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2008</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2010</xref>; Matias et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2013</xref>; Costa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2017</xref>; Siebra et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2018</xref>). The association of natural products as well as the use of these combined with antimicrobials, has been widely discussed in the scientific literature, given the ability to provide antimicrobial efficacy in previously ineffective doses due to the antimicrobial resistance presented by some strains (Guimaraes et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2010</xref>; Silva et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2014</xref>; Tulgar et al.
