<p id="Par3">Antibiotic resistance can acquired by a mutation that generate a change in a target protein with lower for affinity for antibiotic or through acquisition of resistance placed in plasmids, transposons or phage DNA that often involves inactivation, antibiotic degradation or extrusion by active efflux pumps (Santos et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2007</xref>). Efflux pumps are transmembrane proteins that become both bacteria and fungi resistant, because they are able to extrude antibiotics and biocide reducing their intracellular concentrations using ATP or proton gradient as energy source (Du et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2018</xref>).
