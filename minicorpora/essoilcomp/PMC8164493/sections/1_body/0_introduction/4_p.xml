<p id="Par5">The inhibition of the production of virulence factors by pathogenic microorganisms is also an approach that can be useful in the treatment of infectious diseases. 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species, produce infections ranging from skin and mucous infections, to deep and generalized infections, they make use of alternative mechanisms to invade the host organism and develop virulence factors, where they colonize significantly, leaving the responses to aggression, weakened (Egue et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2018</xref>). 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> is the species responsible for about 50–70% of the cases of invasive candidiasis (Castro et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2016</xref>). 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> is a yeast species capable of producing hyphae or pseudo-hyphae able to invade host tissues leading to candidiasis (Fernandes et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2020</xref>; Sellam and Whiteway 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2016</xref>). The ability to alter structural morphology from yeast to filamentous cells, is known as one of the main mechanisms of fungal virulence (Hou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2011</xref>; Sánchez-Martínez and Pérez-Martín 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2001</xref>).
