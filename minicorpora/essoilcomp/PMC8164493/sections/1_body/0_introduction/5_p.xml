 <italic>Piper caldense</italic> C.D.C. (Piperaceae) is a shrub popularly known as “pimenta d’agua” that has been used in some Brazilian regions as a sedative agent (Cardozo Júnior and Chaves 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2003</xref>). This study aimed to characterize the chemical composition of the essential oil from the leaves of 
 <italic>Piper caldense</italic> (EOPC), as well as, its antimicrobial activity against bacteria and yeast strains. The ability of the EOPC to inhibit cell dimorphism in 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> was also assessed. Futhermore, the effect of the EOPC on the activity of Norfloxacin against multidrug-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> SA1199B, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> K2068 and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> K4100 strains was assessed to evaluate its potential as inhibitor of the NorA, MepA or QacC efflux pumps.
