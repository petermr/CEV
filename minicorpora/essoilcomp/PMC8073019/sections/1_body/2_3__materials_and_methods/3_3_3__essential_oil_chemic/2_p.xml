<p>The GC×GC-QMS experiments were conducted on a TRACE 1310 gas chromatograph coupled to a fast-scanning ISQ single transmission quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) (Thermo Scientific—Waltham, MA, USA). The GC was equipped with a split/splitless injector (SSL) (ThermoFisher Scientific—Austin, TX, USA). A Topaz 4.0 mm-id split precision inlet liner (Restek Corporation—Bellefonte, PA, USA) was used for sample vaporization. A TriPlus RSH autosampler (ThermoFisher Scientific) fitted with a 10 µL syringe (Trajan Scientific—San Diego, CA, USA) was used to inject the liquid sample. The rinsing solvents were isopropanol and methylene chloride.</p>
