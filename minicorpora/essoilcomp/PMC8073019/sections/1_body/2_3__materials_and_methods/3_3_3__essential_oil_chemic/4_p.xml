<p>A modulation period of 5 s with a re-injection (flush) pulse of 200 ms was used in all FM-GC×GC analyses. Ultrapure Helium was used as carries gas and auxiliary gas at constant flow rates of 1 mL/min and 20.0 mL/min, respectively. The GC inlet was kept at 250 °C and operated with a split ratio of 1:20. The oven temperature was programed from 60 to 240 °C at 3 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup>. The ion source and MS transfer line were kept at 220 °C and 250 °C, respectively. Electron ionization was performed at 70 eV and 150 µA emission current. The mass range was set from 45 to 400 Da at 42 scans s
