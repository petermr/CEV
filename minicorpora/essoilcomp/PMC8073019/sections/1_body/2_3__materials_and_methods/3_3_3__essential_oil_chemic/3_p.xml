<p>Differential flow modulation was performed in reverse fill/flush (RFF) configuration using the INSIGHT flow modulator (SepSolve Analytical—Waterloo, ON, Canada). ChromSpace software (1.9 version, SepSolve Analytical) was used to control the INSIGHT modulator. Instrument control and data acquisition were performed using Xcalibur software (ThermoFisher Scientific). The column arrangement consisted of two wall-coated open tubular (WCOT) capillary columns. The primary column was a 30 m × 0.25 mm-id × 0.25 μm (β = 250) HP-5MS (Agilent Technologies—Santa Clara, CA, USA). Secondary column was a 5.0 m × 0.25 mm-id × 0.25 μm (β = 250) HP-50+ (Agilent Technologies). A 23 cm × 0.53 mm-id sampling loop of 50 µL (part N. 70058) (Restek Corporation) and a 3.0 m × 0.10 mm-id deactivated fused silica restrictor were used for RFF. An unpurged SilFlow GC 3-port splitter (part N. 123725) (Trajan Scientific) was used for passive division of the secondary column effluent for parallel detection (MS/FID). Two 5.0 m × 0.18 mm-id and 5.0 m × 0.32 mm-id deactivated capillaries (Restek Corporation) were used to connect the three-way splitter to the MS and FID, respectively. A reproducible division of approximately 1:6 was achieved throughout the experiments. The interested reader is directed elsewhere for more details on the instrument setup [
