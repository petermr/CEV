<p>Data processing was performed using GC Image software (2020r1.2 version, Zoex—Houston, TX, USA). Compounds were tentatively identified comparing the substance mass spectra with NIST 14 database (National Institute of Standards—Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and filtered by the retention index (LTPRI), adopting minimum similarity match of 80% from NIST and ± 25 LTPRI deviation as those reported by Adams (2017) [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-02332" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. GC retention index of each compound was calculated based on injection of a homologous series of C

 <sub>20</sub>
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes (Merck-St. Louis, MO, USA) using the Van den Dool and Kratz equation [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-02332" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and the concentration of the metabolites were obtained by area normalization.
