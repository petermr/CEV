<p>In addition, although the species has been extensively a target of scientific studies regarding its chemical composition and evaluation of its biological profiles [

A previous study with the plant by Multidimensional Gas Chromatography (MDGC) showed the evaluation of the enantiomeric ratios of Î±-pinene, sabinene, limonene, and linalool. However, it was described the investigation of only one genotype and the employment of a heart-cut system of the enantiomeric fractions instead of the full sample analysis [
