<p>Previous studies of 
 <italic>L. alba</italic> reported the evaluation of genetic parameters such as performance for environment stability, adaptability, and Genotype Ã— Environment interactions. These studies resulted in a bank of aromas and fragrances with over 100 new combinations of plants belonging to the Agronomic Institute (IAC) in Campinas, Brazil [

 <xref rid="B11-molecules-26-02332" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], affording relevant information that subsequently led to the genetic breeding program from IAC to perform biparental crosses of the most promisor cultivars, aiming to obtain plants with different genetic variability. Hence, crossings between the genotypes linalool, myrcene/camphor, limonene/camphor, and citral resulted in new hybrids with different combinations of major constituents [

 <xref rid="B12-molecules-26-02332" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. As far as we know, it was the first genetic breeding of 
 <italic>L. alba</italic> in Brazil and worldwide. However, none of these materials were evaluated regarding their chemical composition so far.
