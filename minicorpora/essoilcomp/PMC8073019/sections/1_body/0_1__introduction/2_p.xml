 <italic>L. alba</italic> is a plant that presents great agronomic potential, with rapid and aggressive development and easy cultivation [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-26-02332" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. All the features previously mentioned have stood out the species as a promising plant for an economic exploration that might be applied as a natural source with different purposes and in varied fields, such as pharmaceutical, cosmetic, perfumery and agricultural industries [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-02332" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, as higher is the demand of compounds extracted from natural resources, the higher is the over-exploitation of native species that is also threatened by habitat transformation, pollution, and climate changes, endangering the extinction of the same. This is the case of some species of 
 <italic>Lippia</italic> genus from Minas Gerais and Goias states (Cadeia do Espinha√ßo region) in Brazil, that are at risk of extinction due the vulnerability of that region [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-26-02332" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Hence, to reach the sustainable cultivation of species with economic potential, genetic resources maintained in germplasm banks have been established as a fundamental role for biodiversity conservation and to provide genetic diversity [

 <xref rid="B9-molecules-26-02332" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition, studies of genetic breeding programs are important for the standardization of the chemical phenotype and can be used to select the well adapted and potential genotypes of the existing germplasm, improving quality and productivity as well as developing varieties with enhanced value to the market [

 <xref rid="B10-molecules-26-02332" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These researches become a powerful complement to fulfill the worldwide demand for quality products besides being a strategic tool for the development of new raw materials for industrial use (pharmaceutical, perfumery, and beverages) [
