<p>Thus, the objective of this work was to perform the chemical characterization of new genotypes combinations obtained from biparental crosses of 
 <italic>L. alba</italic> by flow-modulated GC×GC-MS (FM-GC×GC-MS) combined to multivariate data analyses using principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). This is the first investigation of 
 <italic>Lippia</italic> species employing this modern technique. This study aims to contribute for a well understanding of these new plant crossings that might represent materials with highlighted agronomic value, as well as driving future genetic breeding studies and consequently obtention of different combinations of chemical phenotype for a future industrial applicability.
