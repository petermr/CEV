<p>In order to investigate the similarity and relationship among the EOs chemical composition of 
 <italic>L. alba</italic> genotypes, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA) were constructed to the oil components. From the HCA analysis, it was observed a separation among the samples, which the X(2) and X6M13 genotypes (group I) were the most dissimilar, followed by the X10M37 genotype (group II). The remaining genotypes (X6M6, X6M9, X6M15, and X6MIA, group III) showed a greater chemical similarity to each other.
