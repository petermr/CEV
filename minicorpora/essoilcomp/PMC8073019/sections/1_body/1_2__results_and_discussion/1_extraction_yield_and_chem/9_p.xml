<p>Although major constituents present in the genotypes might be effective to drive a future biological application of the samples, it should be noted that different ratios of these components can affect the final behavior of the same. In addition, a deeper investigation and knowledge of other minor constituents are pivotal since synergistic or antagonistic effects might influence the overall performance [

In addition, it is also relevant the evaluation of possible co-eluted components in the samples for their chemical composition discrimination. Hence, the analyses of the GC×GC-MS allowed to verify the presence of co-eluted compounds in five genotypes. Whereas the coelution of humulene epoxide II with a second unknown compound
