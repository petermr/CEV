<p>The analysis of the essential oil chemical composition from eight genotypes of 
 <italic>L. alba</italic> allowed the identification of 73 secondary metabolites, as disclosed in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02332-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. In general, the constituents identified in oils belong to the terpenoids class, with the following predominance: monoterpene hydrocarbons (1.53–59.79%) and oxygenated monoterpenes (9.99–86.44%), sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (3.07–30.49%), and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (3.96–19.49%), from which α-pinene, β-myrcene, 1,8-cineole, linalool, citral (neral + geranial), and caryophyllene oxide were the most abundant compounds among the accessions, enabling the separation of the genotypes into different chemotypes of 
 <italic>L. alba</italic>

 <italic>trans</italic>-verbenol, myrtenol, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene, α-guaiene, germacrene D, and α-bulnesene in relevant quantities in some of the genotypes, as disclosed in
