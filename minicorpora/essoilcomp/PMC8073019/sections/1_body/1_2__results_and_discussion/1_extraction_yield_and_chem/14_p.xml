<p>These analyses allowed to distinguish the samples in four main groups: (X(2) and X6M13, group I), (X10M37, group II), (X6M15 and X2M1, group III), and (X6M6, X6M9, and X6MIA, group IV). This classification had been previously supported by the dendrogram from the HCA analysis, mainly allowing the distinction of the groups I and II.</p>
