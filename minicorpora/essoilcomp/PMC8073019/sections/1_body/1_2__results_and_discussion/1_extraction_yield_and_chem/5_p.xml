<p>The essential oil of the X6M13 genotype in addition to β-myrcene also showed a high abundance of α-pinene (31.59% and 19.69%, respectively, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02332-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Usually, the abundance of α-pinene in 
 <italic>L. alba</italic> essential oils, when reported, is extremely low, reaching less than 1.0% [

However, further seasonality investigations are still needed to confirm this chemotype. α-pinene is a colorless and water-insoluble volatile plant metabolite, found in many essential oils and being the major monoterpene of pine trees. As a safe food additive approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, this compound has been widely used as a food-flavoring ingredient [
