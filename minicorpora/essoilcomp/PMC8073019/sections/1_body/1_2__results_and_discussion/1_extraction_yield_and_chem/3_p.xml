<p>The essential oil of the X2M1 genotype showed the highest abundance of β-myrcene (51.11%), also observed to the genotypes X6M6 (34.50%) and X6M13 (31.59%,

 <xref rid="B34-molecules-26-02332" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], which one among the sixteen analyzed chemotypes revealed the abundance of 47.60% of β-myrcene. Additionally, our findings are also comparable to those matrices already known of having higher quantities of this compound, as, e.g., in hops essential oils. Studies of the essential oils of hop Polish cultivars afforded from 29.90 to 67.00% of this monoterpene [
