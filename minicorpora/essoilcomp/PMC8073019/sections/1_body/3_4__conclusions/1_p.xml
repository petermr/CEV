<p>In this work, the chemical characterization of eight essential oils from new 
 <italic>L. alba</italic> genotypes was performed by GC×GC-MS combined to multivariate data analyses. From this investigation, the new genotypes could be distinguished in four main groups according to the variance observed through the PCA analysis, indicating a variation in their chemical composition. Higher amount of β-myrcene was observed to the X2M1 genotype, indicating this accession as a natural source to obtain this compound. In addition, higher amounts of sesquiterpenes were observed in the genotypes X2M1 and X6M15. This is the first report disclosing α-pinene in higher amounts in 
 <italic>L. alba</italic> (19.69%, X6M13 genotype), suggesting the existence of a new α-pinene/myrcene chemotype. The use of GC×GC-MS for 
 <italic>L. alba</italic> essentials oils was reported in this work by the first time, allowing the identification of 73 metabolites in the accessions, and the technique was also efficient to identify compounds in low abundance, which 26 compounds were identified in concentrations up to 0.1% in at least one of the eight analyzed genotypes. Furthermore, the compounds myrtenal and myrtenol could be well separated through the second dimension, whereas humulene epoxide II could be identified and well separated from a second unknown compound. The results found in this work contributed to the understanding of the chemical composition of new 
 <italic>L. alba</italic> genotypes and highlight the relevance of these materials as natural sources for a future flavor, fragrance, and pharmaceutical applicability. In addition, this work also emphasizes the relevance of genetic breeding studies to potentially improve the essential oils quality and obtention of different combinations of chemical phenotype.
