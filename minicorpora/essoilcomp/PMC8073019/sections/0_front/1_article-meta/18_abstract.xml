  <italic>Lippia alba</italic> (Mill.) N. E. Br. (Verbenaceae) is an aromatic shrub whose essential oils have stood out as a promising source for application in several industrial fields. In this study, the essential oils chemical characterization of eight new 
  <italic>L. alba</italic> genotypes was performed. The selected materials were collected from the Active Germplasm Bank of the Agronomic Institute and the essential oils were extracted by hydrodistillation. Flow-modulated comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC×GC-MS) was employed for chemical characterization and evaluation of possible co-eluted compounds. In addition, the chemical analyses were submitted to multivariate statistical analyses. From this investigation, 73 metabolites were identified in the essential oils of the genotypes, from which α-pinene, β-myrcene, 1,8-cineole, linalool, neral, geranial, and caryophyllene oxide were the most abundant compounds among the accessions. This is the first report disclosing α-pinene in higher amounts in 
  <italic>L. alba</italic> (19.69%). In addition, sabinene, 
  <italic>trans</italic>-verbenol, myrtenol, (
  <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene, α-guaiene, germacrene D, and α-bulnesene were also found in relevant quantities in some of the genotypes, and myrtenal and myrtenol could be well separated through the second dimension. Such results contributed to the understanding of the chemical composition of those new genotypes, being important to drive a future industrial applicability and studies in genetic breeding.
