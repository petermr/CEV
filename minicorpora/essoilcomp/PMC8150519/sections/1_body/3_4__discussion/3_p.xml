<p>Several products based on thymol are already commercially available against the ectoparasite mite 
 <italic>Varroa destructor</italic> and are used inside hives [
 <xref rid="B39-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. An important advantage of beehive treatments with thymol is that no maximum residue limit in honey is imposed for this compound and no mite resistance against it has been found yet [
 <xref rid="B39-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Furthermore, as it is highly volatile and apolar, thymol has a low persistence in honey compared to wax [
 <xref rid="B39-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, in bee wax, thymol residues can persist for several months [
 <xref rid="B40-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In addition, thymol has negative effects on colony expansion, as it reduces the bee brood [
 <xref rid="B39-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and can affect phototaxis in treated bees but has no effects on colony mortality [
 <xref rid="B41-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].
