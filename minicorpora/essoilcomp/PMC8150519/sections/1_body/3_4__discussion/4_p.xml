<p>Our results confirm the excellent antimicrobic properties of 
 <italic>Cinnamomum</italic> oil, already successfully applied in vitro and in vivo against 
 <italic>Paenibacillus larvae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B35-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], the ethiological agent of the american foulbrood, and against 
 <italic>A. apis</italic> using both contact-dependent and contact-independent methods [
 <xref rid="B30-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. E-cinnamaldehyde was the major component present in the 
 <italic>Cinnamomum</italic> oil used in our bioassays (79.3%). In addition to both thymol and carvacrol, E-cinnamaldehyde and other compounds (citral, citronellal, geraniol, eugenol and borneol) have been reported to have significant inhibitory effects on fungal growth [
 <xref rid="B22-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,

 <xref rid="B45-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Because honey bees produce secretions containing geraniol, citral, geranic and nerolic acids through the Nasonov glands, the use of these natural substances that are already present in the nest may not disturb the colony [
 <xref rid="B46-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Moreover, many of these volatile and extractable compounds detected in the analyzed essential oils can be found in wax [
 <xref rid="B49-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], honey [
 <xref rid="B50-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and in resins collected from plants and used to produce propolis by bees [
 <xref rid="B51-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="B52-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Therefore, it is plausible to expect an endogenous inhibitory action of all these compounds characteristic of the hive environment on this pathogen. In support of this hypothesis, we know that the presence of some pathogens and/or parasites, including 
 <italic>A. apis</italic>, in the hive triggers an increase in the resin collection by foragers [
 <xref rid="B53-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="B54-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. However, toxicological studies on the lethal or sublethal effects of essential oils on treated bees are very few. The studies by Eguaras et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and Ruffinengo et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] did not show toxicity (mortality) in bees treated with 
 <italic>Tagetes minuta</italic> and 
 <italic>Cinnamomun</italic> oils, respectively. These results are encouraging and future studies on the application and effects of these essential oils in apiaries are needed.
