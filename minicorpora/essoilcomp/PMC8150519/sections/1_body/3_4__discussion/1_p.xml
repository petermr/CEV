<p>Among the various essential oils tested in this study, mostly from Mediterranean aromatic plants, the main finding was the higher efficacy of 
 <italic>Thymus capitatus</italic>, 
 <italic>Thymus herba-barona</italic>, 
 <italic>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic> and 
 <italic>Helichrysum italicum</italic> oils compared to nystatin, a common antimycotic drug. Furthermore, 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic>, 
 <italic>T. herba-barona</italic> and 
 <italic>T. capitata</italic> oils displayed the best fungicidal and sporicidal action, and their potential use in controlling infection in apiaries should be taken into consideration. Although previous in vitro studies have focused mainly on the fungicidal and non-sporicidal effects of essential oils, the observed sporicidal effect is very important because it suggests that some oils could be employed in the disinfection of combs or beekeeping equipment.
