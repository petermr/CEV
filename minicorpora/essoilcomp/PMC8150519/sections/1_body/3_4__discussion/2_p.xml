<p>The antifungal activity of the 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> essential oil against 
 <italic>A. apis</italic> was tested in previous studies using the agar dilution method [
 <xref rid="B28-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Subsequently, 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> was confirmed to be a strong inhibitor of mycelium growth in the vapor phase as well [
 <xref rid="B12-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This bioactivity is attributable to two phenolic monoterpenes, thymol and carvacrol, which are major bioactive components of 
 <italic>Thymus</italic> oil [
 <xref rid="B31-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This was confirmed in our bioassays, where carvacrol was identified as the major component of 
 <italic>Thymus capitatus</italic> oil (68%) and 
 <italic>Thymus herba-barona</italic> oil (60%), although thymol was present in small amounts.
