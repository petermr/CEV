<p>In conclusion, our in vitro study showed promising results regarding the use of essential oils from Mediterranean garrigue plants, especially 
 <italic>T. herba-barona</italic> and 
 <italic>T. capitata,</italic> and commercial 
 <italic>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic> oil in the control of 
 <italic>Ascosphaera apis</italic>. The advantages and disadvantages of the potential use of essential oils were also analyzed, and these require further elucidation. Therefore, it would be useful to conduct in vivo experiments in order to perform an in-depth evaluation of the effects of these oils on bees and on bee product residues.
