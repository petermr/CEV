<p>Among the 10 pure essential oils tested against 
 <italic>A. apis</italic> using the PDD method, the most effective were 
 <italic>T. herba-barona</italic> and 
 <italic>T. capitatus</italic>, which fully blocked the growth of the fungus (
 <xref rid="vetsci-08-00080-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). On average, the essential oils from 
 <italic>H. italicum</italic> and 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> produced an inhibition halo of 40.0 and 24.8 mm, respectively (
 <xref rid="vetsci-08-00080-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). A lower inhibiting effect was observed for the oils from 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> (commercial and non-commercial), 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic> and 
 <italic>M. communis</italic> plants, which showed an inhibition halo smaller than 16 mm. 
 <italic>S. desoleana</italic> and 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> did not show any antimicrobial activity, as observed in the control plate. Nystatin showed a mean inhibition diameter of 17.0 mm, similar to the commercial 
 <italic>Rosmarinus</italic> and lower than 
 <italic>Thymus</italic>, 
 <italic>Helichrysum</italic> and 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> (
