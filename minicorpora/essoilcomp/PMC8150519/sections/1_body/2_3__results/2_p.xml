<p>Based on the agar diffusion results, in which pure essential oils were employed, the microdilution assay and characterization analysis were conducted only on the four essential oils that showed the highest activity (inhibition halo diameters larger than 20 mm). The assays on the vegetative forms performed in Sabouraud broth showed an inhibitory effect (MIC) on the growth of 
 <italic>A. apis</italic> at 100 ppm for 
 <italic>T. capitatus</italic> and 
 <italic>T. herba-barona</italic> oils and 200 ppm for 
 <italic>Cinnamomum</italic> oil, whereas 
 <italic>Helichrysum</italic> did not show any inhibitory activity even at the highest concentration (500 ppm) (

 <italic>Cinnamomum</italic> essential oil showed an MFC at 200 ppm, whereas both thyme oils demonstrated an MFC at 300 ppm (

 <italic>Helichrysum</italic> essential oil did not show any inhibition activity at any of the concentrations tested in this type of assay (
 <xref rid="vetsci-08-00080-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The inhibitory test carried out on the 
 <italic>A. apis</italic> spores showed an overall high resistance of these forms to the essential oils. Only MSC values of 400 ppm showed a sporicidal effect for both 
 <italic>Thymus</italic> oils and the 
 <italic>Cinnamomum</italic> oil, whereas 
 <italic>Helichrysum</italic> required an MSC of 500 ppm (
 <xref rid="vetsci-08-00080-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In all bioassays performed, we observed a regular growth of the fungus 
 <italic>A. apis</italic> in the control treatment.
