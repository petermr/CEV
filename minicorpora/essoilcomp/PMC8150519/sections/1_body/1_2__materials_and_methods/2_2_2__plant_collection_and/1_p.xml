Flowering tops and stems of each of the eight species were collected from the plants at sunrise, stored immediately at a temperature below 24 °C and brought to the laboratory within 6 h after harvest for analysis. The distillation process was performed on homogeneous samples (same weight), without any pre-processing, in a 50-L steel steam distiller (Albrigi-Stallavena, Verona, Italy) with a recycling system for about 2 h. At the end of distillation, the EOs, separated from water by decantation, were recovered directly from the distillate and dried over anhydrous Na
