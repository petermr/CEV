<p>The reference strain 
 <italic>Ascosphaera apis</italic> 3116 used in this study was provided by the DMSZ collection (German Collection of Microorganism and Cell Cultures GmbH). The strain was stored at 4 °C until microbiological tests. Fresh culture of 
 <italic>A. apis</italic> was obtained by growing the fungus on a Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA; Oxoid, Milan, Italy) at 30 °C for 5 days in aerobic conditions, used as a stock plate. Fungal spores were obtained by exposing 
 <italic>A. apis</italic> culture in Sabouraud dextrose broth (SDB) at a high level of CO
 <sub>2</sub> and at 37 °C for 4 h and then at 20 °C for 72 h. After microscopic enumeration with a cell-counting hemocytometer (Neubauer chamber; Merck, Milan, Italy), the spore concentration was adjusted to about 1×10
 <sup>5</sup> spores/mL before final inoculation.
