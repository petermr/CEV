<p>Briefly, MIC determination was performed on a 96-well microtiter plate (Merk, Milan, Italy) containing SDB medium. The EOs were first diluted to obtain the highest concentration of 500 ppm, which was further diluted to obtain the following concentrations: 400, 300, 200, 100 and 50 ppm. The highest oil concentration used in our bioassays was based on previous tests evaluating the possible side effects of these oils on adult bees [

Each well was inoculated with a fungal suspension (obtained as described above) in such a volume as to obtain a concentration of about 106 CFU/mL. Then, the microplates were kept at 30 Â°C for 5 days. The lowest concentration of the EOs in which there was no visible growth (i.e., the absence of turbidity in the well) was taken as the MIC [
