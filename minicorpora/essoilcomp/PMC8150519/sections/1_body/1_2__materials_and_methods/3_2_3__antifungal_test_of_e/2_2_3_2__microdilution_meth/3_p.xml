<p>Furthermore, in order to establish the MFC, the subcultures taken from the MIC wells where no visible growth was recorded were streaked on an SDA plate. After incubation at 30 °C for 5 days in aerobic conditions, the fungal viable growth was evaluated. The lowest concentration of the EOs in which there was no fungal growth was taken as the MFC. Finally, to evaluate the minimum sporicidal concentration (MSC), the same method was used; the microplates containing the EOs at different concentrations were inoculated with an aliquot of the fungal spores’ culture (described above) and incubated at 30 °C for 5 days. An aliquot from the well, in which there was no visible growth, was taken and inoculated on an SDA plate. After incubation time, the lowest concentration of the EOs in which there was no viable growth on the SDA plate was taken as the MSC. All trials were made with three replications for each EO tested. Because the results were homogeneous in all three replicates, the values of MIC, MFC and MSC were reported in the table without a measure of variability. SDB medium without essential oils was used as a control.</p>
