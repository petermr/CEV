<p>A first screening to establish the susceptibility of 
 <italic>A. apis</italic> to EOs was carried out using the paper disc agar diffusion (PDD) method. From an SDA agar plate, a mycelium disc of 6 mm in diameter was taken, dissolved in Ringer solution (Oxoid) and vortexed for 5 min. Subsequently, 1 mL of the fungal suspension was overlaid on the SDA plate. After plate solidification, sterile filter paper discs (6 mm in diameter, Oxoid, Milan, Italy), saturated with each pure essential oil (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10), were placed over the plate surface (PDD method). The cultures were then incubated at 30 Â°C for 5 days. Blank discs and synthetic antifungal nystatin were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. The diameter (mm) of fungal growth inhibition was measured (disk diameter included). An EO activity level higher than 20 mm was classified as high activity. All the experiments were carried out in triplicate for each essential oil.
