<p>The chemical composition of the oils was assessed using a gas chromatography–flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. An HROC 5300 Mega series gas-chromatograph, coupled with an FID (Carlo Erba, Milan, Italy), was used for quantitative analysis, whereas a Hewlett Packard 5890 series II gas-chromatograph (Hewlett Packard, Avondale, PA), equipped with a HP 5971 A (70 eV) mass selective detector (MSD) in manual injection mode, a split-splitless injector and an MS ChemStation HP v. C.00.07, was used for peak identification and confirmation. The column was a fused silica capillary DB-5MS (5% phenylmethylpolysiloxane, 30 m × 0.25 mm id, 0.25 µm film thickness) (J&amp;W Scientific Fisons, Folsom, CA, USA). The injector and the interface were operated at 200 °C and 280 °C, respectively. The oven temperature was programmed as follows: from 60 °C to 180 °C (3 °C/min) and isothermally held for 15 min. Helium was the carrier gas at 0.9 mL/min, and the sample (1 µL) was injected in split mode (1:20). MS conditions were as follows: ionization voltage, 70 eV; scan rate, 1.6 scan/s; mass range, 40–500; and ion source temperature, 180 °C. The identification of the essential oil compounds was based on comparison of the retention times with those of authentic samples, comparing their linear retention index (LRI) relative to the series of n-hydrocarbons, and on computer matching against mass spectrum commercial libraries (NIST 98 and ADAMS) and a homemade library built up from pure substances and components of known oils and MS literature data.</p>
