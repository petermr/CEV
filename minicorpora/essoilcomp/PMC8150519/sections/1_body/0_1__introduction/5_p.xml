<p>Essential oils are hydrophobic liquids containing bioactive volatile compounds with high chemical variability [
 <xref rid="B32-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], which complicates the study of their pharmacological power. In this work, we evaluated the in vitro activity of 10 essential oils from aromatic plants, most of them typical of the Mediterranean region, against 
 <italic>A. apis</italic>, using the agar diffusion method. In addition, bioassays were performed to assess the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), the minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) and the minimum sporicidal concentration (MSC) values (ppm) of the four essential oils, which showed inhibition haloes greater than that of nystatin (the positive control). They were also chemically characterized by means of gas chromatography–flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis (GC-MS).
