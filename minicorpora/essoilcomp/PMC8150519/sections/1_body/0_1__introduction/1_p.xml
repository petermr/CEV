<p>All the identified species of fungi belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Ascosphaera</italic> (Ascomycota: Plectomycetes; Ascosphaearales) have been detected in bees [
 <xref rid="B1-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The fungus 
 <italic>Ascosphaera apis</italic> (Maassen ex Claussen) Olive and Spiltoir is the etiological agent of the invasive honey bee mycosis named chalkbrood [
 <xref rid="B3-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It is a heterothallic organism that sporulates when mycelia of two different strains of the opposite sex touch each other and fruiting bodies are formed [
 <xref rid="B4-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The disease transmission occurs through the ingestion of spores from contaminated food by the young bee larvae [
 <xref rid="B5-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. After infection, the larvae reduce their food consumption quickly until they stop eating [
 <xref rid="B5-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Bee larvae in the fifth instar are the most sensitive to the disease, as they have favorable environmental conditions in their gut for spore germination [
 <xref rid="B6-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Once in the larval gut, the spores are activated by CO
 <sub>2</sub> obtained from the cells [
 <xref rid="B9-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Then, they can germinate in the lumen, producing a mycelium which pierces the larval cuticle [
 <xref rid="B9-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In this phase, the larvae look like tiny pieces of chalk or “mummies”, which gives the name of chalkbrood to the disease [
 <xref rid="B7-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. As the disease progresses, the larvae become mummified, changing from white to a dark gray or black color due to the presence of spores on the larval cuticle [
 <xref rid="B10-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].
