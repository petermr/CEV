<p>This fungal disease occurs widely in temperate regions and is most prevalent in the spring when there is an increase in the brood in the hive [
 <xref rid="B12-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Fungal spores confined in wax and food stored inside the beehive are very resistant and remain infective for many years, providing a continuous source of infection [

 <xref rid="B11-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The spread of 
 <italic>A. apis</italic> infection in apiary can also be facilitated by its interaction with other pathogens or parasites such as the ectoparasite 
 <italic>Varroa destructor</italic> [

 <xref rid="B14-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In fact, the body surface of mites can become contaminated with fungal spores [

 <xref rid="B16-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], but doubts remain as to whether these can cause infection, since many spores would be required to contaminate the larval food and be ingested by the developing honey bee brood. This would preclude effective direct transmission of 
 <italic>A. apis</italic> by mites. In addition, other factors, such as the genetic strain of the pathogen or the host, can influence the incidence and severity of the disease [
 <xref rid="B17-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Although chalkbrood rarely leads to the collapse of the colonies, it can weaken the hives, with a consequent reduction in honey production and considerable economic losses [
 <xref rid="B18-vetsci-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The incidence of chalkbrood may be on the rise around the world [
