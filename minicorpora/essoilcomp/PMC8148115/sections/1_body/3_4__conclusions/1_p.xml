<p>It is concluded that natural oils have great potential to be used for the effective and sustainable management of TSSM in greenhouses within organic farming. Chemical acaricides can be substituted with natural oil, particularly JEO, because of their human safety and eco-friendly properties. Besides the efficiency of natural oils application in TSSM management, it provided some biostimulation on the growth and yield, as well as biochemical attributes of eggplant under greenhouse conditions within organic systems. Yet, extra research is needed to examine the full biochemical and molecular features of natural oil impacts on crop productivity.</p>
