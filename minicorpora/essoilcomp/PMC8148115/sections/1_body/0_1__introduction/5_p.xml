<p>Although the acaricidal properties of many essential or fixed oils have been studied against TSSM, not much work has been done on lavender (
 <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic> L.), jasmine (
 <italic>Jasminum grandiflorum</italic> L.), and mustard (
 <italic>Brassica juncea</italic> L.) oil against TSSM; additionally, from the current survey, there are no reports on the effect of natural oils on eggplant development and productivity. Therefore, the current study aimed to evaluate the acaricidal activity of EO or FO against TSSM, and their potential as a bio-rational alternative to control that pest under greenhouse conditions, and tested their impacts on eggplant productivity.
