<p>Natural-based insecticides have been introduced as prospective choices for arthropod management, since they represent a possible supply of bioactive secondary metabolites that have been perceived by the public as comparatively harmless and cause fewer threats to the environment, with negligible effects on human health [

Studies have demonstrated that natural oils (essential and fixed oils) are safe, precise in action, eco-friendly, and potentially appropriate for utilizing within integrated pest management programs all over the world within the organic system [
