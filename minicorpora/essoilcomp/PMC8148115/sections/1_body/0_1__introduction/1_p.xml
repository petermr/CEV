<p>The two-spotted spider mite (TSSM), 
 <italic>Tetranychusurticae</italic> Koch (Acarina: Tetranychidae) represents a highly cosmopolitan and polyphagous pest worldwide in protected and open field conditions [
 <xref rid="B1-biology-10-00410" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It predominantly prevails in exhaustive high-yield cropping systems, resulting in a serious economic yield loss (50–100%) in severe infestation conditions [

 <xref rid="B3-biology-10-00410" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. TSSM in the motile stage normally sucks the sap from the lower leaves’ epidermis, which invokes yellowing and discoloration [

 <xref rid="B5-biology-10-00410" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Moreover, severe TSSM invasion induces secondary infestation by fungi, bacteria, and viruses that frequently cause considerable extra injury; additionally, TSSM occurrences induce an allergic syndrome in greenhouse employees [

 <xref rid="B8-biology-10-00410" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Consequently, the extension of the chemical acaricide utilized in TSSM control can comprise the commercialization of agricultural systems and induces harmful impacts to the environment and human health, as well as non-target organisms [
 <xref rid="B9-biology-10-00410" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition, the ecological crisis attributable to the application of acaricides has been an issue of concern in modern decades. It has been estimated that nearly 2.5 million tons of pesticides are utilized in agricultural production yearly, and the global injury evoked by pesticides achieves $100 billion yearly. It is, therefore, hoped that natural oils can offer alternative options to synthesis acaricides and contribute to pesticide resistance [
