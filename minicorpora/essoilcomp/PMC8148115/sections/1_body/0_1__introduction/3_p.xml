<p>Essential oils (EO) have obtained a lot of awareness as practical bioactive products, principally in pesticide terms [

 <xref rid="B19-biology-10-00410" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The acaricidal action of EO is largely unknown, owing to the complexity of the bioactive substances [
 <xref rid="B20-biology-10-00410" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The acaricidal activity of EO in direct contact has been tested and fumigant trials have been conducted [

 <xref rid="B23-biology-10-00410" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Some studies have attempted to determine the mode of action of EO and their constituents on arthropods [

 <xref rid="B25-biology-10-00410" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The acaricidal properties of EOs may result from more than one mode of action due to the diversity of terpenes and terpenoids or other secondary metabolites that were neuro-insecticides or were species-dependent regarding efficacy; those that showed synergistic efficacy when used in combination, with an octopaminergic system, can mediate the insecticidal activity [
