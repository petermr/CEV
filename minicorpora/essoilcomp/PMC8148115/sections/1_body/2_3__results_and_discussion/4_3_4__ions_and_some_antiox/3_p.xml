<p>The application of both EO and FO increased antioxidant compounds such as ascorbic acid and phenols, which offset the destructive impacts of the free radical oxygen on the plants. The total phenolic concentration in the EO- and FO-treated plants was greater than in control plants. This accretion may be attributable to the induction of phenylamino lyase (PAL) gene expression and assimilation of phenolics as well as due to an increase in nitrogen content that is induced by the accumulation of phenols [

Of the plant antioxidants, ascorbic acid represents the most copious and has various biochemical functions, being a substance for ascorbate peroxidase as well as straight nullifying free radicals, and thus, functions as an anti-herbivory agent [
