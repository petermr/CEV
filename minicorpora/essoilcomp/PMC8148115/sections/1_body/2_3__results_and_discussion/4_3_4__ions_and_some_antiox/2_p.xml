<p>The present outcomes and a few earlier reports designate that spraying of natural oils considerably improved the percentage of N, P, and K in plant tissues relative to untreated plants [

 <xref rid="B63-biology-10-00410" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. This increment could be due to superior root development and elevated root dry matter accumulation as well as sustaining plasma membranes function through the enhancement of the antioxidant capacity after the application of natural oils [

 <xref rid="B52-biology-10-00410" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] established that the transcriptional regulatory network regulates the architecture of the plant root system. Additionally, natural oils application possibly has resulted in superior liberate rates of the proton, organic acids, and natural chelators or to a smaller degree by changing the redox perspective of the soil [
