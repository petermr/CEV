<p>There is little information about the effect of natural oils on plant growth improvement [
 <xref rid="B16-biology-10-00410" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The current outcomes proved that eggplant growth was encouragement by foliar application of either EO or FO. The stimulation effect of natural oils on plant growth may be associated with (1) enhancing the antioxidant ability and sustaining plant homeostasis [
 <xref rid="B50-biology-10-00410" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], where the antioxidant capacity of natural oils resulted from its internal antioxidant compounds such as flavonoids and tocopherol; (2) increasing the auxin transport as well as controlling the oxidation of indole-3-acetic acid resulted in the accumulation of auxin needed for cell differentiation and an increase in biomass production [
