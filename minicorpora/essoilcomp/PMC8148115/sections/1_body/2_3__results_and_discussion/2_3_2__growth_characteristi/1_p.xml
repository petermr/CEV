<p>Data presented in 
 <xref rid="biology-10-00410-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> show that foliar spraying of EO or FO significantly increased all growth trails relative to untreated control plants. The greatest values of growth parameters were obtained due to spraying with JEO, which increased plant height, branches, and leaf numbers per plant, as well as the area and relative leaf dry mass of the 3rdâ€“5th leaves by 97%, 46%, 37%, 100%, and 38%, respectively, compared to control plants. The data also indicate that spraying of MFO was more effective than LEO in the improvement of growth trials of eggplant.
