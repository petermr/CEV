<p>Data presented in 
 <xref rid="biology-10-00410-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> show that the changes in TSSM mobile stages population on eggplant as well as the acaricidal effect of studied natural oils. The mean number of TSSM mobile phases ranged between 84â€“426 per leaf. Application of JEO, LEO, or MFO significantly decreased the TSSM population relative to the pre-count or untreated plants after 1 and 10 DPI. The most effective treatment in this regard was JEO followed by MFO and LEO compared with control. Additionally, the data prove that double spray treatment markedly decreased TSSM mobile stages population to the least level compared to the single spray treatment. The current outcomes showed that the entire natural oils spraying showed efficiency in the control of TSSM to a different degree; the most effective was JEO, which showed higher efficiency and the greatest reduction rates relative to LEO, MFO, or untreated plants. Spraying JEO provides the highest reduction rate (49.03%) in TSSM and high efficiency (68.50%) compared to the other natural oils and control.
