<p>Control of TSSM is notoriously difficult, and overall, pesticides are the primary control method; however, they induce detrimental side impacts, i.e., the loss of non-target biota, the occurrence of pesticide-resistant populations and residue concerns, and an outbreak of secondary pests, pest resurgence, and dermal toxicity to the labors exposed in the field [
 <xref rid="B35-biology-10-00410" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Unfortunately, TSSM has been resistant to most available pesticides and the loss of acaricidal efficiency as a result of resistant mite populations is the major problem encountered [

 <xref rid="B36-biology-10-00410" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The current results and a few reports demonstrated that essential oil (EO)- and fixed oil (FO)-based acaricides can prove as efficient as predictable chemical insecticides alongside soft-bodied pests, including TSSM [
