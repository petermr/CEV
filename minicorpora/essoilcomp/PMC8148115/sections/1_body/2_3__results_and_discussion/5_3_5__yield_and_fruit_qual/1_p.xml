<p>Data in 
 <xref rid="biology-10-00410-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> show that exogenous application of JEO, LEO, and MFO markedly increased yield components of eggplant relative to untreated control plants. The greatest fruit number/plant (16.6), fruit length (16.4 cm), fruit diameter (11.6cm), fruit weight/plant (343.3 g), and fruit yield/plant (5910 g) were recorded within the application of JEO with the increasing percentage of 18, 28, 51, 147, and 74% above control plants. The data also proved that MFO was more effective than LEO in increasing eggplant yield. Regarding fruit, yield/plant application of either JEO or MFO significantly increased it, while spraying with LEO non-significantly increased it compared to control plants (
