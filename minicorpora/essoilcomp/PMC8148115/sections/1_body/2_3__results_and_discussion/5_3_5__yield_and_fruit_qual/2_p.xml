<p>As regards fruit quality, data in 
 <xref rid="biology-10-00410-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> indicate that the application of natural oils (EO or FO) significantly increased both the percentage of nitrogen and protein in the fruit compared to control plants. The highest percentage of N (3.45%) and protein (21.59%) was obtained within the JEO application. Regarding the phosphorous, the application of MFO or LEO significantly increased its concentration, while JEO decreased it relative to control. On the other hand, the highest percentage of K was recorded with LEO application relative to other oils or control. The application of either EO or FO significantly increased the soluble phenol and ascorbic acid concentration as well as the percentage of TSS, compared with control, and the greatest concentration was obtained with JEO spraying, which increased it by 45, 17, and 36% relative to untreated control plants. The data also proved that the application of EO or FO significantly decreased total acidity. The most effective in this regard was JEO.
