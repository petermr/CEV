<p>As for vitamin C, the results indicated that foliar spray with EO or FO significantly increased fruit vitamin C content when compared with the control. Fatemi et al. [
 <xref rid="B76-biology-10-00410" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] reported that thyme (
 <italic>Thymus capitates</italic> L.) and peppermint (
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> L.) oil seriously preserved the quantity of vitamin C and sustained the quality of the 
 <italic>Valencia</italic> orange fruit. Similarly, Zeng et al. [
 <xref rid="B77-biology-10-00410" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] and Mohamed and EL-Badawy [
 <xref rid="B78-biology-10-00410" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] reported that some essential oils, such as thyme and clove oils, were effective in maintaining the ascorbic acid of orange fruits. Likewise, Abd Elwahab [
 <xref rid="B69-biology-10-00410" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] stated that the highest content of vitamin C was obtained from nectarine fruits treated with essential oils compared to control fruits. The author explained that the greatest preservation of vitamin C was recorded with essential oil treatments since these treatments decreased the oxidation in the fruits, as the key substances of oils had antioxidant properties that prevented the oxidation of ascorbic acid.
