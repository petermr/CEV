<p>Commonly, yield components were increased by natural oil application. These results agreed with the finding of Ibtesam Badawy et al. [
 <xref rid="B67-biology-10-00410" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] for EO and Dayeswari et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-biology-10-00410" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] for FO; they recorded the encouragement effects on the yield of different crops. The increase in yield by natural oils may be attributable to their function in motivating the physio-biochemical pathways that reflected the improvement of plant development (

 <xref rid="B12-biology-10-00410" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] established that spraying of EO significantly increased Washington navel orange fruit dimension (length and diameter), fruit weight vitamin C content, and TSS when compared to the control. The main causes of the positive effects of natural oils on crop yield might have resulted from the formation of a slim layer of oils over the fruits and encouraged an alteration of microclimatic of fruit [
