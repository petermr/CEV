<p>Chlorosis is a distinctive sign of TSSM-infested plants resulting from chlorophyll degradation caused by TSSM feeding in combination with necrosis-like cell death. In contrast, chlorophyll and carotenoid significantly improved once the application of EO or FO compared to natural infested plants with the strongest effect obtained by JEO (
