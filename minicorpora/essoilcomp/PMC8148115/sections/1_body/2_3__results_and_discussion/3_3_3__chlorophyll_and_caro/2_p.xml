<p>A decline in photosynthetic pigment concentration represents a prime reaction to TSSM attack as it nourishes photosynthetically mesophyll cells. As the TSSM starts feeding on the lower epidermis of leaves, the mesophyll cells disintegrate and a tiny chlorotic area is observed. The quantity and rate of photosynthetic pigment modification have been shown to depend on TSSM mass and nourishing period [

 <xref rid="B54-biology-10-00410" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] hypothesized that by nourishing principally on phloem tissues, the TSSM modify the pH either on the leaf blade and thylakoid biomembrane, preventing the production of zeaxanthin, or on the stromal plane wherever restoration of violaxanthin occurred. Moreover, Burd and Elliott [
 <xref rid="B55-biology-10-00410" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] demonstrated that TSSM nourishing commonly reduces protein assimilation, creating irreparable photoinhibition in addition to blocking electron transport on the acceptor location of the photosystem II reaction center, evoking further decline in the system. In addition, the reduction in chlorophyll and carotenoid possibly resulted from the declining of pigment assimilation that may be caused by the modification in nutrients or lack of accumulation that drains towards the TSSM or to the influence of ROS on these pigments [
