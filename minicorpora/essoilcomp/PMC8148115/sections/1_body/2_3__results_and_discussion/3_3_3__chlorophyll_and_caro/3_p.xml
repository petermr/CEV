<p>The application of natural oils (EO or FO) increased the photosynthetic pigment concentration of eggplant leaves (
 <xref rid="biology-10-00410-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). This increase might be because of motivating chlorophyll and carotenoid assimilation and improving the effectiveness of chloroplasts with a superior prospective for resistance and reduction in the photophosphorylation rate that typically occurs once infected [

 <xref rid="biology-10-00410-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) that defend chlorophyll from oxidation and lastly amplified chlorophyll concentration as recorded in the existing research. Additionally, the application of natural oil increased the nitrogen content (needed for chlorophyll assimilation) and potassium uptake due to improving and regulating the plant architecture through increasing the primary root length, with a higher lateral and adventitious root number per plant, which will improve the absorption capacity of the root and increase the ion uptake [
