<p>Once the TSSM infestation percentage naturally reached 50% (1 December 2019), the plants were divided into four groups after the pre-count of the mobile phases of TSSM. Blocks of plants were separated from each other to prevent plant-touching and mites from moving between blocks, and they were surrounded with cloth barricades. The treatments were sprayed until dripping after adding a surfactant at 1%. Foliar applying was repeated, i.e., the first one at 1day post 50% infestation (DPI) and the second at 10 DPI. The entire plants were carefully enclosed by spraying oils, and care was taken to preserve a distance of approximately 30 cm between the nozzle and the plant shoots.</p>
