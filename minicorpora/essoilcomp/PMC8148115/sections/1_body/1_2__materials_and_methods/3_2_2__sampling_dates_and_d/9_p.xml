<p>Total Acidity was determined following the protocol presented in AOAC [
 <xref rid="B33-biology-10-00410" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. A total of 10 mL of eggplant juice is put into a 100 ml measuring flask, diluted to a tera mark. For the filtered sample, 20 mL of obtained filtrate was taken and inserted into an Erlenmeyer flask. Then, two drops of phenolphthalein were added to the sample and titrated with 0.1 N NaOH until turning pink. The calculation of the total acid was done by the following formula: Total acid = b/a, where a= amount of NaOH 0.1 N for titration (mL) and b = 10 mL of material. Total soluble solids of eggplant were estimated via a manual refractometer at 20 Â°C, and results were reported as Brix [
