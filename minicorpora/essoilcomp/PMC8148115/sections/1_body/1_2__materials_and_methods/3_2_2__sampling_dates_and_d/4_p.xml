<p>All harvested fruits from each plot were used for determination of the yield and its components (fruit number/plant, fruit dimension ‘length and diameter in cm,’ and total fruit yield/plant). Representative samples of eggplant fruits were arbitrarily acquired from the treatments at the fourth picking to assess the fruit quality attributes (protein percentage, total soluble phenol, ascorbic acid concentration, total acidity percentage, and total soluble solid content). Additionally, oven-dried (at 70 °C) powdered eggplant fruits were used for the estimation of the ion percentage in the fruit (N, P, and K%).</p>
