<p>For ion estimation [
 <xref rid="B31-biology-10-00410" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], dried plant samples (leaves or fruits) were ground to a fine powder, then mineralized by a mixture of sulfuric and nitric acids. Shoot N, P, and K% were determined in a digestible solution. Nitrogen was determined using the micro-Kjeldahl scheme. The colorimetric technique using a UV/VIS spectrophotometer was applied to assess P; finally, a Flamephotometer estimated K.
