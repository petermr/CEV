<p>The data were statistically analyzed through two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), at a 95% confidence level, using CoHort Software, 2008 statistical package (CoHort software, 2006; release, New York, NY, USA). The means were compared by Fisher’s least significant test (LSD). The statistical significance was considered as * 
 <italic>p</italic>≤ 0.05, ** 
 <italic>p</italic>≤ 0.01; *** 
 <italic>p</italic>≤ 0.001, and ns—not significant. Additionally, Duncan’s Multiple Range Test (DMRT) at 
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05 was selected to establish the significance of differences among treatments. The values in the tables are the means± standard error (SE)
