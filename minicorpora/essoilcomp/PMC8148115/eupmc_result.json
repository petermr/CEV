    "Eggplant is repeatedly attacked by numerous pests, particularly two-spotted spider mite (TSSM), which considerably decline plant productivity. Synthetic acaricides are frequently applied for controlling TSSM, resulting in environmental pollution. The utilization of rational novel substances which repel or prevent TSSM establishment represents a sustainable eco-friendly to reduce the utilization of agrochemicals. A greenhouse investigation was done for assessing the bio-acaricidal activity of mustard (<i>Brassica juncea</i> L.) fixed oil (MFO), jasmine (<i>Jasminum grandiflorum</i> L.) essential oil (JEO), or lavender (<i>Lavandula angustifolia</i> L.) essential oil (LEO), and their influences on eggplant growth and productivity. The results demonstrated that JEO represents the most acaricidal properties against TSSM followed by MFO and/or LEO compared to control. Spraying with natural oils significantly improved eggplant growth, i.e., plant height, number of leaves, and branches/plant, in addition to the leaf area and relative leaf dry mass of the 3rd-5th upper leaves. The JEO had the strongest positive effect compared with other oils or control. Additionally, Natural oils application significantly increased photosynthetic pigment, chlorophyll <sub>a:b</sub> ratio, and nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, ascorbic acid, and phenols. The application of oils increased yield and its quality. In this study, JEO (2.5 mL/l) is shown to be extremely promising for the progress of new eco-friendly acaricides, improving plant growth and increasing eggplant yield."
