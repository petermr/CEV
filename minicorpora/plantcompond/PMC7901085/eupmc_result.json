    "<h4>Background</h4>A plant growth-promoting endophytic bacterium PVL1 isolated from the leaf of Vanda cristata has the ability to colonize with roots of plants and protect the plant. PVL1 was isolated using laboratory synthetic media. 16S rRNA gene sequencing method has been employed for identification before and after root colonization ability.<h4>Results</h4>Original isolated and remunerated strain from colonized roots were identified as Bacillus spp. as per EzBiocloud database. The presence of bacteria in the root section of the plantlet was confirmed through Epifluorescence microscopy of colonized roots. The in-vitro plantlet colonized by PVL1 as well as DLMB attained higher growth than the control. PVL1 capable of producing plant beneficial phytohormone under in vitro cultivation. HPLC and GC-MS analysis suggest that colonized plants contain Indole Acetic Acid (IAA). The methanol extract of Bacillus spp., contains 0.015 μg in 1 μl concentration of IAA. PVL1 has the ability to produce antimicrobial compounds such as ethyl iso-allocholate, which exhibits immune restoring property. One-way ANOVA shows that results were statistically significant at P ≤ 0.05 level.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Hence, it has been concluded that Bacillus spp. PVL1 can promote plant growth through secretion of IAA during root colonization and ethyl iso-allocholate to protect plants from foreign infections. Thus, this study supports to support Koch's postulates of bacteria establishment."
