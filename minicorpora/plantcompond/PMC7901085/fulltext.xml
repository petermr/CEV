It has commercial value due to beautiful flowering part and possesses many scientific obscure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Habit of the plant allows specific microbiome in symbiotic association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Orchids endophytes were co-evolved with other soil microbial community. The microbial communities inhabit orchid plants in symbiotic association that provides nutrient and enhance immunity to the orchid. The engineering of the colonization pattern of the microbes hold the entire ecosystem of the planet. Orchid seed lacks endosperms because of its genetic makeup [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In this connection, the fungal community fits the role of the endosperm providing carbon source for the seed germination. Therefore, fungal association is crucial for the seed germination and development. However, just few percentage of the seed dust gets chance to established mycorrhizal association for germination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Moreover, there are endophytic bacteria possess important property for establishment of symbiotic association. Similarly, endophytic fungi such as <italic>Rhizoctonia</italic> sp., <italic>Tullsenlla</italic>, have been well explored for their orchid mycorrhizal nature. In nature, Orchids are in constant search of beneficial symbiotic pattern in existing natural places. They are few reports on orchid-bacteria interactions showing the potential roles of bacteria as a biological tool for the orchid conservation and bioactive compound production. However, some bacterial species along with fungi were considered as ideal source for studying orchid-microbes interaction and their impacts on development of orchid species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">The exploration of the beneficial or helper bacteria from the orchid species has the equal potential to conserve endangered orchid species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, few reports beneficial bacteria from the orchid species explained how bacteria interact with different orchid species. Potential applications of endophytic bacteria have been well studied in other plants. Especially, plant growth promoting rhizospheric bacteria (PGPR) were constantly reported as plant root colonizing endophytic bacteria that help plants in uptake of nutrient and minerals from soil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. PGPR play an important role in mineralization of organic phosphorus, iron, fixation of di-nitrogen, production of plant growth hormone and plant growth regulator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In this regard, the present study aims to isolate, characterize and reconfirms presence of leaf endophytic bacteria from the <italic>Vanda cristata</italic> (Orchid) that can colonise the roots of other orchid species; promote plant growth promotion and plant protection. <italic>Vanda cristata</italic> have become rare orchid species in forests of central Nepal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].

Moreover, these artificial calamities severely affected the regeneration and reestablishment of this plant. The present work describes how the bacterium residing in leaf of one orchid species can colonies the root across the genus and contribute for the fitness and growth of the plant?

This can be further explained by the biochemical assay experiments. The production of IAA by PVL1 as detected and quantified by using HPLC technique. The production of IAA in concentration of 0.015&#x02009;&#x003bc;g per &#x003bc;L, when supplemented 2&#x02009;mg of DL-Tryptophan in 20&#x02009;mL of broth shows its capacity to produce IAA. The bacterial ethyl acetate extract contain numerous phytohormone and plant growth factor that have play major role in plant growth has been proven by characterization of metabolite present in both plant colonized and bacterial extract. The bioactive compounds identified from the bacterial extract, non-colonized plant extract and PVL1 and DLMB colonized extract clearly explains the bacterial produce some important plant hormone, growth factor and growth regulators that promotes the growth of the plant. Similarly, the detection of antioxidant as well as molecules contributes to the fitness of the plant against pathogen and abiotic stress. Apart from IAA, the presence of plant metabolites such as 6-Acetyl-beta-d-mannose, Cyclopropane L-Ascorbic acid 6-palmitate, Eicosanoic acid, d-Mannitol, 1-O-(22-hydroxydocosyl)-, Ethyl iso-allocholate and Oleic acid are some important bioactive compounds that help to overcome both abiotic and biotic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Among these Oleic acid is detected in bacterial extract as well as in bacteria colonized plant extract. Whereas Mannitol, L-Ascorbic acid was only seen in both PVL1 and DLMB colonized plant extract. This indicates the bacterial has helped the in-vitro plantlet to trigger its own immune system. Whereas Cyclopropane is one of the important precursor biomolecules for the production of plant hormone ethylene was detected bacterial extract. The DAPI staining of the root treated with bacteria show the presence of bacteria in the cell of the root section.
