      "The use of plants as a source of sedative or treatment for cancer is reasonably widespread worldwide. <i>Annona muricata</i> Linn exhibits a vast array of medicinal and ethno-pharmaceutical benefits, attributed by different plant parts. The activity of this plant is regarded to the bio-production of secondary metabolites like alkaloids, phenols, flavonoids, and most unique group of compounds, namely, annonaceous acetogenins. Whilst this plant is gaining popularity as an anticancer treating plant, this study was undertaken to verify the plausible anticancer effect of leaf methanol extracts of <i>A. muricata</i> (LEAM). Acute toxicity study was carried to obtain safe dose in mice models using haematological, biochemical, and histological evaluations in Swiss albino mice. <i>In-vitro</i> cytotoxicity towards Dalton's Lymphoma Ascites (DLA) and Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma (EAC) cell lines were determined by trypan blue exclusion method. <i>In-vivo</i> antitumour activity of LEAM (100, 200, and 500mg/kg b.wt.) was evaluated using DLA induced solid carcinoma and EAC induced ascites carcinoma models and its comparison with standard drug Cisplatin. Acute toxicity studies did not exhibit significant variations in treated mice suggesting diminutive side effects of LEAM. Statistical analysis revealed the IC<sub>50</sub> values for DLA and EAC cell lines as 85.56 ± 5.28 and 68.07 ± 7.39 µg/mL, respectively, indicating better cytotoxic activity against EAC than DLA cells. LEAM decreased the tumour burden in dose-dependent manner. In comparison, with different concentrations tested, treatment with LEAM (200 mg/kg b.wt. and 500 mg/kg b.wt.) significantly reduced the solid tumour volume development by 58.11% and 65.70%, respectively. While lifespan was prolonged up to 51.43% in 500 mg/kg b.wt. LEAM treated ascites tumour-induced mice. This study thus indicates that LEAM possesses potent cytotoxic and antineoplastic activity and calls for more methodical safety assessments and other end-points of anti-tumourigenesis. <b>Abbreviations</b>: <b>LEAM</b>: Leaf methanol extract of <i>Annona</i> muricata; <b>DLA</b>: Dalton's Lymphoma Ascites; <b>EAC</b>: Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma; <b>IC<sub>50</sub></b> : Half maximal inhibitory concentration; <b>CPCSEA</b>: Committee for the Purpose of Control Supervision of Experiments on Animal; <b>IAEC</b>: Institutional Animal Ethics Committee; <b>ARRIVE</b>: Animal Research: Reporting <i>In-vivo</i> Experiments; <b>DMSO</b>: Dimethyl sulphoxide; <b>LD<sub>50</sub></b> : Lethal Dose, 50%; <b>SD</b>: Standard Deviation; <b>Hb</b>: Haemoglobin; <b>RBC</b>: Red blood cells; <b>WBC</b>: White blood cells; <b>HCT</b>: Hematocrit; <b>MCV</b>: Mean cell volume; <b>MCH</b>: Mean cell haemoglobin; <b>MCHC</b>: Mean cell haemoglobin concentration; <b>SALP</b>: Serum alkaline phosphatase; <b>SGPT</b>: Serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase; <b>SGOT</b>: Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase; <b>ATP</b>: Adenosine triphosphate; <b>EGFR</b>: Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor."

      "The consumption of exogenous antioxidants isolated from herbal extracts has shown beneficial effects on ameliorating dialysis-related complications through debilitating oxidative stress and inflammatory process. Many clinical studies available in public databases have reported the improved consequences of dialysis in patients supplemented with herbal antioxidants. Exploration of such data offers great possibilities for gaining insights into the potential mechanisms and medical implications of herbal antioxidants. In this work, the mechanisms and implications of some famous bioactive substances including silymarin, curcumin, resveratrol, emodin, and quercetin on the consequences of dialysis in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients were explored. The protective features of silymarin are due to the flavonoid complex silybin. Curcumin is an active element from the root of curcuma longa with extensive beneficial properties, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory activity, and inhibitory effects on cell apoptosis. Resveratrol can reduce the oxidative stress by neutralization of free radicals. Emodin is known as a natural anthraquinone derivative isolated from Chinese herbs. Finally, quercetin has been reported to exhibit several properties including antioxidant, anti-diabetic, analgesic, antihistaminic, antiviral, cholesterol reducer, and renal hemodynamic modulator. However, potential mechanisms and medical implications of the aforementioned herbal antioxidants seem to be more complicated, that is, more studies are required in this field."

      "Analyses of HPAI H5 viruses from poultry outbreaks across a wide Eurasian region since July 2020 including the Russian Federation, Republics of Iraq and Kazakhstan, and recent detections in migratory waterfowl in the Netherlands, revealed undetected maintenance of H5N8, likely in galliform poultry since 2017/18 and both H5N5 and H5N1. All viruses belong to A/H5 clade 2.3.4.4b with closely related HA genes. Heterogeneity in Eurasian H5Nx HPAI emerging variants threatens poultry production, food security and veterinary public health."

      "<h4>Context</h4><i>Pandanus odoratissimus</i> Linn. (Pandanaceae) seed extract is known to have antioxidant activities. However, the potential hepatoprotective effect is still unclear.<h4>Objective</h4>To investigate the hepatoprotection aspect of <i>P. odoratissimus</i> methanol extract towards paracetamol-induced rats.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into six equal groups: one group served as the healthy control and five groups with hepatotoxicity (hepatotoxic control and 4 treatment groups). The oral treatment of paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity of 3 g/kg using three different concentrations of <i>P. odoratissimus</i> (300, 600 and 900 mg/kg), and silymarin (200 mg/kg) groups were administered once a day for 14 days. Enzyme activities and protein levels in serum were determined in rats at the end of the treatments. The histopathology of rat livers was observed under an electron microscope with 10× magnification.<h4>Results</h4><i>Pandanus odoratissimus</i> significantly decreased the serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT) activities in induced-paracetamol rat serum (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Moreover, <i>P. odoratissimus</i> significantly decreased total bilirubin and direct bilirubin levels (<i>p</i> < 0.05). It significantly blocked the decline of serum albumin and protein levels (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Histopathological changes amplified paracetamol-induced liver damage and the hepatoprotective effect of <i>P. odoratissimus</i> in the liver.<h4>Discussion and conclusions</h4><i>Pandanus odoratissimus</i> improved the hepatoprotective effect in a concentration-dependent manner by reducing related hepatic enzyme and protein markers, suggesting as a useful agent in hepatotoxicity treatment, and it can be generalized to a broader study population in different hepatotoxic animal models."

      "<h4>Context</h4>Bufadienolide compounds occur in many plants and animal species and have strong cardiac and anti-inflammatory properties. The compounds have been recently investigated for cytotoxic and antitumor activity.<h4>Objective</h4>The cytotoxic effect of bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate <b>-</b> a bufadienolide steroid occuring in plants from <i>Kalanchoe</i> genus (Crassulaceae), was evaluated with cervical cancer HeLa cells <i>in vitro</i>.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The cytotoxic activity of the compound (at 0.1-20.0 μg/mL) on the cells was determined by Real-Time Cell Analysis (RTCA) system for 24 h. The estimation of cell cycle arrest, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and caspases-3/7/9 activity in the HeLa cells treated with the compound was done by flow cytometry and luminometric technique. DNA damage in the cells was estimated by immunofluorescence staining and the comet assay with etoposide as a positive control.<h4>Results</h4>The compound had strong effect on the cells (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.55 μg/mL) by the suppression of HeLa cells proliferation in G2/M phase of cell cycle and induction of cell death through double-stranded DNA damage and reactive oxygen species overproduction. Furthermore, we did not observe an increase in the activity of caspase-3/7/9 in the treated cells as well as a decrease in cellular mitochondrial membrane potential. Gene expression analysis revealed the overexpression of NF-Kappa-B inhibitors genes (>2-fold higher than control) in the treated cells.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate induces cell cycle arrest and caspase-independent cell death through double-stranded DNA damage. These results are an important step in further studies on cell death signalling pathways induced by bufadienolides."

      "Phytohormones mediate plant development and responses to stresses caused by biotic agents or abiotic factors. The functions of phytohormones in responses to viral infection have been intensively studied, and the emerging picture of complex mechanisms provides insights into the roles that phytohormones play in defense regulation as a whole. These hormone signaling pathways are not simple linear or isolated cascades, but exhibit crosstalk with each other. Here, we summarized the current understanding of recent advances for the classical defense hormones salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), and ethylene (ET) and also the roles of abscisic acid (ABA), auxin, gibberellic acid (GA), cytokinins (CKs), and brassinosteroids (BRs) in modulating plant-virus interactions."

      "<h4>Background</h4>A plant growth-promoting endophytic bacterium PVL1 isolated from the leaf of Vanda cristata has the ability to colonize with roots of plants and protect the plant. PVL1 was isolated using laboratory synthetic media. 16S rRNA gene sequencing method has been employed for identification before and after root colonization ability.<h4>Results</h4>Original isolated and remunerated strain from colonized roots were identified as Bacillus spp. as per EzBiocloud database. The presence of bacteria in the root section of the plantlet was confirmed through Epifluorescence microscopy of colonized roots. The in-vitro plantlet colonized by PVL1 as well as DLMB attained higher growth than the control. PVL1 capable of producing plant beneficial phytohormone under in vitro cultivation. HPLC and GC-MS analysis suggest that colonized plants contain Indole Acetic Acid (IAA). The methanol extract of Bacillus spp., contains 0.015 μg in 1 μl concentration of IAA. PVL1 has the ability to produce antimicrobial compounds such as ethyl iso-allocholate, which exhibits immune restoring property. One-way ANOVA shows that results were statistically significant at P ≤ 0.05 level.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Hence, it has been concluded that Bacillus spp. PVL1 can promote plant growth through secretion of IAA during root colonization and ethyl iso-allocholate to protect plants from foreign infections. Thus, this study supports to support Koch's postulates of bacteria establishment."

      "Formation of higher-order supramolecular complexes has emerged as a common principle underlying activity of a number of immune and regulated cell-death signalling pathways in animals, plants and fungi. Some of these signalosomes employ functional amyloid motifs in their assembly process. The description of such systems in fungi finds its origin in earlier studies on a fungal prion termed [Het-s], originally identified as a non-Mendelian cytoplasmic infectious element. Janine Beisson has been a key contributor to such early studies. Recent work on this and related systems offers a more integrated view framing this prion in a broader picture including related signalling systems described in animals. We propose here an auto-commentary centred on three recent studies on amyloid signalling in microbes. Collectively, these studies increase our understanding of fold conservation in functional amyloids and the structural basis of seeding, highlight the relation of fungal amyloid motifs to mammalian RHIM (RIP homotypic interaction motif) and expand the concept of Nod-like receptor-based amyloid signalosomes to the prokaryote reign."

      "Plant diseases and pests are important factors determining the yield and quality of plants. Plant diseases and pests identification can be carried out by means of digital image processing. In recent years, deep learning has made breakthroughs in the field of digital image processing, far superior to traditional methods. How to use deep learning technology to study plant diseases and pests identification has become a research issue of great concern to researchers. This review provides a definition of plant diseases and pests detection problem, puts forward a comparison with traditional plant diseases and pests detection methods. According to the difference of network structure, this study outlines the research on plant diseases and pests detection based on deep learning in recent years from three aspects of classification network, detection network and segmentation network, and the advantages and disadvantages of each method are summarized. Common datasets are introduced, and the performance of existing studies is compared. On this basis, this study discusses possible challenges in practical applications of plant diseases and pests detection based on deep learning. In addition, possible solutions and research ideas are proposed for the challenges, and several suggestions are given. Finally, this study gives the analysis and prospect of the future trend of plant diseases and pests detection based on deep learning."
