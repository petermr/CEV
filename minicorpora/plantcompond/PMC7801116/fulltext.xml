The name of this group of compounds comes from genus <italic>Bufo</italic> (the toad) which contains bufadienolides (Kamboj et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). These compounds were identified in species like <italic>Bufo marinus</italic> L. (Bufonidae) (Matsukawa et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>), <italic>B. viridis</italic> Laurenti (Uasnova et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), <italic>B. gargarizans</italic> Cantor (Tian et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), <italic>B. rubescens</italic> Lutz (Cunha Filho et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), <italic>Fusarium poae</italic> (Peck) Wollenw.

(Morishita et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>), <italic>Photinus</italic> (Lampyridae), and <italic>Rhabdophis</italic> (Colubridae) (Kamboj et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In addition to animals, many plant species also contain bufadienolides. They were identified in <italic>Kalanchoe</italic> (Crassulaceae), <italic>Tylecodon</italic> (Crassulaceae), <italic>Helleborus</italic> (Ranunculaceae), <italic>Scilla</italic> (Hyacinthaceae), <italic>Cotyledon</italic> (Crassulaceae), <italic>Urginea</italic> (Hyacinthaceae), <italic>Mimosa</italic> (Fabaceae), <italic>Millettia</italic> (Fabaceae), and <italic>Drimia</italic> genus (Hyacinthaceae) (Stoll et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">1933</xref>; Wagner et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>; Steyn et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>; Botha et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Pohl et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Watanabe et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Goel &#x00026; Ram <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p><p>The compounds have been used from ancient times as medicines in cardiac dysfunction due to their strong effect on the heart. Nowadays, they are well-known as inhibitors of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump and cause increase in the contractile force of the heart (Kamboj et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Furthermore, they alter myocardial ion balance and increase intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (Melero et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Schoner &#x00026; Scheiner-Bobis <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Kolodziejczyk-Czepas &#x00026; Stochmal <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Among other pharmacological properties, bufadienolides have also antiviral, antibacterial, insecticidal, anti-angiogenic, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities (Kamboj et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Recently, the compounds have been investigated for cytotoxic and anticancer properties in normal and cancer cell lines (Gao et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Han et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The results indicate that this group of compounds causes significant inhibition of cell growth, proliferation and induction of cell death. For example, Iguchi et&#x000a0;al. isolated bufadienolides from <italic>Helleborus foetidus</italic> L. and showed their cytotoxicity against leukaemia (HL-60) and lung cancer (A549) cell lines (Iguchi et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Proscillaridin A revealed antitumor effects on glioblastoma cells, but not on normal cells &#x02013; astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (Berges et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Next, cinobufagin was tested on human breast cancer MCF-7 cells. The compound inhibited cell growth and triggered apoptosis by affecting the expression of Bax and Bcl-2 in the cells (Zhu et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Arenobufagin also reduced viability of MCF-7 cells and induced apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Deng et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).</p><p>Some of the reports describe investigations on <italic>Kalanchoe</italic> species, which are more and more popular as house ornamental plants. These plants have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and cytotoxic properties. However, only <italic>K. brasiliensis</italic> Camb. has been described as a remedy in human prostate cancer treatment (Johnson <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). Studies on cytotoxic activities of <italic>Kalanchoe</italic> plants containing bufadienolides are focussed on main isolated metabolites. For example, bryophyllin B (from <italic>K. pinnata</italic> (Lam.) Pers.) has strong cytotoxic activity on the KB cell line (Yamagishi et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>). Kalanchosides A&#x02013;C (from <italic>K. gracilis</italic> Hance) revealed toxic activity on lung (A549), prostate (PC-3), epidermoid (A431), and ovarian (1A9) cancer cell lines (Wu et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Bufadienolides isolated from the leaves of <italic>K. pinnata</italic> and <italic>K. daigremontiana</italic> &#x000d7; <italic>tubiflora</italic> (Harv.) Raym.-Hamet &#x00026; H. Perrier showed antitumor-promoting activity on Burkitt&#x02019;s lymphoma Raji cells (Supratman et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Kalantuboside A and B, bryotoxin C, bersaldegenin-1-acetate, and bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate from <italic>K. tubiflora</italic> showed significant effects against oral adenosquamous carcinoma (Cal-27), lung adenocarcinoma (A549), promyelocytic leukaemia (HL-60), and melanoma (A2058) cell lines (Huang et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In our previous study on <italic>K. daigremontiana</italic>, bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>) demonstrated strong cytotoxic activity on cervical (HeLa), ovarian (SKOV-3), melanoma (A375), and breast (MCF-7) cell lines (Stefanowicz-Hajduk et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Some of the above mentioned bufadienolides have determined the molecular mode of cell death.

Individual bufadienolides were purified isocratically by a semi-preparative HPLC on a C18 column (Kromasil 100-5-C18, 250&#x02009;mm &#x000d7; 10&#x02009;mm, 5&#x02009;&#x003bc;m), using different concentrations of aqueous methanol solutions with 0.1% (v/v) HCOOH. The one from the isolated compounds was bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate. The yield of this compound was 0.32&#x02009;mg (0.032%) in 1&#x02009;g of dry mass of the root.

Our results indicate that the compound is strong cytotoxic agent and its effect is time- and dose-dependent.</p><p>The antiproliferative and cytotoxic effect of bufadienolides is known, however available data concerning these activities are limited. Han et&#x000a0;al. tested a few bufadienolides (hellebrigenin, hellebrigenol, arenobufagin, bufotalin, and bufalin) on human liver cancer cells (HepG2). The results indicated that these compounds have significant antiproliferative effects in a concentration range below 150&#x02009;ng/mL (Han et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). These authors also studied arenobufagin and hellebrigenin on human glioblastoma cell line U-87 (Han et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Dose-dependent cytotoxicity was observed in these cells at the compounds concentration of about 20&#x02009;ng/mL. Furthermore, this effect was not observed in normal cells &#x02013; mouse primary astrocytes. Another authors showed inhibitory effect of bufalin and cinobufagin on the proliferation of androgen dependent (LNCaP) and independent prostate cancer cell lines (DU145 and PC3) (Yeh et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>).</p><p>There are only a few reports on biological activity of bersaldegenin derivatives on normal and cancer cells (Kolodziejczyk-Czepas et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Stefanowicz-Hajduk et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). In our previous study, we showed that bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate caused very significant decrease in viability of HeLa, SKOV-3, MCF-7, and A375 cell lines. We also observed that this compound did not trigger an increase in the population of early apoptotic cells (Stefanowicz-Hajduk et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). To estimate the signalling pathway leading to cell death after treatment with the bersaldegenin compound, we have prepared experiments with HeLa cells in the present study. The microscopic, flow cytometry, luminometric, and RT-qPCR results indicate that the tested compound induced mostly caspase-independent cell death. Microscopic observation of the treated cells revealed that the HeLa cell nuclei had disorganized chromatin with homogenous dispersed DNA fragments. These changes, revealed after Hoechst staining, were not similar to typical morphological features of apoptotic cells. Furthermore, another performed experiments showed that bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate induced reactive oxygen species overproduction and did not cause depolarization of mitochondrial membrane as well as activation of initiating caspase-9 and effector caspases-3/7. What is important, the compound strongly induced cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase. This is often associated with activation of S- and G2/M phase DNA damage checkpoints. This damage can be induced by exogenous (e.g., alkylating compounds, antitumor chemotherapeutics, plant metabolites, UV, radiation) and endogenous agents such as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species that are produced during cellular metabolism (Jackson &#x00026; Bartek <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). In this process, cell cycle arrest and inhibition of DNA replication occur (Mannuss et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In our study, we observed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) damage in HeLa cells treated with bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate during the comet assay. Furthermore, as confirmation of the comet assay results we prepared the immunofluorescence staining and observed accumulation of phosphorylated histone H2A.X (&#x003b3;H2AX) in the cells &#x02013; an indicator of the level of ds DNA damage in nuclei, what also confirms the role of DNA-damage response in the compound treated cells (Jackson &#x00026; Bartek <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p><p>DNA damage plays a crucial role in cell homeostasis and is associated with NF-kappa-B (NF-&#x0043a;B) family factors which regulate physiological and pathological processes. These proteins are located in the cytoplasm and are associated with a family of inhibitors of NF-&#x0043a;B proteins (I&#x0043a;Bs). After stimulation, I&#x0043a;B undergoes degradation in a proteasome, and the free NF-&#x0043a;B translocates to the nucleus and regulates genes transcription (Wang et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). NF-&#x0043a;B activation depends on activity of these inhibitors and can occur in response to DNA damage. Induction of synthesis of NF-&#x0043a;B inhibitors antagonises NF-&#x0043a;B activity and prevents prolonged NF-&#x0043a;B activation (Sun et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; Chiao et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>). In our study, we show that DNA was damaged in HeLa cells treated with the bersaldegenin and this may be associated with NF-&#x0043a;B pathway. The obtained gene analysis revealed very significant overexpression of NF-&#x0043a;B inhibitors genes (NF&#x003ba;BIZ, NF&#x003ba;BIB, and NF&#x003ba;BIA) and downregulation of I&#x0043a;B kinases family genes. However, further studies evaluating the role of these factors in the cell death pathway need to be performed.</p><p>In bufadienolide compounds family, determination of cellular mechanisms leading to cell death was done with cinobufagin. The compound was tested on human multiple myeloma (MM) U266 cells and caused pro-apoptotic effects through ROS-mediated activation of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK pathways and the activation of caspase-3 in the cells (Baek et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Also in other studies, cinobufagin caused ROS overproduction, decreased MMP in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Zhang et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The compound induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by activation of caspase-3, chromatin condensation, DNA degradation and inhibition of the AKT/mTOR signalling pathway in the tested cells. Next, gamabufotalin induced autophagy and activation of p38 MAPK pathway in human glioblastoma cell line U-87 (Yuan et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Bufalin induced ROS overproduction, reduced MMP, activated caspases-9/-3 and DNA damage in human lung cancer cell line NCI-H460 (Wu et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S0005" disp-level="1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate strongly induces caspase-independent cell death in cancer HeLa cells which is associated with cell cycle arrest in G2/Mphase, ROS overproduction, and double-stranded DNA damage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM4043"><caption><title>Supplemental Material</title></caption><media xlink:href="IPHB_A_1866025_SM4043.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec id="S0006" disp-level="1" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Disclosure statement</title><p>The authors declare no conflicts of interest.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Adamska</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Stefanowicz-Hajduk</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Ochocka</surname><given-names>JR.</given-names></name></person-group>
