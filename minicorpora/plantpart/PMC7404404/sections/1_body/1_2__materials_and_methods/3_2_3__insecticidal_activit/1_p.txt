0: The essential oil was screened for insecticidal activity based on the method of Ilboudo and co-workers [ 40] with modifications.
1: Sitophilus oryzae (L.) (rice weevil) were reared on whole rice (10:1 w/w).
2: Adult insects, 1a7 days old, were used for contact toxicity tests.
3: The insects were cultured in a dark growth chamber at a temperature of 27 A 1 AC with relative humidity of 65 A 5%.
4: The insecticidal activity of  L. taraxacifolia oil against  S. oryzae (rice weevil) was evaluated by treatment of Whatman No.
5: 1 filter paper discs with the essential oil diluted in ethanol.
6: The required quantities of oil (0.10, 0.20, 0.30, and 0.40 AL) were diluted to 1 mL with ethanol and applied to filter paper discs, respectively.
7: Permethrin (0.6% w/w) and ethanol were used as positive and negative controls, respectively.
8: The solvent was allowed to evaporate from the filter paper, which was then placed into polyethylene cups (80 mm diameter).
9: Ten well-fed mixed sex adult  S. oryzae were introduced into the polyethylene cups, containing 20 g uninfected rice grains, and covered with a muslin cloth, held in place with rubber bands.
10: Each treatment was replicated four times.
11: Control experiments were set up as described as above without the essential oil.
12: The experiment was arranged in a complete randomized design on a laboratory bench.
13: The insect was considered dead when the legs or antennae were observed to be immobile.
14: Insect mortalities were investigated by observing the recovery of immobilized insects after 24 h intervals for 120 h and the percentage of insect mortality was corrected using the Abbott formula [ 41].
15: Probit analysis [ 42] using XLSTAT version 2018.1.1.60987 (Addinsofta, Paris, France) was used to estimate median lethal concentration (LC 50) values and insect toxicity data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA TukeyaTMs honestly significant difference test.
