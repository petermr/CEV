0: The chemical composition of  L. taraxacifolia essential oil was determined by gas chromatographyamass spectrometry (GC-MS) using a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 Ultra operated in the electron impact (EI) mode (electron energy = 70 eV), scan range = 40a400 atomic mass units, with a scan rate of 3.0 scans per s, with GC-MS solution software.
1: The GC column was a ZB-5 fused silica capillary column (30 m length A 0.25 mm inner diameter) with a 5% phenyl-polymethylsiloxane stationary phase and a film thickness of 0.25 I14m.
2: Helium gas was used as a carrier gas with column head pressure of 552 kPa at a flow rate of 1.37 mL/min.
3: The injector temperature was 250 AC and the ion source temperature was 200 AC.
4: The oven temperature of 50 AC was initially programmed for the GC and gradually increased at 2 AC/min to 260 AC.
5: The sample (5% w/v) was dissolved in dichloromethane and 0.1 I14L of the solution was injected using a split injection technique (30:1).
6: Identification of the essential oil components was achieved by comparing the retention indices determined with respect to a homologous series of  n-alkanes, and by comparison of the mass spectral fragmentation patterns with those stored in the MS databases [ 36, 37, 38, 39].
