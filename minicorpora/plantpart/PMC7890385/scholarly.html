Abstract</div> <p id="Par1">The management of house fly, <i>Musca domestica</i> has become immensely important to prevent epidemics of many detrimental diseases. In view of this objective, the present study demonstrates the efficacy of lemongrass (LG) and tea tree essential oils (TTEOs) against <i>M. domestica</i>. The TTEO proved to be more lethal against larvae and adults of <i>M. domestica</i> depicting an LC<sub>50</sub> at 14.88Â mg/ dm<sup>3</sup> which was 17.19Â mg/ dm<sup>3</sup> for LGEO. In contrast, pupicidal effect of LGEO was much higher (LD<sub>50</sub>, 14.49Â Âµl/0.25L) as compared to TTEO. The LGEO drastically reduced the total body sugar, glycogen and protein contents by 3.29, 2.95 and 7.56 fold, respectively, contrasting with high influence of TTEO on lipid content of the late 3rd instar larvae. A considerable reduction in gut enzymes secretion was observed due to treatment of EOs thereby altering gut physiology of the insect. Moreover, significant inhibition of acetylcholine esterase (AchE) was also observed with LGEO at LC<sub>50</sub> concentration (5.33Â mg/ml) inhibiting insect neurotransmission. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) analysis of the LGEO showed 12 major compounds dominated by Citral whereas TTEO contained only 5 major compounds. Further analysis by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) revealed distortion and shrinkage of larval bodies caused by the treatment of EOs. These overall observations brand LG and TT-EOs as potential organic-insecticides against <i>M. domestica</i>.</p> </div> <div class="graphicabstract" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Introduction</div> <p id="Par3">The holometabolous insect, <i>Musca domestica</i> also called house fly plays its part as a vector of many fatal diseases. It has become a worldwide problem for transmission of pathogens such as protozoan cysts, helminth parasites, enteropathogenic bacteria, Turkey coronavirus, enterovirus as well as avian flu [<a href="#CR1">1</a>]. It causes heavy damage to livestock, poultry and humans. It has been very instrumental for the epidemics of dysentery, diphtheria, typhoid, leprosy in humans, whereas fowl cholera and anthrax diseases of poultry and livestock [<a href="#CR2">2</a>]. The frequent movement of flies between animals and rotten food makes them ideal porters for disease causing pathogens. Therefore, the population control of this pest below threshold levels becomes immensely important from the public health viewpoint and has attracted attention of the scientific community worldwide. During the last century chemical control was the only potential option for managing this insect, but in the present era of advanced technologies many prospective alternatives, such as cultural tactics and biological agents, are routinely used for controlling this pest. Moreover, house flies are reported to show resistance to chemical agents such as organochlorines, organophosphates, pyrethroids, etc. [<a href="#CR3">3</a>]. Furthermore, synthetic pesticides are also well-known to harm non-target organisms, cause bioaccumulation in trophic levels, ecological imbalances and environmental pollution. Thus, there is a dire need to prospect for new, promising and sustainable biological agents that could be potential tools for managing the housefly populations below threshold levels. Prospectively, there are renewed efforts to develop plant-based formulations which could be considered as highly effective, eco-friendly, cheap, biodegradable and safe for humankind as well as theÂ environment. According to Isman, favorable eco-toxicological properties of botanical pesticides make them potentially suitable for use in integrated pest management (IPM) programs [<a href="#CR4">4</a>]. Consequently, essential oils (EO) extracted from plants are reviewed as potential plant-based organic-agents due to their inherent valuable properties.</p> <p id="Par4">Since EOs are mixtures of organic compounds that can accomplish multiple functions such as protein denaturation, enzymatic inhibition and membrane disintegration in animals [<a href="#CR5">5</a>]. Some compounds may act as insect growth regulators (IGR) affecting the neuromuscular system of pests and mimic the symptoms of organophosphates. While others absorb through the cuticle and function as fumigants causing respiratory damage [<a href="#CR6">6</a>]. Since every pesticide has its pros and cons but the specialty of plant-based formulations being species-specific and biodegradable makes them an ideal choice for future pest management practices. The EOs from LG and TT are known to be stress relievers bearing many medicinal properties for humans. However, their valorization for pest management in general and house flies in particular has remained to be explored. Thus, in the present study, we investigated the effects of LG and TTEOs against the menacing house fly, <i>M. domestica</i>. The efficacy of EOs were tested on different life stages of the model insect by using various biochemical techniques while the morphological alterations imposed by EO treatment were also determined using FESEM. Moreover, attempts were made to explore the composition of EOs under consideration in order to confirm the active ingredients responsible for insecticidal properties.</p> </div> <div class="materialandmethods" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Insect Rearing</div> <p id="Par6">The culture of housefly, <i>M. domestica</i> procured from the national chemical laboratory (NCL), Pune (M.S.), India, was maintained at 28â€‰Â±â€‰2Â Â°C and 60â€"70% R.H. for several generations in plastic jars of 35â€‰Ã—â€‰15Â cm dimension as described previously [<a href="#CR7">7</a>]. The jars were covered with muslin cloth to prevent the flies from escape. The adult flies were fed <i>ad libitum</i> on 10% milk solution (w/v) offered through a cotton swab which served dual purpose for food as well as substratum for oviposition. The food was changed regularly to prevent the contamination by microorganisms. The rod-shaped eggs laid in batches were whitish in color and approximately 1.2Â mm in size (Fig.Â <a href="#Fig1">1</a>a). The eggs after oviposition were stored in different sets of jars for hatching. The newly hatched larvae, creamy whitish in color (Fig.Â <a href="#Fig1">1</a>b) were fed on milk solution. The first to third larval instars were identified on the basis of size of the larva and time after hatching by following the descriptions of Hussein and Capinera [<a href="#CR8">8</a>]. The collected pupae were kept separate for emergence into adult. Finally, the freshly emerged adults were also used for various bioassays. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig.Â 1</span></a></div>   <p>An outline of the different bioassays carried out in the present study. <b>a</b> set up for larvicidal assay, <b>b</b> Adulticidal assay carried out in plastic jars containing petri dish sprayed with milk solution as food, <b>c</b> Pupicidal assay and <b>d</b> Attractant/repellent assay</p>   </div> <p /> </div> <div class="larvicidalassay" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Larvicidal Assay</div> <p id="Par7">The larvicidal assays were carried out by using the residual film method [<a href="#CR7">7</a>] with slight modifications. Briefly, the effect of different concentrations of tested oils, were checked on 3rd instar larvae (<i>n</i>â€‰=â€‰10) to determine the LC<sub>50</sub> and LC<sub>90</sub> concentrations. To achieve this, 1Â mL of the acetone solution containing desired concentration of EO, were spread uniformly on filter paper disc laid inside the glass petri dish of 90-mm-diameter (Fig.Â <a href="#Fig1">1</a>a). The petri dishes were left open till solvent evaporation followed by inoculation of larvae (<i>n</i>â€‰â‰¥â€‰10). These tests were carried out under strictly maintained rearing conditions for 24Â h. However, in control experiments only solvent, i.e., acetone in place of EO was sprayed following a similar procedure to that in test sets. The larvae were fed on cotton swab soaked in milk solution. The actual dose of EO present in 1Â mL mixture was calculated by using theÂ following formula considering the area of petri dish as 63.58Â cm<sup>2</sup>. </p><div class="disp-formula" title="disp-formula"> <div class="alternatives" title="alternatives"> <div class="tex" title="tex"> <div class="tex-math_UNKNOWN" id="M1">

Adulticidal Bioassay</div> <p id="Par8">The adulticidal assay on <i>M. domestica</i> was carried out according to the method described previously [<a href="#CR7">7</a>] with minor changes. The bioassays were designed such that the flies would have a maximum probability of exposure to the tested concentration of EOs. The adult houseflies (<i>n</i>â€‰=â€‰10) were transferred to a plastic jar of 1.2Â dm<sup>3</sup> having a cotton yarn attached internally to the cap (Fig.Â <a href="#Fig1">1</a>b). The cotton yarn was sprayed with different concentrations of EO in the range of 10â€"100Â mg/dm<sup>3</sup> which was dissolved in 10 ÂµL acetone. To avoid direct contact of flies with EO, the cotton yarn was covered with a thin muslin cloth. In case of control set, the cotton yarn enclosed in muslin cloth contained only 10 ÂµL of acetone. The experiments were replicated 10 times at 28â€‰Â±â€‰2Â Â°C for 30Â min to calculate the mortality rate caused by EO treatment.</p> </div> <div class="attractant/repellantbioassay" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Larvicidal Activity</div> <p id="Par18">Among the EOsÂ tested against theÂ larvae of <i>M. domestica</i>, it was observed that TTEO proved to be more effective as compared to LGEO as depicted by the lower concentration required for 50% mortality of the larvae (TableÂ <a href="#Tab1">1</a>). The TTEO showed higher larvicidal activity at LC<sub>50</sub> 4.94Â mg/mL (actual dose was 0.0776Â Âµg/cm<sup>2</sup>) which was very low and statistically significant (<i>p</i>â€‰<div class="â€‰0.001_UNKNOWN">
2) to kill 50% of pest populations. Though it is not surprising to observe the increased mortality rate with increased concentrations of EO but the time required by TTEO to achieve LC<sub>50</sub> which was only 24Â h is quite fascinating (Fig.Â <a href="#Fig2">2</a>a). It can further elucidate that short-term exposure of larvae to lethal doses can markedly increase their mortality over time, and thus reduce the population levels below threshold. Our observations were in line with Shalaby and coworkers who reported that lemon oil shows higher larvicidal activity [<a href="#CR16">16</a>].

Pupicidal Bioassay</div> <p id="Par21">The literature related to deformity of insects by EO is scanty, and the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. The pupicidal assay carried out by two different methods proved that contact toxicity also known as topical method is more effective than fumigation approach for housefly control with LG and TTEOs. In fumigation assay, the lethal dose evaluated by probit analysis showed significant activity with LGEO which exhibited LD<sub>50</sub> and LD<sub>90</sub> values at 14.49 ÂµL/0.25L and 37.45 ÂµL/0.25L, respectively. The TTEO showed LD<sub>50</sub> and LD<sub>90</sub> concentrations as 29.68 ÂµL/0.25L and 59.51 ÂµL/0.25L. In fumigation assay LGEO was found to be more toxic against pupae than TTEO (Fig.Â <a href="#Fig3">3</a>). In case of contact toxicity method none of the flies emerged into normal adults ensuring either 100% mortality of the pupae or deformities after emergence due to EO treatment. The LGEO showed complete (100%) inhibition of pupae at a concentration of 100 ÂµL/0.25L of air displaying more toxic nature, whereas the concentration of TTEO required for 100% inhibition was found to be 80 ÂµL/0.25L of air displaying more toxic nature. With increased doses in fumigation assay the inhibition rate (IR) also increased in both the oils showing maximum deformities in adults. The higher proficiency (100% inhibition) in the contact toxicity method for pupicidal effect could be attributed to the collapse of the insect neural system, therefore causing instant and complete knockdown of the flies which was also reported by Kumar et al. [<a href="#CR10">10</a>] while testing the effect of crude oils from <i>E. globulus</i> and <i>M. piperita</i> on <i>M. domestica</i>. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig.Â 3</span></a></div>   <p>Percentage inhibition on pupal emergence due to Lemongrass (<b>a</b>), and Tea tree (<b>b</b>) essential oils against <i>M. domestica</i></p>   </div> <p /> <p id="Par22">Further, it was observed that LGEO is more effective on pupae as compared to TTEO causing adult deformation, shrinkage of wings and even producing pupal-adult intermediates (Fig.Â <a href="#Fig4">4</a>). However, such effects were also observed by Dimetry et al. [<a href="#CR20">20</a>] while examination of volatile oil from <i>P. nigra</i> on 3rd instar larvae of <i>M. domestica</i>. Some authors have observed that treatment of <i>T. vulgaris</i> and <i>Z. officinale</i> EOs on <i>C. albiceps</i> produces larval-pupal or pupal-adult intermediates with crumpled wings. The effect of EO from LG and TT are more promising than <i>C. aurantifolia</i> peels or <i>Citrus sinensis</i> which show only 70% fumigant effectiveness against houseflies [<a href="#CR21">21</a>]. The difference in efficacy between contact toxicity and fumigation assays may be due to the different percentage contributions of chemical components in two phases of oils. Further in the fumigation assay it was observed that % inhibition of house flies is dose dependent because the increased dose of EOs causes increase in % IR of pupae and increased chances of deformities in adult flies. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig.Â 4</span></a></div>   <p>Inhibition of pupal emergence into adults (<b>a</b>) caused by the essential oil treatment; (<b>b</b>) shows the deformation of adult undergoing emergence</p>   </div> <p /> </div> <div class="effectofeoonbiochemicalcomponentsoflarvalbody" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Effect of EO on Biochemical Components of Larval Body</div> <p id="Par23">Since the nutritional reserves like lipids, sugars and proteins are vital for proper growth and development of the insect we explored the impact of EOs on these metabolites in <i>M. domestica</i>. The LC<sub>50</sub> concentrations of EOs showed a notable influence on total body sugar, glycogen, lipid and protein content of third instar larvae. Comparably the LGEO exhibited high influence (reduction) over the total sugar, glycogen, and protein contents, whereas TTEO showed a significant effect on total lipid content in <i>M. domestica</i> larvae. The LGEO drastically reduced the total sugar, glycogen and protein contents by 3.29, 2.95 and 7.56 fold, respectively, while TTEO reduced the lipid content of larvae by 1.62 fold after treatment at LC<sub>50</sub> concentration for 24Â h (Fig.Â <a href="#Fig5">5</a>). Our inferences were consistent with the observations of Senthilkumar and his colleagues, [<a href="#CR22">22</a>] who reported a decrease in the concentration of proteins, lipids and carbohydrates by EOs. However, the reduction of glycogen and sugar content after treatment could be due to their involvement to combat the chemical stress imposed by the tested compounds. Hence, treatment with EOs might have possibly interrupted the metabolic processes and resulted in larval mortality [<a href="#CR7">7</a>]. The reduction of protein content by exposure to plant extracts is frequently reported in the literature. According to Shakoori and Saleem, [<a href="#CR23">23</a>] reduced level of proteins after treatment with EOs may be due to the breakdown of proteins into their amino acids, which help the insect for survival. Similarly, the reduced amount of sugar content in treated larvae of <i>M. domestica</i> could have occurred due to over exploitation of carbohydrate resources under stress conditions for proper maintenance of physiological metabolism. However, Khosravi et al. [<a href="#CR24">24</a>] stated that in <i>G. pyloalis</i>, sugar content is used to meet energy expenses for detoxification of <i>A. annua</i> extract which ultimately leads to exploitation of lipid contents of the body. Our results were in close agreement with the conclusions of Canavoso et al. [<a href="#CR25">25</a>] who detected reduction of lipids in the larvae of <i>S. littoralis</i> after treatment with lemon and garlic essential oils. The overall reduction in biochemical contents of the larvae due to EO treatment results in poor metabolism consequently leading to deformities or making the individuals prone to opportunistic diseases by pathogens as compared to normal larvae. Therefore, from the inferences of this test it can be concluded that tested EOs possess remarkable bioefficacy against nuisance causing pest i.e., house fly. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig.Â 5</span></a></div>   <p>Effect of EO treatment on the biochemical reserves of house fly, <i>M. domestica</i>.

Effect of EOs on Gut Enzymes of <i>M. domestica</i></div> <p id="Par24">The gut enzymes are key players for digestive physiology and health of all animals. Since house flies commonly dwell on sugary foods, their digestion mostly depends on amylases and glucosidases. Therefore, we determined the effect of EO on amylase and glucosidase activities in house fly larvae. Since some EOs are known to alter the digestive physiology of the insects, we investigated the effect of tested compounds on house fly larvae. However, we observed a significant difference in amylase activity between control and treated sets. The Î±-amylase activity was drastically reduced from 0.21 to 0.074â€‰Â±â€‰0.001 U/mg protein and 0.1064â€‰Â±â€‰0.004 U/mg protein (Fig.Â <a href="#Fig6">6</a>). Similarly, a considerable reduction of Î±- and Î²-glucosidase activities were observed after treatment with EOs. In Î±-glucosidase activity, LGEO proved to be more effective with a reasonable reduction from 2.45 U/mg of protein to 1.95â€‰Â±â€‰0.03 U/mg of protein followed by TTEO (2.37â€‰Â±â€‰0.07 U/mg of protein). However, in Î²-glucosidase activity, LG showed a higher effect, better than TTEO. The Î²-glucosidase activity was decreased from 3.06â€‰Â±â€‰0.07 U/mg of protein in control larvae to 2.65â€‰Â±â€‰0.04 U/mg of protein by LG and 2.75â€‰Â±â€‰0.02 U/mg of protein with TTEO. According to Mehrabadi et al. [<a href="#CR26">26</a>], if the action of the amylases is inhibited, it causes energy shortness, and ultimately death of the organism which supports our observations of larvicidal bioassay. The inhibition of Î±-amylase activity in the treated larvae could be a cytotoxic effect on epithelial cells of the insect midgut which synthesizes it. Further, the authors suggested that treatment with EO causes lysis of cell wall, damages cytoplasm and affects lipid and protein contents [<a href="#CR27">27</a>]. However, in the case of Î±- and Î²-glucosidase activities, our finding was consistent with previous reports where <i>H. rury</i> larvae treated with sub lethal concentrations of biopesticides showed reduction of Î±- and Î²-glucosidase activities. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig.Â 6</span></a></div>   <p>Effect of essential oil treatment on the activity of gut enzymes and acetylcholinesterase in <i>M. domestica</i>.

Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) Activity</div> <p id="Par25">The neurotransmitter AChE is pivotal for insects and higher animals. It plays a prominent role in cholinergic synapse in insects. The AChE elucidates the neurogenic toxicity of chemicals on insects, and in this study, it was observed that tested EOs displayed significant effect on acetylcholinesterase activity. Among the compounds, LGEO affected the neurotransmission by the inhibition of AChE activity to a greater extent (0.00288â€‰Â±â€‰0.0002 U/mg of Protein) followed by tea tree (0.00785â€‰Â±â€‰0.0005 U/mg of Protein) as compared to normal larvae (0.01134â€‰Â±â€‰0.0003 U/mg of protein). The inhibition of AChE is largely imparted by the presence of monoterpenes present in aromatic compounds like EOs [<a href="#CR27">27</a>]. These results are in line with our previous observations [<a href="#CR7">7</a>] where EO from <i>Laurus nobilis</i> showed higher inhibitory activity of AChE in <i>M. domestica.</i> There are several reports concluding that monoterpenoids and many plant volatiles cause insect mortality by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase enzyme [<a href="#CR28">28</a>].</p> </div> <div class="gcâ€" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
GCâ€"MS Analysis of EOs</div> <p id="Par26">Plants serve as a reservoir for many active compounds with distinguished properties which attributes to their commercial value. The EOs extracted from plants with characteristic aroma are composites of oxygenated terpenes, hydrocarbons and sesquiterpenes, which impart special economical significance to these secondary metabolites. Since EOs differ in their chemical composition therefore, characterization becomes an important process to decipher their different chemotypes. The GC-MS is an ideal technique for the qualitative and quantitative determination of volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds in EOs. These components in EO are frequently identified by comparison of their unique retention indices and characteristic mass spectra.</p> <p id="Par27">The GC-MS analysis of the LGEO revealed 12 major compounds which show the highest mass spectra ratios (Fig. S1). The major components present in the oil were Citral (37.48%) followed by Geranyl methanoate (26.88%), acetone (10.66%) and cyclobutane (4.58%) (Table S1). In case of TTEO, we observed 5 major compounds such as Terpinen-4-ol (45.78%)â€‰&amp;gt;â€‰Î³-terpinene (16.52%), &amp;gt;â€‰4-carene (8.75%), &amp;gt;â€‰Î²-Cymene (7.98%) followed by the least proportion of Î±-Terpineol (4.48%). Lemongrass is generally known to contain citral as a major component which is a complex of bioactive isomers like neral and geranial. Huynh, [<a href="#CR29">29</a>] reported that citral also known as 3, 7-dimethyl-2, 6-octadienal is a natural mixture of isomeric acyclic monoterpene aldehydes, i.e., geranial (transcitral, citral A) and neral (cis-citral, citral B). However, earlier researchers [<a href="#CR30">30</a>] have stated that TTEO contains 3 major constituents such as 4-terpineol, Î³-terpinene and Î±- terpinene, the distribution and abundance of these constituents in EOs depends on many factors such as genetic variations and geographical conditions of the plant species.</p> </div> <div class="fieldemissionscanningelectronmicroscopic(fesem)analysis" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopic (FESEM) Analysis</div> <p id="Par28">To have a clear visualization of the morphological alterations induced by EO treatment to the house fly larvae, the FESEM analysis evaluated the ultra-structural changes in the larval integument. The marked changes caused by EO treatment are shrinkage of body segments, along with withered anterior segments (Fig.Â <a href="#Fig7">7</a>). However, in case of control set where larvae were treated with acetone only, the body appearance was clear and smooth without any distorted structure. Like LG, the TTEO was also found to cause shrinkage and distortion of the larval body. Recently, Kumar et al. [<a href="#CR10">10</a>] also reported similar effects on surface morphology of <i>M. domestica</i> larvae due to treatment of <i>E. globules</i> EO. They further elucidated that <i>E. globulus</i> oil causes surface shrinkage at spinose rings with protruding intersegmental grooves. The surface aberration on insect larva could be caused due to absorption of plant extracts to the larval gut or by ingestion through the cuticle and gut epithelial cells. Similarly, Kumar et al. [<a href="#CR10">10</a>] also observed an effect on proliferation of spinose cells after treatment with EO. According to PÃ©rez-Serrano et al. [<a href="#CR30">30</a>] loss of integument organization is a result of stress responses to EO toxicity. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig.Â 7</span></a></div>   <p>The ultra-structural view of the alterations cause by essential oil treatment toÂ the surface of housefly larvae for 24Â h.

Taking into consideration, we determined the effect of LG and TTEOs on different forms of <i>M. domestica</i>. As evident from the observations, LG and TT oils showed potential bioefficacy against different life stages of the housefly. Since LG and TTEOs significantly reduced the metabolic contents and inhibited the enzymes like AChE, Î±-amylase, etc. the present study signposts the insecticidal repertoire of tested compounds for the sustainable management of houseflies. The inhibition of pupal emergence into adults together with larvicidal and adulticidal effects also suggest the formulation of these botanicals for potential industrial applications. The tested oils can thus be easily formulated as microemulsions or nanoemulsions in water or eco-friendly solvent systems. The microemulsions are known to enhance bioefficacy and provide long-term stability to the botanicals. Being volatile, the EOs can also be dissolved in solvents and kept at desired places inside buildings whereby they function as strong repellents for houseflies. In conclusion, LG and TTEOs could prove as important candidates for pest control strategy against houseflies due to their intrinsic larvicidal, pupicidal and adulticidal properties while LG may also act as an effective repellent and ovipositional deterrent for closely related species. However, for field trials and formulation of tested EOs a comprehensive understanding of their mechanism of action on model insect becomes imperative to avert the effects on non-target fauna. Therefore, our future perspective will be to characterize the transcriptome of <i>M. domestica</i> in response to EO treatment to better understand the mechanisms associated with their insecticidal activities.</p> </div> </div> <div class="conclusion" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Conclusion</div> <p id="Par30">To determine the insecticidal potential of EOs from LG and TT against <i>M. domestica</i> different experiments were carried out on different stages of the model insect. In most of the experiments, tested compounds showed significant effects for the control of <i>M. domestica.</i> In adulticidal and repellency assays, TTEO proved more effective than LGEO. In contrast, LGEO showed more potential as fumigant for (14.49 ÂµL/0.25 L of air) pupae of house fly. The present study concludes the significant efficacy of EOs under consideration against <i>M. domestica</i> which could be employed to breakdown its population below threshold levels to prevent the menace of some vector-borne diseases. The treatment of TTEO significantly decreased sugar, glycogen and lipid contents whereas LGEO highly affects the total protein content of <i>M. domestica.</i> A considerable reduction of Î±- and Î²- glucosidase activities was found in treated larvae as compared to the control. The above all findings of the present study brands TT and LGEOs as potential agents for eco-friendly management of houseflies under IPM program encouraging field trials.</p> </div> <div class="supplementary-material" title="supplementary-material"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
