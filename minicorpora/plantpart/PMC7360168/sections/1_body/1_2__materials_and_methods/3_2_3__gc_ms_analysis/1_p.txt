0: Three chromatographic analyses were performed, and the essential oil was analyzed on a Hewlett-Packard Gas Chromatograph Model 5890 coupled to a Hewlett-Packard Model 5971, equipped with a DB5 MS column (30amaAa0.25amm; 0.25a I14m), programming from 50AC (5amin) to 300AC at 5AC/min, with a 5-min hold.
1: The helium was used as the carrier gas (1.0amL/min); injection was in split mode (1:30); injector and detector temperatures were 250AC and 280AC, respectively.
2: The mass spectrometer worked in EI mode at 70aeV, electron multiplier at 2500aV, and ion source temperature at 180AC; MS data were acquired in the scan mode in the m/ z range 33a450.
