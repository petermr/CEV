0: Essential oil has been diluted by Tween 80 to 1% to have a concentration of 500amg/mL, and then the first 10 columns of the microplate are filled by the different concentrations of essential oil; from this solution, a series of A12 fold dilutions were prepared to obtain a concentration range between 500 and 1amg/mL.
1: On microplates, the negative control (column NA11) was chosen to fill the wells with 100a I14L sterile broth.
2: Positive control wells (column NA12) were filled with 100a I14L of the standardized microbial suspension at 10 5acfu/mL.
3: Then, the plates were incubated at 37AC for 24 hours [ 1].
