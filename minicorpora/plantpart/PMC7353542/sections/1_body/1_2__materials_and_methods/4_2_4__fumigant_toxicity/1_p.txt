0: The fumigant toxicity of  S. intermedia essential oil was tested on adults of  O. surinamensis,  R. dominica,  T. castaneum, and  T. granarium.
1: To determine the fumigant toxicity of the essential oil, filter papers (Whatman No.
2: 1, 2 A 2 cm) were impregnated with essential oil concentrations and were attached to the under surface of the screw cap of glass containers (340-mL) as fumigant chambers.
3: A series of concentrations (4.71a14.71, 7.06a20.88, 20.59a58.82, and 8.82a35.29 AL/L for  O. surinamensis,  R. dominica,  T. castaneum, and  T. granarium, respectively) was organized to assess the toxicity of  S. intermedia essential oil after an initial concentration setting experiment for each insect species.
4: Twenty unsexed adults (1a14 days old) of each insect species were separately put into glass containers and their caps were tightly affixed.
5: The same conditions without any essential oil concentration were used for control groups and each treatment was replicated five times.
6: Insects mortality was documented 24, 48 and 72 h after initial exposure to the essential oil.
7: Insects were considered dead when no leg or antennal movements were observed [ 31].
