0: The chemical profile of the  S. intermedia essential oil was evaluated using gas chromatography (Agilent 7890B) coupled with mass-spectrometer (Agilent 5977A).
1: The analysis was carried out by a HP-5 ms capillary column (30 m A 0.25 mm A 0.25 Am).
2: The temperature of the injector was 280 AC and the column temperature adjusted from 50 to 280 AC using the temperature program: 50 AC (hold for 1 min), increase to 100 AC at 8A/min, increase to 185 AC at 5A/min, increase to 280 AC at 15A/min, and hold at 280 AC for 2 min.
3: The carrier gas was helium (99.999%) with flow rate of 1 mL/min.
4: Essential oil was diluted in methanol, and 1 AL solution was injected (split 1:10 at 0.75 min).
5: The identification of components was performed by comparing mass spectral fragmentation patterns and retention indices with those reported in the databases [ 28, 29, 30].
