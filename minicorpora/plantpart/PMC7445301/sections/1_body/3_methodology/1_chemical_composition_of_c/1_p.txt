0: The major components of cedar wood essential oil were identified through GCaMS (Shimadzu QP 2010 74707 Plus) equipped with an FID and capillary column (0.32A mm i.d., length: 30A m, film thickness 0.25A Am).
1: Injection volume was 1A Al, oven temperature was programmed with 50A AC (hold time 5A min), which was increased at the rate of 10A AC/min to 300A AC (hold time 5A min).
2: Injection temperature was 250A AC, with a split ratio of 10.
3: The chemical constituents of oil were identified using GCaMS by comparing the individual mass spectra with the database of National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST12 or NIST62-) libraries.
