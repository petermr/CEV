0: Pectin nanoparticle was prepared via ionic gelation method using calcium chloride as cross-linker, a method described previously with slight modification 24.
1: Briefly, 1% solution of pectin was prepared, Tween 80 (5): Span80 (2) was added to the solution and was stirred in magnetic stirrer at 1500A ppm.
2: While stirring cedar wood oil was poured to the solution and it was further stirred for 10A min.
3: Finally 0.5% w/v added drop-wise as a cross-linker.
