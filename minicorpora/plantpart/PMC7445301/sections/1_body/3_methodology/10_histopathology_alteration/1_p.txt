0: To study the mode of action of cedar wood nanoencapsulated on larva, the treated dead larva of Anopheles was studied through histopathology.
1: The mortal larvae was removed from the treated solution and stored in buffered formalin reagent (pH 7.2).
2: The larva was dehydrated by passing through graded ethanol series and embedded in paraffin wax 67.
3: A thin longitudinal section (LS) of the larva stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (Hi-Media labs) was cut using microtome (Leica, Germany) and mounted on glass slide.
4: The LS of the midgut region were examined under an Upright Olympus microscope.
5: A setup containing tween, span and water served as control was also performed for reference.
