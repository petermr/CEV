        <span class="abst" title="Metabolic diseases like diabetes mellitus or dyslipidemia have a complex etiology characterized by the interference of genetic predisposition and environmental factors like diet or lifestyle. Over time they can cause significant vascular complications, leading to dysfunction or failure of key organs (brain, heart), with possible fatal consequences or a severe reduction of life quality. Although current authorized drugs may successfully control blood glucose or cholesterol level, their use is often associated with severe side effects, therefore the development of new drug candidates is necessary for a better management of metabolic diseases. Among potential new drug sources, aromatic plants rich in essential oils like &lt;i&gt;Melissa officinalis&lt;/i&gt; L., &lt;i&gt;Mentha x piperita&lt;/i&gt; L., &lt;i&gt;Cuminum cyminum&lt;/i&gt; L. or &lt;i&gt;Pistacia lentiscus&lt;/i&gt; L. var. &lt;i&gt;chia&lt;/i&gt; are very promising due to their diverse chemical composition and multiple mechanisms of action. This review describes a series of recent experimental studies investigating antidiabetic and hypolipemic effects of essential oils extracted from several aromatic plant species with an ethnopharmacological relevance in the Balkan peninsula. The pharmacological models used in the studies together with the putative mechanisms of action of the main constituents are also detailed. The presented data clearly sustain a potential administration of the studied essential oils for the prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases. Further research is needed in order to ascertain the therapeutic importance of these findings.">

The utilization of plant-derived essential oils as efficient bio-rational agents has been acknowledged in pest management strategies. In the present study, the fumigant toxicity of essential oil isolated from Satureja intermedia was assessed against cosmopolitan stored-product insect pests: Trogoderma granarium Everts (khapra beetle), Rhyzopertha dominica (Fabricius) (lesser grain borer), Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) (red flour beetle), and Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.) (saw-toothed grain beetle). The essential oil had significant fumigant toxicity against tested insects, which positively depended on essential oil concentrations and the exposure times. Comparative contact toxicity of S. intermedia essential oil was measured against Aphis nerii Boyer de Fonscolombe (oleander aphid) and its predator Coccinella septempunctata L. (seven-spot ladybird). Adult females of A. nerii were more susceptible to the contact toxicity than the C. septempunctata adults. The dominant compounds in the essential oil of S. intermedia were thymol (48.1%), carvacrol (11.8%), p-cymene (8.1%), and γ-terpinene (8.1%). The high fumigant toxicity against four major stored-product insect pests, the significant aphidicidal effect on A. nerii, and relative safety to the general predator C. septempunctata make terpene-rich S. intermedia essential oil a potential candidate for use as a plant-based alternative to the detrimental synthetic insecticides.">

Essential oils represent a green environmentally-friendly alternative to synthetic pesticides for controlling stored-product insect pests. &lt;i&gt;Launaea taraxacifolia&lt;/i&gt; is a leafy vegetable plant found in several parts of Nigeria. The leaves are eaten either fresh as a salad or cooked as a sauce. The essential oil obtained from fresh leaves of &lt;i&gt;L. taraxacifolia&lt;/i&gt; was obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Twenty-nine compounds were identified, accounting for 100% of the oil composition. The major component classes were monoterpene hydrocarbons (78.1%), followed by oxygenated monoterpenoids (16.2%), sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (2.1%), oxygenated sesquiterpenoids (0.3%), and non-terpenoid derivatives (3.3%). The leaf essential oil was dominated by monoterpene hydrocarbons including limonene (48.8%), sabinene (18.8%), and (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-β-ocimene (4.6%), along with the monoterpenoid aldehyde citronellal (11.0%). The contact insecticidal activity of &lt;i&gt;L. taraxacifolia&lt;/i&gt; essential oil against &lt;i&gt;Sitophilus oryzae&lt;/i&gt; was carried out; median lethal concentration (LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) values of topical exposure of &lt;i&gt;L. taraxacifolia&lt;/i&gt; essential oil were assessed over a 120-h period. The LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values ranged from 54.38 μL/mL (24 h) to 10.10 µL/mL (120 h). The insecticidal activity of the &lt;i&gt;L. taraxacifolia&lt;/i&gt; essential oil can be attributed to major components limonene (48.8%), sabinene (18.8%), and citronellal (11.0%), as well as potential synergistic action of the essential oil components.

However, flower essential oil was more toxic. A fetus exposed to essential oils tried to make the best of a bad situation and compensate essential oils harmful effects in the later life stages. Insect progeny production guarantee resulted in a trade-off between reproduction and female longevity. The insect also could alter fitness and reproductive behavior including, mating latency reduction, copulation duration increase, and copulation success rate raise in adulthood. Flower essential oil-exposed embryos were more successful in increasing copulation duration, and leaf essential oil-exposed embryos achieved more copulation success and less mating latency. These consequences persisted until F1 generation that was not directly exposed to essential oil. However, the F2 generation could concur with the harmful effects of essential oils.

Chemical induction is considered to be one of the promising methods to induce heartwood formation. However, to date no method has been proved effective for &lt;i&gt;D. odorifera&lt;/i&gt; as little is known about biochemical and physiological changes during heartwood development. Three potential heartwood induction substances &lt;i&gt;viz.&lt;/i&gt; acetic acid, sodium chloride, and hydrogen peroxide solutions were injected into the trunk of &lt;i&gt;D. odorifera&lt;/i&gt; to determine the effect on heartwood formation and physiological activity. Non-structural carbohydrates, lipids, wood properties, and essential oil were assessed in the post-treatment period. As also observed in the formation of natural heartwood, chemical-induced &lt;i&gt;Jiang Xiang&lt;/i&gt; production was accompanied by sapwood dehydration, non-structural carbohydrates consumption, and synthesis of heartwood substances. As the heartwood substances accumulated, basic density and essential oil content increased gradually, thereby &lt;i&gt;Jiang Xiang&lt;/i&gt; was finally produced. In this process, physiological parameters of discolored sapwood gradually evolved to resemble those of natural heartwood. Hydrogen peroxide-induced &lt;i&gt;Jiang Xiang&lt;/i&gt; was closest to natural heartwood, and the essential oil components met the standards for high-quality &lt;i&gt;Jiang Xiang&lt;/i&gt;, while the induction effects of acetic acid and sodium chloride were unsatisfactory. Thus, this study indicates that hydrogen peroxide has the potential to induce &lt;i&gt;Jiang Xiang&lt;/i&gt; production in &lt;i&gt;Dalbergia odorifera&lt;/i&gt;.">

However, the repeated use of synthetic pesticides has induced resistance in the vector pest along with undesirable impact on the environment. The biodegradability, non-persistent and user's safety are the root cause to prefer plant-derived pesticides to synthetic ones. The botanical based pesticides tend to degrade rapidly under the influence of several environmental factors. For the feasible application as pesticides, the plant products are formulated either as liquid or as purely solid. Despite well-established formulation technology in pesticide delivery, their handling trouble is being ignored. There is difficulty in liquid formulation of pesticide products, as they are prone to splashing and spillage, resulting in contamination, wastage and direct exposure to skin; whereas a solid formulation tends to produce dust. In the present work, cedarwood (Cedrus deodara) essential oil embedded pectin nanocapsules were produced. The nanocapsules were characterized according to their morphology, size, encapsulation efficiency and thermal stability. Furthermore, the nanocapsules were impregnated onto mini cotton tea bags to be employed as RTU (ready to use) formulation for treating the breeding sites of mosquitoes. The larvicidal activity of the bags treated with pectin-cedar wood nanocapsules was assessed against malaria vector, Anopheles culicifacies and 98% mortality was recorded till 4 weeks, this suggests its potential and hassle free applications in controlling mosquito vector.">

Pest management tactics are often based on the use of chemical insecticides, whereas environmentally-friendly control solutions are not available against this insect. The application of essential oils may provide effective protection against oviposition and subsequent larval damage. Oviposition deterrence of cinnamon, eucalyptus and lavender essential oils was tested on female &lt;i&gt;C. perspectalis&lt;/i&gt; in behavioural bioassays. Our results indicate that all the studied essential oils may be adequate deterrents; however, cinnamon oil exhibited the strongest effect. To determine the physiologically active compounds in the headspace of the essential oils, gas chromatography coupled with electroantennography recordings were performed in parallel with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify the volatile constituents. In addition, the release rates of various components from vial-wick dispensers were measured during the oviposition bioassay. These results may serve as a basis for the development of a practical and insecticide-free plant protection method against this invasive moth species.">

So, the present study aims to evaluate the insect repulsive and insecticidal power of &lt;i&gt;Ruta chalepensis&lt;/i&gt; L. essential oil (EO) from the region of Oulmes (Central plateau of Morocco); the ultimate objective is to develop a biological and ecological control strategy against pests. Thus, the EO obtained by hydrodistillation from the aerial parts of &lt;i&gt;Ruta chalepensis&lt;/i&gt; L. was identified by GC-MS; its repellent and fumigant toxicity effects on adults of &lt;i&gt;Tribolium castaneum&lt;/i&gt; Herbst were, respectively, investigated by the preferential area method on a filter paper and the inhalation test. The insecticide power was estimated by determining the percentage of mortality as a function of the duration of exposure and concentration of the EO. The essential oil obtained is characterized by the dominance of 2-undecanone (64.35%), piperonyl piperazine (11.9%), 2-decanaone (5.12%), 2-dodecanone (4.52%), decipidone (3.9%,) and 2-tridecanone (2.36%). This EO is endowed with a very repulsive power belonging to class V, which is strongly due to its majority compound 2-undecanone. The dose 0.038 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;l/ml gave a repellent power of 100% after 15 min. The tests also revealed a considerable insecticidal effect, which reached 100% after 48 hours at a dose of 0.62 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;l/ml. The calculation of the lethal dose causing 50% mortality (LD50) and the lethal times after which there is 50% mortality (LT50) allowed deducing that the insecticidal effect of &lt;i&gt;Ruta chalepensis&lt;/i&gt; L. is time- and dose-dependent. Hence, the effectiveness of &lt;i&gt;Ruta chalepensis&lt;/i&gt; L. EO attests that it can constitute a healthy alternative to fight against &lt;i&gt;Tribolium castaneum&lt;/i&gt; Herbst.">

Recently, the WHO Global Vector Control Response 2017-2030 (GVCR) programme reinforced its message for safer molluscicides as part of required strategies to strengthen vector control worldwide. Here, we present the essential oil from Eryngium triquetrum as a powerful product with molluscicide and parasiticide effect against S. mansoni and the snail intermediate host Biomphalaria glabrata.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;In the present study, we describe using several experimental approaches, the chemical composition of E. triquetrum essential oil extract and its biological effects against the snail B. glabrata and its parasite S. mansoni. Vector and the free-swimming larval stages of the parasite were exposed to different oil concentrations to determine the lethal concentration required to produce a mortality of 50% (LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) and 90% (LC&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt;). In addition, toxic activity of this essential oil was analyzed against embryos of B. glabrata snails by monitoring egg hatching and snail development. Also, short-time exposure to sublethal molluscicide concentrations on S. mansoni miracidia was performed to test a potential effect on parasite infectivity on snails. Mortality of miracidia and cercariae of S. mansoni is complete for 5, 1 and 0.5 ppm of oil extract after 1 and 4 h exposure.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The major chemical component found in E. triquetrum oil determined by GC-FID and GC/MS analyses is an aliphatic polyacetylene molecule, the falcarinol with 86.9-93.1% of the total composition. The LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; and LC&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt; values for uninfected snails were 0.61 and 1.02 ppm respectively for 24 h exposure. At 0.5 ppm, the essential oil was two times more toxic to parasitized snails with a mortality rate of 88.8 ± 4.8%. Moderate embryonic lethal effects were observed at the concentration of 1 ppm. Severe surface damage in miracidia was observed with a general loss of cilia that probably cause their immobility. Miracidia exposed 30 min to low concentration of plant extract (0.1 ppm) were less infective with 3.3% of prevalence compare to untreated with a prevalence of 44%.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Essential oil extracted from E. triquetrum and falcarinol must be considered as a promising product for the development of new interventions for schistosomiasis control and could proceed to be tested on Phase II according to the WHO requirements.">

        <span class="abst" title="Asarum heterotropoides Fr. var. mandshuricum (Maxim) Kitag (Chinese wild ginger) is an important medicinal herb. Essential oil extracted from its roots is the key ingredient and is mainly composed of phenylpropanoid compounds. As a skiophyte plant, light is a crucial factor for A. heterotropoides var. mandshuricum growth and metabolism. To investigate the effects of light irradiation on the essential oil biosynthesis in A. heterotropoides var. mandshuricum, the plants were cultivated in four light irradiation treatments (100, 50, 24 and 12% full sunlight). The photosynthetic capacity, essential oil content and composition, activities of several enzymes and levels of some secondary metabolites involved in the shikimic acid and cinnamic acid pathways were analyzed. The leaf mass per area, average diurnal net photosynthetic rate, and the essential oil content increased significantly with increasing light intensity. Phenylalanine, cinnamic acid, and p-coumaric acid in the cinnamic acid pathway were at their highest levels in plants cultivated in 100% full sunlight. The highest content of shikimic acid in the shikimic acid pathway was obtained in plants grown in 50% sunlight transmittance. The activity of the enzymes 3-Deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, cinnamate-4-hydroxylase and 4-coumarate:CoA ligase increased proportionally with light intensity. Overall, we conclude that high light irradiation promotes high net photosynthetic rate, high activity of enzymes and high amounts of phenylpropanoid precursor metabolites leading to significant biosynthesis of essential oil in A. heterotropoides var. mandshuricum.">

The aim of this study was to compare the composition and antimicrobial properties of essential oils obtained from leaves or flowers of this plant, collected from the Daran region of Iran during June 2018. The oils were obtained using Clevenger apparatus, their composition was evaluated by means of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and the antimicrobial properties were assayed by measuring inhibition halos, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). The yield of leaf oil was ~ 0.25% and that of flower oil was ~ 0.28%. Oil composition was affected by the part of the plants used: the most abundant bioactives contained in leaf essential oil were (+)-spathulenol (16.07%), 1,8-cineole (13.96%), trans-caryophyllene (9.58%), β-pinene (8.91%) and β-eudesmol (5.33%) and those in flower essential oil were caryophyllene oxide (35.47%), 1,8-cineole (9.54%), trans-caryophyllene (6.36%), β-eudesmol (4.11%), caryophyllenol-II (3.46%) and camphor (3.33%). Both the oils showed a significant inhibitory and lethal effect on the Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC ~ 16 µg/mL), Shigella dysenteriae and Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC ~ 62 µg/mL). Therefore, the essential oils obtained from both leaves and flowers of S. hydrangea may have potential application as bactericidal agents against some bacteria.">

Therefore, we evaluated the toxicity and the effects on host searching, oviposition, and probing and feeding behavior exerted on OSW by organic insecticides supposed to have limited side effects on environment and ecosystem services, i.e. sweet orange essential oil (EO), extract of Clitoria ternatea (CT), mineral oil, pyrethrin and azadirachtin. Despite none of the compounds caused a significant mortality of any of the OSW instars, we observed interesting effects on whitefly behavior: (i) EO and pyrethrin showed a relevant repellent effect, with impairment of both adults landing and oviposition on treated plants; (ii) CT and pyrethrin strongly affected probing behavior.

We could show that menthone disrupted microtubules and induced mortality linked with a rapid permeabilization (less than 15 min) of the plasma membrane. This mortality was elevated in a tubulin marker line, where microtubules are mildly stabilized.

This study aims to discuss the in vitro/in vivo scolicidal efficacy of different medicinal plants and their components used against Echinococcus granulosus. Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, PubMed and Scopus were used to retrieve the published literature from 2000-2020. A total of 62 published articles met the eligibility criteria and were reviewed. A total of 52 plant species belonging to 22 families have been reported to be evaluated as scolicidal agents against E. granulosus worldwide. Most extensively used medicinal plants against E. granulosus belong to the family Lamiaceae (25.0%) followed by Apiaceae (11.3%). Among various plant parts, leaves (36.0%) were most commonly used. Essential oils of Zataria multiflora and Ferula asafetida at a concentration of 0.02, and 0.06 mg/ml showed 100% in vitro scolicidal activity after 10 min post application, respectively. Z. multiflora also depicted high in vivo efficacy by decreasing weight and size while also causing extensive damage to the germinal layer of the cysts. Plant-based compounds like berberine, thymol, and thymoquinone have shown high efficacy against E. granulosus. These plant species and compounds could be potentially used for the development of an effective drug against E. granulosus, if further investigated for in vivo efficacy, toxicity, and mechanism of drug action in future research.">

        <span class="abst" title="(E)-β-caryophyllene (BCP) is a natural sesquiterpene hydrocarbon present in hundreds of plant species. BCP possesses several important pharmacological activities, ranging from pain treatment to neurological and metabolic disorders. These are mainly due to its ability to interact with the cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) and the complete lack of interaction with the brain CB1. A systematic analysis of plant species with essential oils containing a BCP percentage &gt; 10% provided almost 300 entries with species belonging to 51 families. The essential oils were found to be extracted from 13 plant parts and samples originated from 56 countries worldwide. Statistical analyses included the evaluation of variability in BCP% and yield% as well as the statistical linkage between families, plant parts and countries of origin by cluster analysis. Identified species were also grouped according to their presence in the Belfrit list. The survey evidences the importance of essential oil yield evaluation in support of the chemical analysis. The results provide a comprehensive picture of the species with the highest BCP and yield percentages.">

        <span class="abst" title="The extensive use of chemical pesticides leads to risks for both the environment and human health due to the toxicity and poor biodegradability that they may present. Farmers therefore need alternative agricultural practices including the use of natural molecules to achieve more sustainable production methods to meet consumer and societal expectations. Numerous studies have reported the potential of essential oils as biopesticides for integrated weed or pest management. However, their phytotoxic properties have long been a major drawback for their potential applicability (apart from herbicidal application). Therefore, deciphering the mode of action of essential oils exogenously applied in regards to their potential phytotoxicity will help in the development of biopesticides for sustainable agriculture. Nowadays, plant physiologists are attempting to understand the mechanisms underlying their phytotoxicity at both cellular and molecular levels using transcriptomic and metabolomic tools. This review systematically discusses the functional and cellular impacts of essential oils applied in the agronomic context. Putative molecular targets and resulting physiological disturbances are described. New opportunities regarding the development of biopesticides are discussed including biostimulation and defense elicitation or priming properties of essential oils.">

The tested EOs and the Tve extract caused a significant inhibition of bacterial growth, with very promising MBC (minimum bactericidal concentration) and MIC90 (minimum inhibitory concentration causing a 90% growth inhibition) values. Moreover, an in vivo germination test showed no major reduction in seed germination when the substances were applied as seed treatment. A rapid molecular screening method has been developed, through real-time PCR, for the specific quantification of Cmm in the presence of a vegetable matrix to test in vivo the antimicrobial efficacy of oregano and cinnamon oil on seed treatment without resorting to whole plant essays, which are time- and space-consuming.">

Bergamot and sweet orange are rich in nutritional and functional components, which exhibit antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic effect. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential effect of bergamot and sweet orange (juice and essential oil) on acne vulgaris caused by excessive secretion of androgen. Eighty male golden hamsters were randomly divided into 10 groups and received low or high dose of bergamot and sweet orange juice and essential oil, physiological saline, and positive drugs for four weeks, respectively. Results showed that all interventions could improve acne vulgaris by reducing the growth rate of sebaceous gland spots, inhibiting TG accumulation, decreasing the release of inflammatory cytokines (notably reducing IL-1&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; levels), promoting apoptosis in the sebaceous gland, and decreasing the ratio of T/E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Among them, bergamot and orange essential oil may have better effects (dose dependent) on alleviating acne vulgaris than the corresponding juice. In view of the large population of acne patients and the widespread use of sweet orange and bergamot, this study is likely to exert an extensive and far-reaching influence.">

It is a species known as a medicinal plant in Europe and also in West Asia and North America. The raw material obtained from this species is &lt;i&gt;Absinthii herba&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Artemisiae absinthii aetheroleum.&lt;/i&gt; The main substances responsible for the biological activity of the herb are: the essential oil, bitter sesquiterpenoid lactones, flavonoids, other bitterness-imparting compounds, azulenes, phenolic acids, tannins and lignans. In the official European medicine, the species is used in both allopathy and homeopathy. In the traditional Asian and European medicine, it has been used as an effective agent in gastrointestinal ailments and also in the treatment of helminthiasis, anaemia, insomnia, bladder diseases, difficult-to-heal wounds, and fever. Today, numerous other directions of biological activity of the components of this species have been demonstrated and confirmed by scientific research, such as antiprotozoal, antibacterial, antifungal, anti-ulcer, hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, cytotoxic, analgesic, neuroprotective, anti-depressant, procognitive, neurotrophic, and cell membrane stabilizing and antioxidant activities. &lt;i&gt;A. absinthium&lt;/i&gt; is also making a successful career as a cosmetic plant. In addition, the importance of this species as a spice plant and valuable additive in the alcohol industry (famous absinthe and vermouth-type wines) has not decreased. The species has also become an object of biotechnological research.">

Seed oils of six populations were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatograph/mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The HPLC analysis indicated that &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;harmala&lt;/i&gt; seed oil exhibited a very high level of tocopherol contents, with values in the range of 2385.66-2722.68 mg/100 g. The most abundant tocopherol isomer was δ-tocopherol (90.39%), followed by γ-tocopherol (8.08%) and α-tocopherol (1.14%). We discovered for the first time the presence of tocotrenols in &lt;i&gt;P. harmala&lt;/i&gt; seed oils of the six populations studied. The GC-MS analyses revealed that linoleic acid was the main fatty acid (65.17%), followed by oleic acid (23.12%), palmitic acid (5.36%) and stearic acid (3.08%). We also studied the antifungal activity of seed oil of the Medenine (MD) population on ten fungal pathogens. The antifungal effects differed among pathogens and depended on oil concentrations. Seed oil of the MD population caused a significant decrease in mycelial growth of all fungi tested, with values ranging 31.50-82.11%, except for &lt;i&gt;Alternaria&lt;/i&gt; sp., which showed no inhibition. The antifungal activity against the 10 selected fungi can be explained by the richness in tocols of the extracted oil and make &lt;i&gt;P. harmala&lt;/i&gt; a promising crop for biological control. Furthermore, the importance of fatty acids and the wide geographic spread in Tunisia of this species make this crop a potential source of renewable energy.">

(common mugwort) is a species with great importance in the history of medicine and was called the &quot;mother of herbs&quot; in the Middle Ages. It is a common herbaceous plant that exhibits high morphological and phytochemical variability depending on the location where it occurs. This species is well known almost all over the world. Its herb-&lt;i&gt;Artemisiae vulgaris herba&lt;/i&gt;-is used as a raw material due to the presence of essential oil, flavonoids, and sesquiterpenoids lactones and their associated biological activities. The European Pharmacopoeia has listed this species as a potential homeopathic raw material. Moreover, this species has been used in traditional Chinese, Hindu, and European medicine to regulate the functioning of the gastrointestinal system and treat various gynecological diseases. The general aim of this review was to analyze the progress of phytochemical and pharmacological as well as professional scientific studies focusing on &lt;i&gt;A. vulgaris&lt;/i&gt;. Thus far, numerous authors have confirmed the beneficial properties of &lt;i&gt;A. vulgaris&lt;/i&gt; herb extracts, including their antioxidant, hepatoprotective, antispasmolytic, antinociceptive, estrogenic, cytotoxic, antibacterial, and antifungal effects. In addition, several works have reviewed the use of this species in the production of cosmetics and its role as a valuable spice in the food industry. Furthermore, biotechnological micropropagation of &lt;i&gt;A. vulgaris&lt;/i&gt; has been analyzed.">

        <span class="abst" title="Mosquito-borne infectious diseases are a persistent problem in tropical regions of the world, including Southeast Asia. Vector control has relied principally on synthetic insecticides, but these have detrimental environmental effects and there is an increasing demand for plant-based agents to control insect pests. Invasive weedy plant species may be able to serve as readily available sources of essential oils, some of which may be useful as larvicidal agents for control of mosquito populations. We hypothesize that members of the genus &lt;i&gt;Conyza&lt;/i&gt; (Asteraceae) may produce essential oils that may have mosquito larvicidal properties. The essential oils from the aerial parts of &lt;i&gt;Conyza bonariensis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;C. canadensis&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;C. sumatrensis&lt;/i&gt; were obtained by hydrodistillation, analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and screened for mosquito larvicidal activity against &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Ae. albopictus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Culex quinquefasciatus&lt;/i&gt;. The essential oils of &lt;i&gt;C. canadensis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C. sumatrensis&lt;/i&gt;, both rich in limonene (41.5% and 25.5%, respectively), showed notable larvicidal activities against &lt;i&gt;Ae. aegypti&lt;/i&gt; (24-h LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 9.80 and 21.7 μg/mL, respectively) and &lt;i&gt;Ae. albopictus&lt;/i&gt; (24-h LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 18.0 and 19.1 μg/mL, respectively).

        <span class="abst" title="Hemp (&lt;i&gt;Cannabis sativa&lt;/i&gt; L.) is currently one of the most controversial and promising crops. This study compared nine wild hemp (&lt;i&gt;C. sativa&lt;/i&gt; spp. &lt;i&gt;spontanea&lt;/i&gt; V.) accessions with 13 registered cultivars, eight breeding lines, and one cannabidiol (CBD) hemp strain belonging to &lt;i&gt;C. sativa&lt;/i&gt; L. The first three groups had similar main essential oil (EO) constituents, but in different concentrations; the CBD hemp had a different EO profile. The concentration of the four major constituents in the industrial hemp lines and wild hemp accessions varied as follows: β-caryophyllene 11-22% and 15.4-29.6%; α-humulene 4.4-7.6% and 5.3-11.9%; caryophyllene oxide 8.6-13.7% and 0.2-31.2%; and humulene epoxide 2, 2.3-5.6% and 1.2-9.5%, respectively. The concentration of CBD in the EO of wild hemp varied from 6.9 to 52.4% of the total oil while CBD in the EO of the registered cultivars varied from 7.1 to 25%; CBD in the EO of the breeding lines and in the CBD strain varied from 6.4 to 25% and 7.4 to 8.8%, respectively. The concentrations of δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in the EO of the three groups of hemp were significantly different, with the highest concentration being 3.5%. The EO of wild hemp had greater antimicrobial activity compared with the EO of registered cultivars. This is the first report to show that significant amounts of CBD could be accumulated in the EO of wild and registered cultivars of hemp following hydro-distillation. The amount of CBD in the EO can be greater than that in the EO of the USA strain used for commercial production of CBD. Furthermore, this is among the first reports that show greater antimicrobial activity of the EO of wild hemp vs. the EO of registered cultivars. The results suggest that wild hemp may offer an excellent opportunity for future breeding and the selection of cultivars with a desirable composition of the EO and possibly CBD-rich EO production.">

The total phenolic and flavonoid contents and phenolic compounds profile analyzed spectrophotometrically and by high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC), respectively, were evaluated in the developed tinctures. The results showed that the tinctures prepared from the &lt;i&gt;S. montana&lt;/i&gt; herb by maceration or remaceration are rich in polyphenols, and there is an influence of the technological factors (particle size and extraction mode) on the total phenolic and flavonoid contents.

Thus, the high contents of polyphenols and flavonoids in the developed tinctures and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-thymol among the volatile components of the &lt;i&gt;S. montana&lt;/i&gt; essential oil could indicate the promising antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of these herbal preparations.

        <span class="abst" title="(1) Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and the imposition of strict but necessary measures to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus have been, and still are, major stress factors for adults, children, and adolescents. Stress harms human health as it creates free radicals in the human body. According to various recent studies, volatile oils from various aromatic plants have a high content of antioxidants and antimicrobial compounds. An external supply of antioxidants is required to destroy these free radicals. The main purpose of this paper is to create a yoghurt with high antioxidant capacity, using only raw materials from Romania; (2) Methods: The bioactive components used to enrich the cow milk yoghurt were extracted as volatile oils out of four aromatic plants: basil, mint, lavender and fennel. Initially, the compounds were extracted to determine the antioxidant capacity, and subsequently, the antioxidant activity of the yoghurt was determined. The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhy-drazyl (DPPH) method was used to determine the antioxidant activity; (3) Results: The results show that cow milk yoghurt enhanced with volatile oils of basil, lavender, mint and fennel, encapsulated in sodium alginate has an antioxidant and antimicrobial effect as a staple food with multiple effects in increasing the body's immunity. The antioxidant activity proved to be considerably higher than the control sample. The highest antioxidant activity was obtained on the first day of the analysis, decreasing onwards to measurements taken on days 10 and 20. The cow milk yoghurt enriched with volatile basil oil obtained the best results; (4) Conclusions: The paper shows that yoghurts with a high antioxidant capacity were obtained, using only raw materials from Romania. A healthy diet, compliance with safety conditions and finding appropriate and safe methods to increase the body's immunity is a good alternative to a major transition through harder times, such as pandemics. The creation of food products that include natural antioxidant compounds combines both the current great possibility of developing food production in Romania and the prevention and reduction of the effects caused by pandemic stress in the human body.">

Metagenomic sequencing was performed with the aim to investigate changes of microbial communities in ileum, caecum, and colon. The results demonstrated that the combination of essential oils was non cytotoxic, and had a positive effect on the microbial composition in the large intestine of pigs due to significant increase in the number of probiotic bacteria. The amount of &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; was 2.5 times and &lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/i&gt; 1.9 times higher in the animal group fed with supplement.

        <span class="abst" title="Mosquito-borne diseases are a large problem in Vietnam as elsewhere. Due to environmental concerns regarding the use of synthetic insecticides as well as developing insecticidal resistance, there is a need for environmentally-benign alternative mosquito control agents. In addition, resistance of pathogenic microorganisms to antibiotics is an increasing problem. As part of a program to identify essential oils as alternative larvicidal and antimicrobial agents, the leaf, stem, and rhizome essential oils of several &lt;i&gt;Zingiber&lt;/i&gt; species, obtained from wild-growing specimens in northern Vietnam, were acquired by hydrodistillation and investigated using gas chromatography. The mosquito larvicidal activities of the essential oils were assessed against &lt;i&gt;Culex quinquefasciatus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Aedes albopictus&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Ae. aegypti&lt;/i&gt;, and for antibacterial activity against a selection of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and for activity against &lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Zingiber&lt;/i&gt; essential oils rich in α-pinene and β-pinene showed the best larvicidal activity. &lt;i&gt;Zingiber nudicarpum&lt;/i&gt; rhizome essential oil showed excellent antibacterial activity against &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus faecalis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Bacillus cereus&lt;/i&gt;, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 2, 8, and 1 μg/mL, respectively. However, the major components, α-pinene and β-pinene, cannot explain the antibacterial activities obtained.">

To our best knowledge, there are few studies on oregano grown in the arid Andes region, but none on the metabolites produced and their bioactivity. This work identified fifty metabolites by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS)-monoterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated monoterpenes, phenolic monoterpenes, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, and oxygenated sesquiterpenes-present in the essential oil of oregano collected in the Atacama Desert. The main components of essential oregano oil were thymol (15.9%), &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-sabinene hydrate (13.4%), γ-terpinene (10.6%), &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-cymene (8.6%), linalyl acetate (7.2%), sabinene (6.5%), and carvacrol methyl ether (5.6%). The antibacterial tests showed that the pathogenic bacteria &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt; and the phytopathogenic bacteria &lt;i&gt;Erwinia rhapontici&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Xanthomonas campestris&lt;/i&gt; were the most susceptible to oregano oil, with the lowest concentrations of oil necessary to inhibit their bacterial growth. Moreover, oregano oil showed antibacterial activity against bacteria associated with food poisoning. In conclusion, &lt;i&gt;O. vulgare&lt;/i&gt; from the arid Andean region possesses an important antibacterial activity with a high potential in the food industry and agriculture.">

        <span class="abst" title="Thymus albicans is an endemic species of the Iberian Peninsula with a vulnerable conservation status. In an attempt to contribute to the valorization of this species, the present study brings new insights on the antifungal and anti-inflammatory mechanism of action of T. albicans essential oil. The antifungal activity of the oil and its major compounds was assessed for the first time against standard and clinically isolated strains of yeasts and filamentous fungi. The effect on the two major virulence factors of Candida albicans (germ tube formation and biofilm disruption) was considered in more detail. At 0.08 μL/mL, the oil inhibited C. albicans germ tube formation by more than 40% and decreased biofilm biomass at MIC values, thus pointing out its antivirulent potential. The anti-inflammatory activity of the essential oil was investigated on LPS-stimulated mouse macrophages (RAW 264.7) by evaluating the levels of several pro-inflammatory mediators, namely nitric oxide (NO), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). T. albicans oil reduced the production of nitrites, a NO derived sub-product, at non-cytotoxic concentrations of 0.32 and 0.64 μL/mL, by 27 and 41%, respectively. In addition, the iNOS protein levels of essential oil pre-treated cells were reduced by 14%. Overall, the high essential oil yield of T. albicans as well as its bioactive effects at concentrations without cytotoxicity, encourage further studies on the potential pharmacological applications of this species. Furthermore, these results raise awareness for the need to preserve endangered species that may hold relevant medicinal value.">

CKEO, in comparison to its major constituent, geraniol, showed better MICs against tested pathogens. In combination studies, the effective concentrations of CKEO and streptomycin were reduced from 20 to 5 μg/mL and 11 to 0.7 ng/mL against E. coli. This suggests their synergistic action. However, CKEO showed partial synergy with ciprofloxacin. To understand the efficacy of CKEO, time-kill kinetics was performed. CKEO took the half time to show the bactericidal effect in comparison to streptomycin at their 2x MICs (double the MIC), while their combination took only 30 min for this. Fluorescence and surface electron microscopic and protein estimation studies suggested the multi-target action of CKEO-streptomycin combination against E. coli. Further, CKEO alone/in combination exhibited less than 10% haemolytic activity at its MIC.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;These results indicate that CKEO is a potentially safe alternative for the treatment of various pathogenic bacterial strains. It could be used for a variety of applications including human health, food storage, aquaculture, etc.">

One hundred and eighteen compounds were globally identified in the various genotypes. However, α-pinene, limonene, 1,8-cineole, α-terpineol, and linalool always resulted as main components with few differences among samples. Minor compounds have been the determining factors in differentiating or associating genotypes in the outputs of a principal component analysis (PCA), where the results of another analysis of fruit essential oils of the same genotypes were also jointly used.

To explore their potential, it is important to bring these remedies out of historical treatises, and into present-day scientific evaluation. Using an example of Indian traditional medicine (Ayurveda), we present a perspective toward evaluating historical remedies for anti-biofilm potential. Across compendia, we identified three plant-based remedies (of &lt;i&gt;Kalanchoe pinnata&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cynodon dactylon&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Ocimum tenuiflorum&lt;/i&gt;) recommended for wounds. The remedies were reconstituted in accordance with historical practices, and tested for their effects on biofilm formation and eradication assays of wound pathogens, &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;. Based on our approach and the results obtained, we provide insights into the considerations and challenges related to identifying potential remedies in historical texts, and testing them in the laboratory with standard biofilm assays. We believe this will be relevant for future studies exploring anti-biofilm approaches at the interface of historical medicine and present-day scientific practices.">

        <span class="abst" title="Little is known about the pharmacological activity of &lt;i&gt;Monarda fistulosa&lt;/i&gt; L. essential oils. To address this issue, we isolated essential oils from the flowers and leaves of &lt;i&gt;M. fistulosa&lt;/i&gt; and analyzed their chemical composition. We also analyzed the pharmacological effects of &lt;i&gt;M. fistulosa&lt;/i&gt; essential oils on transient receptor potential (TRP) channel activity, as these channels are known targets of various essential oil constituents. Flower (MEO&lt;sub&gt;Fl&lt;/sub&gt;) and leaf (MEO&lt;sub&gt;Lv&lt;/sub&gt;) essential oils were comprised mainly of monoterpenes (43.1% and 21.1%) and oxygenated monoterpenes (54.8% and 77.7%), respectively, with a high abundance of monoterpene hydrocarbons, including &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-cymene, γ-terpinene, α-terpinene, and α-thujene. Major oxygenated monoterpenes of MEO&lt;sub&gt;Fl&lt;/sub&gt; and MEO&lt;sub&gt;Lv&lt;/sub&gt; included carvacrol and thymol. Both MEO&lt;sub&gt;Fl&lt;/sub&gt; and MEO&lt;sub&gt;Lv&lt;/sub&gt; stimulated a transient increase in intracellular free Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration ([Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) in TRPA1 but not in TRPV1 or TRPV4-transfected cells, with MEO&lt;sub&gt;Lv&lt;/sub&gt; being much more effective than MEO&lt;sub&gt;Fl&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, the pure monoterpenes carvacrol, thymol, and β-myrcene activated TRPA1 but not the TRPV1 or TRPV4 channels, suggesting that these compounds represented the TRPA1-activating components of &lt;i&gt;M. fistulosa&lt;/i&gt; essential oils. The transient increase in [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; induced by MEO&lt;sub&gt;Fl&lt;/sub&gt;/MEO&lt;sub&gt;Lv&lt;/sub&gt;, carvacrol, β-myrcene, and thymol in TRPA1-transfected cells was blocked by a selective TRPA1 antagonist, HC-030031. Although carvacrol and thymol have been reported previously to activate the TRPA1 channels, this is the first report to show that β-myrcene is also a TRPA1 channel agonist. Finally, molecular modeling studies showed a substantial similarity between the docking poses of carvacrol, thymol, and β-myrcene in the binding site of human TRPA1. Thus, our results provide a cellular and molecular basis to explain at least part of the therapeutic properties of these essential oils, laying the foundation for prospective pharmacological studies involving TRP ion channels.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;With declining wild fish populations, farmed salmon has gained popularity as a source for healthy long-chain highly unsaturated fatty acids (LC-HUFA). However, the introduction of plant oil in farmed salmon feeds has reduced the content of these beneficial LC-HUFA. The synthetic capability for LC-HUFAs depends upon the dietary precursor fatty acids and the genetic potential, thus there is a need for in-depth understanding of LC-HUFA synthetic genes and their interactions with other genes involved in lipid metabolism. Several key genes of LC-HUFA synthesis in salmon belong to the fatty acid desaturases 2 (fads2) family. The present study applied whole transcriptome analysis on two CRISPR-mutated salmon strains (crispants), 1) Δ6abc/5&lt;sup&gt;Mt&lt;/sup&gt; with mutations in Δ5fads2, Δ6fads2-a, Δ6fads2-b and Δ6fads2-c genes, and 2) Δ6bc&lt;sup&gt;Mt&lt;/sup&gt; with mutations in Δ6fads2-b and Δ6fads2-c genes. Our purpose is to evaluate the genetic effect fads2 mutations have on other lipid metabolism pathways in fish, as well as to investigate mosaicism in a commercial species with a very long embryonal period.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Both Δ6abc/5&lt;sup&gt;Mt&lt;/sup&gt; and Δ6bc&lt;sup&gt;Mt&lt;/sup&gt; crispants demonstrated high percentage of indels within all intended target genes, though different indel types and percentage were observed between individuals. The Δ6abc/5&lt;sup&gt;Mt&lt;/sup&gt; fish displayed several disruptive indels which resulted in over 100 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) enriched in lipid metabolism pathways in liver. This includes up-regulation of srebp1 genes which are known key transcription regulators of lipid metabolism as well as a number of down-stream genes involved in fatty acid de-novo synthesis, fatty acid β-oxidation and lipogenesis. Both elovl5 and elovl2 genes were not changed, suggesting that the genes were not targeted by Srebp1. The mutation of Δ6bc&lt;sup&gt;Mt&lt;/sup&gt; surprisingly resulted in over 3000 DEGs which were enriched in factors encoding genes involved in mRNA regulation and stability.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;CRISPR-Cas9 can efficiently mutate multiple fads2 genes simultaneously in salmon. The results of the present study have provided new information on the transcriptional regulations of lipid metabolism genes after reduction of LC-HUFA synthesis pathways in salmon.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Heracleum persicum&lt;/i&gt;, commonly named Persian hogweed, is a principal native medicinal plant in Iran. Collecting &lt;i&gt;H. persicum&lt;/i&gt; at the most appropriate growing stage is the key factor to achieve the high phytochemical quality to meet consumer's needs. In the present experiment, the aerial parts of this plant were harvested at up to six different developmental stages during the growing season to determine the phytochemical profiles. Our results indicated that the highest essential oil content was obtained in the mid-mature seed stage (3.5%). The most elevated extract content was recorded in the floral budding stage (10.4%). In the vegetative stage, limonene (18.1%), in floral budding stage, caryophyllene (14.1%), anethole (14.6%), and β-bisabolene (12.7%), in the full flowering stage, myristicin (15.0%), and hexyl butyrate (9.1%), in the early development of seeds stage, hexyl butyrate (32.1%), and octyl acetate (11.7%), in the mid-mature seeds stage hexyl butyrate (38.8%), octyl acetate (14.5%), in the late-mature/ripe seeds stage, hexyl butyrate (23.6%), and octyl acetate (10.5%) are recorded as the main components. The highest phenolic acids content was obtained in the floral budding stage (287.40 mg/g dried extract). The analysis of phenolic acids demonstrated cinnamic acid (8.0-225.3 mg/g extract), p-coumaric acid (1.7-39.2 mg/g extract), p-hydroxybenzoic acid (0.8-16.8 mg/g extract), and ferulic acid (2.4-15.8 mg/g extract) as the main phenolic acids. Cinnamic acid was found as the major phenolic compound in the vegetative stage following by floral budding, the full flowering stage, the early development of seeds, and late-mature/ripe seeds stages. P-coumaric acid was the most abundant phenolic compounds in the mid-mature seeds stage. In this regard, the harvest time of &lt;i&gt;H. persicum&lt;/i&gt; aerial parts can be selected to achieve the highest secondary metabolites of interest. The results of this study can be used as a guideline for grower to obtain the highest possible amount of desirable metabolites, beneficial in both food and pharmaceutical industries as well as their undeniable economical benefits.">

Although the essential oils obtained from &lt;i&gt;C. camphora&lt;/i&gt; have been widely used in pharmaceutical, medicinal, perfume, and food industries, the molecular mechanisms underlying terpenoid biosynthesis are poorly understood. To address this lack of knowledge, we performed transcriptome analysis to investigate the key regulatory genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis in &lt;i&gt;C. camphora&lt;/i&gt;. High-oil-yield trees of linalool type and low-oil-yield trees were used to assemble a &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; transcriptome of &lt;i&gt;C. camphora&lt;/i&gt;. A total of 121,285 unigenes were assembled, and the total length, average length, N50, and GC content of unigenes were 87,869,987, 724, 1,063, and 41.1%, respectively. Comparison of the transcriptome profiles of linalool-type &lt;i&gt;C. camphora&lt;/i&gt; with trees of low oil yield resulted in a total of 3,689 differentially expressed unigenes, among them 31 candidate genes had annotations associated with metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides, including four in the monoterpenoid biosynthesis pathway and three in the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway. Collectively, this genome-wide transcriptome provides a valuable tool for future identification of genes related to essential oil biosynthesis. Additionally, the identification of a cohort of genes in the biosynthetic pathways of terpenoids provides a theoretical basis for metabolic engineering of essential oils in &lt;i&gt;C. camphora&lt;/i&gt;.">

The elucidated factors affecting the composition of Mentha essential oils are fertilization, drying conditions, mechanical impedance, NaCl stress, and Gamma irradiation. Investigation of the activities of the Mentha species showed that the main interest was dedicated to addressing the antibacterial effect towards gram+ and gram- bacteria. Essential oils of Mentha species exhibited antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant, insecticidal, licidal, niticidal, allelopathic, antidiabetic, derma-protective, and anticorrosive activities. The ethnobotanical surveys revealed that Mentha species are used in seven regions: Tafilalet, High Atlas, Fez-Boulemane, Taounat, Oujda, Ouazzane, and Rabat. By calculating the Jaccard index, the highest degree of similarity was found between Tafilalet, Rabat, and Oujda regions. The wide use of the Mentha species in Morocco highlights the high ethnobotanical value of the genus.">

The multiplication of plantlets was conducted through shoot tips that exhibited potent apical growth and regeneration capacities on basal medium (BM), without the addition of any plant growth regulators (PGRs). PGRs were also omitted for the establishment and cultivation of tansy root cultures. Both abaxial and adaxial leaf surfaces of in vitro micropropagated plantlets were covered with glandular biseriate trichomes. Histochemical staining showed that glandular secretions were rich in lipid and terpene compounds, confirmed by GC-MS analysis of essential oil (EO). In the total EO, similar portions of oxygenated monoterpenes (38.5% m/m) and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (22.6% m/m) were detected. Chemical profiles of methanol extracts of in vitro cultured tansy shoots and roots varied in quantity and quality from those obtained from wild-growingtansy. HPLC analysis indicated that the methanol extracts of in vitro cultured roots were the richest in 3,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid (3,5-O-DCQA), in which the concentration was 6 times higher (10.220 mg/g DW) than that in the extract obtained from roots of wild-growing tansy (1.684 mg/g DW). This result is noticeable in the manner of industrial production of biologically active 3,5-O-DCQA that has been shown to have antioxidant, hepatoprotective, antiviral, antimutagenic, and immunomodulatory activity. Biotechnological interventions on secondary metabolite production taking place in trichomes could further enhance the production of some important tansy metabolites and further investigation will be directed toward the elucidation of the pharmaceutical potential of tansy in vitro obtained metabolites, as mixtures or single moieties.">

        <span class="abst" title="Plastic, usually derived from non-renewable sources, is among the most used materials in food packaging. Despite its barrier properties, plastic packaging has a recycling rate below the ideal and its accumulation in the environment leads to environmental issues. One of the solutions approached to minimize this impact is the development of food packaging materials made from polymers from renewable sources that, in addition to being biodegradable, can also be edible. Different biopolymers from agricultural renewable sources such as gelatin, whey protein, starch, chitosan, alginate and pectin, among other, have been analyzed for the development of biodegradable films. Moreover, these films can serve as vehicles for transporting bioactive compounds, extending their applicability as bioactive, edible, compostable and biodegradable films. Biopolymer films incorporated with plant-derived bioactive compounds have become an interesting area of research. The interaction between environment-friendly biopolymers and bioactive compounds improves functionality. In addition to interfering with thermal, mechanical and barrier properties of films, depending on the properties of the bioactive compounds, new characteristics are attributed to films, such as antimicrobial and antioxidant properties, color and innovative flavors. This review compiles information on agro-based biopolymers and plant-derived bioactive compounds used in the production of bioactive films. Particular emphasis has been given to the methods used for incorporating bioactive compounds from plant-derived into films and their influence on the functional properties of biopolymer films. Some limitations to be overcome for future advances are also briefly summarized. This review will benefit future prospects for exploring innovative methods of incorporating plant-derived bioactive compounds into films made from agricultural polymers.">

The current major tool to manage fire ants are synthetic insecticides that are used largely as stomach poisons in bait products or contact insecticides in spray, broadcast, drench, and dust products for area and nest treatments. In addition to these insecticide products, repellants and fumigants can also be useful in some unique scenarios. The ever-increasing public concern about the potential adverse effects of synthetic insecticides on health and the environment has been a driving force for searching for safer alternatives to control fire ants. Tremendous effort has been made in developing biologically-based control for managing fire ants; however, natural products continue to be one of the most attractive sources of safe alternatives to synthetic insecticides. Here, we summarized the synthetic insecticides that are currently used in managing fire ants, available alternative products in the current market, and academic efforts in searching for fire ant natural toxins, repellants and fumigants.">

Using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), the principal components were methyleugenol (41.31%) and eugenol (33.95%), followed by (E)-caryophyllene (5.65%), &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-cymene-8-ol (3.50%), 1,8-cineole (2.94%), and α-terpinolene (1.41%). Results showed similar scavenging activity via 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl DPPH radical scavenging activity (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 110.00 ± 0.08 μg/mL), as well as very potent antioxidant activity against both ferric reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP) (106.00 ± 0.11 μg/mL) and β-carotene bleaching (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 315.00 ± 2.08 μg/mL) assays when compared to positive butylated hydroxytoluene and ascorbic acid. The molecular docking approach has also been performed to screen the antioxidant activities of the major and potent compounds against human protein target peroxiredoxin 5. Results showed good binding profiles and attributed the strongest inhibitory activity to β-caryophyllene oxide (-5.8 kcal/mol), followed respectively by isocembrol and α-selinene (-5.4 kcal/mol), and viridiflorol (-5.1 kcal/mol). Furthermore, ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion)-related physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties have been assessed and support our in vitro findings. This work demonstrates the powerful antioxidant potency of cubeba pepper and paves the way for the discovery and development of antioxidant agent with high potency.">

This study evaluates the susceptibility of &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; strains to selected natural products (NPs) and frontline antibiotics. Two &lt;i&gt;C. jejuni&lt;/i&gt; strains (ATCC&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; 33560&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; and MT947450) and two &lt;i&gt;C. coli&lt;/i&gt; strains (ATCC&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; 33559&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; and MT947451) were used. The antimicrobial potential of the NPs, including plant extracts, essential oils, and pure phytochemicals, was evaluated by broth microdilution. The growth was measured by spectrophotometry and iodonitrotetrazolium chloride. Antibiotic resistance genes (&lt;i&gt;tet&lt;/i&gt;(O) and &lt;i&gt;gyr&lt;/i&gt;A) were characterized at the molecular level. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) ranged from 25 to 1600 µg/mL. Cinnamon oil, (E)-Cinnamaldehyde, clove oil, eugenol, and baicalein had the lowest MIC and MBC values (25-100 µg/mL). MT947450 and MT947451 were sensitive to erythromycin and gentamicin but resistant to quinolones and tetracycline. Mutations in &lt;i&gt;gyr&lt;/i&gt;A and &lt;i&gt;tet&lt;/i&gt;(O) genes from resistant strains were confirmed by sequencing. The findings show that NPs are effective against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; strains. The resistance to antibiotics was confirmed at phenotypic and genotypic levels. This merits further studies to decipher the action mechanisms and synergistic activities of NPs.">

The characteristic of the subspecies was undertaken in terms of selected morphological parameters and the quality of the raw material. The herb of both subspecies was evaluated on the content and composition of essential oil by hydrodistillation followed by GC-MS and GC-FID (gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry and flame ionization detector), the total content of phenolic acids (according to PP 6th ed.) and the content of rosmarinic acid (by HPLC). The sensory evaluation (QDA) was performed, as well. Greek oregano was distinguished by visibly higher number of glandular trichomes on the leaves (up to 4.85 per 1 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) followed by higher content of essential oil in the herb (up to 3.36 g × 100 g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW) in comparison to common oregano. Based on the essential oil composition, Greek oregano was classified as mixed carvacrol/γ-terpinene chemotype, while common oregano as mixed sabinyl/cymyl type rich in sesquiterpenes. Greek oregano was also characterized by higher total content of phenolic acids (up to 6.16 g × 100 g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW) and rosmarinic acid (up to 6787.2 mg × 100 g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW) than common oregano. Essential oil content reached the maximum at the beginning of blooming (common oregano) and at the full blooming stage (Greek oregano). In turn, the amount of phenolic acids followed by rosmarinic acid was the highest at the beginning of seed-setting stage, in the case of both subspecies. The differences between subspecies concerning chemical composition (especially essential oil) were reflected in the sensory attributes, where both odor and taste notes were found at higher level for Greek oregano. Results of our work indicate that Greek oregano is well adapted to grow in the temperate zone conditions. Such adaptation was reflected mainly in the satisfied yield and maintaining characters typical for the Mediterranean plant, e.g., a high essential oil content followed by high carvacrol share, traits the most important from practice viewpoint.">

The plant Curcuma wenyujin, which is grown primarily in Wenzhou, China, is considered the best source of Rhizoma Curcumae. In this study, we sought to ascertain differences in transcript profiles of C. wenyujin grown in traditional (Wenzhou) and recently established (Haikou) production areas based on Illumina and RNA (RNA-seq) sequencing. We also examined differences in the main components of the volatile oil terpene; curcumin, polysaccharide, and starch constituents and related genes in the corresponding pathways, in C. wenyujin cultivated in the two production areas. We accordingly found that the essential oil (2.05%), curcumin (1.46%), and polysaccharide (8.90%) content in Wenzhou rhizomes was higher than that in the rhizomes of plants from Haikou (1.60%, 0.91%, and 6.15%, respectively). In contrast, the starch content of Wenzhou rhizomes (17.0%) was lower than that of Haikou rhizomes (23.8%). Furthermore, we detected significant differences in the oil components of Haikou and Wenzhou rhizomes, with curzerene (32.34%), curdione (21.35%), and germacrene B (9.39%) being the primary components of the essential oil derived from Wenzhou rhizomes, and curzerene (20.13%), curdione (14.73%), and cineole (9.76%) being the main constituents in Haikou rhizomes. Transcriptome and qPCR analyses revealed considerable differences in gene expression between Wenzhou and Haikou rhizomes. The expression of terpene, curcumin, and polysaccharide pathway-related genes in Wenzhou rhizomes was significantly up-regulated, whereas the expression of starch-associated genes was significantly down-regulated, compared with those in Haikou rhizomes. Difference in the content of terpene, curcumin, polysaccharides, and starch in rhizomes from the two production areas could be explained in terms of differences in expression of the related genes.">

        <span class="abst" title="Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] was domesticated from wild soybean (G. soja Sieb. and Zucc.) and has been further improved as a dual-use seed crop to provide highly valuable oil and protein for food, feed, and industrial applications. However, the underlying genetic and molecular basis remains less understood. Having combined high-confidence bi-parental linkage mapping with high-resolution association analysis based on 631 whole sequenced genomes, we mapped major soybean protein and oil QTLs on chromosome15 to a sugar transporter gene (GmSWEET39). A two-nucleotide CC deletion truncating C-terminus of GmSWEET39 was strongly associated with high seed oil and low seed protein, suggesting its pleiotropic effect on protein and oil content. GmSWEET39 was predominantly expressed in parenchyma and integument of the seed coat, and likely regulates oil and protein accumulation by affecting sugar delivery from maternal seed coat to the filial embryo. We demonstrated that GmSWEET39 has a dual function for both oil and protein improvement and undergoes two different paths of artificial selection. A CC deletion (CC-) haplotype H1 has been intensively selected during domestication and extensively used in soybean improvement worldwide. H1 is fixed in North American soybean cultivars. The protein-favored (CC+) haplotype H3 still undergoes ongoing selection, reflecting its sustainable role for soybean protein improvement. The comprehensive knowledge on the molecular basis underlying the major QTL and GmSWEET39 haplotypes associated with soybean improvement would be valuable to design new strategies for soybean seed quality improvement using molecular breeding and biotechnological approaches.">

Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS), high-performance liquid chromatography, and headspace procedures are commonly used to detect and profile their chemical compositions EOs in ginger. The ginger EOs are composed of monoterpenes (transcaryophyllene, camphene, geranial, eucalyptol, and neral) and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-zingiberene, ar-curcumene, &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-bisabolene, and &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-sesquiphellandrene). GC-MS analysis of the EOs revealed many compounds but few compounds were revealed using the headspace approach. The EOs have a wide range of activities against many phytopathogens. EOs mode of action affects both the pathogen cell's external envelope and internal structures. The problems associated with solubility and stability of EOs had prompted the use nanotechnology such as nanoemulsions. The use of nanoemulsion to increase efficiency and supply of EOs to control plant diseases control was discussed in this present paper. The findings of this review paper may accelerate the effective use of ginger EOs in controlling tropical plant diseases.">

The results showed that the major chemical composition constituents of the investigated essential oil are γ-terpinene + α-terpinolene and carvacrol + p-cymene and the thermal behavior is dependent on the content. This composition drastically changes through the heating of the samples and causes significant changes in thermal behavior. The present study demonstrated that the concentration of carvacrol in S. hortensis essential oil is increasing after heating treatment, and the sample heated at 190 ºC for 2.5 h contained more than 91% carvacrol.

The chemical composition of the roots and green parts of the plant is quite well known. There is the lowest amount of data on the cypsela (fruit) of this plant. In this study, the microscopic structures and the chemical composition of the cypsela were investigated. Preliminary cytochemical studies of the structure of the &lt;i&gt;Carlina acaulis&lt;/i&gt; L. cypsela showed the presence of substantial amounts of protein and lipophilic substances. The chemical composition of the cypsela was investigated using spectrophotometry, gas chromatography with mass spectrometry, and high-performance liquid chromatography with spectrophotometric and fluorescence detection. The cypsela has been shown to be a rich source of macro- and microelements, vegetable oil (25%), α-tocopherol (approx. 2 g/kg of oil), protein (approx. 36% seed weight), and chlorogenic acids (approx. 22 g/kg seed weight). It also contains a complex set of volatile compounds. The &lt;i&gt;C. acaulis&lt;/i&gt; cypsela is, therefore, a valuable source of nutrients and bioactive substances.">

        <span class="abst" title="One of the most important challenges in the food industry is to provide healthy and safe food. Therefore, it is not possible to achieve this without different processes and the use of various additives. In order to improve safety and extend the shelf life of food products, various synthetic preservatives have been widely utilized by the food industry to prevent growth of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms. On the other hand, consumers' preference to consume food products with natural additives induced food industries to use natural-based preservatives in their production. It has been observed that herbal extracts and their essential oils could be potentially considered as a replacement for chemical antimicrobials. Antimicrobial properties of plant essential oils are derived from some main bioactive components such as phenolic acids, terpenes, aldehydes, and flavonoids that are present in essential oils. Various mechanisms such as changing the fatty acid profile and structure of cell membranes and increasing the cell permeability as well as affecting membrane proteins and inhibition of functional properties of the cell wall are effective in antimicrobial activity of essential oils. Therefore, our objective is to revise the effect of various essential oils and their bioactive components against &lt;i&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; in meat and poultry products.">

The essential oil was released from the plant matrix and isolated by hydrodistillation. The yields obtained were 4.8 ± 0.2% and 11.3 ± 0.2% for fresh and dried fruits, respectively, one of the highest yields on record to date. Twenty-five chemical compounds were identified by GC/MS and GC/FID techniques. The principal constituent was α-phellandrene, with 50.32 ± 3.32%. The antimicrobial activity of the oil was assayed against five Gram negative bacteria, two Gram positive bacteria and two fungi. The essential oil exerted a moderate activity against &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;. The repellent activity of the oil was assayed against mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae); the samples with 3%, 2% and 1% essential oil were class 4, and the sample with 0.5% showed to be class 3.

Volatile compounds produced by glandular trichomes (composed of one stalk cell and two elliptically formed head cells according to scanning electron microscope investigation) were isolated from the plants collected in two locations. Additionally, as a part of specialized metabolites, total polyphenols, total tannins, total flavonoids and total phenolic acids were determined spectrophotometrically. In the lipophilic volatile fractions-essential oils, the most abundant compounds identified were hexahydrofarnesyl acetone, caryophyllene oxide and hexadecanoic acid. In total, the class of oxygenated sesquiterpenes and the group of fatty aldehydes, acids and alcoholic compounds dominated in the essential oils. In the hydrophilic volatile fractions-hydrosols, the most abundant compounds identified were &lt;i&gt;trans-p-&lt;/i&gt;mentha-1(7),8-dien-2-ol, &lt;i&gt;allo&lt;/i&gt;-aromadendrene and &lt;i&gt;(E)-&lt;/i&gt;caryophyllene. A group of oxygenated monoterpenes and the sesquiterpene hydrocarbons dominated in the hydrosols. Antioxidant activity of essential oils and hydrosols was tested with two methods: 2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC). Essential oils showed higher antioxidant activity than hydrosols and showed similar antioxidant activity to &lt;i&gt;Rosmarinus officinalis&lt;/i&gt; essential oil. Obtained results demonstrate that this genus is a potential source of volatiles with antioxidant activity.">

Phytosterols, squalene, tocopherols, tocotrienols, and carotenoids were quantified by High Performance Liquid Chromatography with Diode-Array Detector (HPLC-DAD) and Liquid Chromatography-tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in different lots of post-fermentation corn oil and thin stillage collected from a bioethanol plant over a time-span of one year. Fat-soluble bioactives were present at high levels in corn oil, with a prevalence of plant sterols over tocols and squalene. Beta-sitosterol and sitostanol accounted altogether for more than 60% of total sterols. The carotenoid profile was that typical of corn, with lutein and zeaxanthin as the prevalent molecules. The unsaponifiable lipid fraction profile of thin stillage was qualitatively similar to that of post-fermentation corn oil but, in quantitative terms, the amounts of valuable biomolecules were much lower because of the very high dilution of this side stream. Results indicate that post-fermentation corn oil is a promising and sustainable source of health-promoting bioactive molecules. The concomitant presence of a variegate complex of bioactive molecules with high antioxidant potentialities and their potential multifaceted market applications as functional ingredients for food, nutraceutical, and cosmeceutical formulations, make the perspective of their recovery a promising strategy to create new bio-based value chains and maximize the sustainability of corn dry-grind bioethanol biorefineries.">

Its main chemical constituents are flavonoids (mainly derived from quercetin and kaempferol), C6-C1 and C6-C3 compounds, terpenes (mostly from the essential oil), and a large number of saponin molecules (mainly virgaureasaponins and solidagosaponins). Published research on its potential activities is critically reviewed here: antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, spasmolitic, antihypertensive, diuretic, antibacterial, antifungal, antiparasite, cytotoxic and antitumor, antimutagenic, antiadipogenic, antidiabetic, cardioprotective, and antisenescence. The evidence concerning its potential benefits is mainly derived from non-clinical studies, some effects are rather modest, whereas others are more promising, but need more confirmation in both non-clinical models and clinical trials.">

The objective of our research was a comparative study, in the Mediterranean context, of chemical composition, anticholinesterases, and antioxidant properties of essential oils (EOs) from sage collected in three areas (S1-S3) of Southern Italy. EOs were extracted by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitory properties were investigated by employing Ellman's method. Four in vitro assays, namely, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), ferric-reducing ability power (FRAP), and β-carotene bleaching tests, were used to study the antioxidant effects. Camphor (16.16-18.92%), 1,8-cineole (8.80-9.86%), β-pinene (3.08-9.14%), camphene (6.27-8.08%), and α-thujone (1.17-9.26%) are identified as the most abundant constituents. However, the content of these constituents varied depending on environmental factors and pedoclimatic conditions. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed. Based on Relative Antioxidant Capacity Index (RACI), S2 essential oil exhibited the highest radical potential with an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 20.64 μg/mL in ABTS test and presented the highest protection of lipid peroxidation with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 38.06 and 46.32 μg/mL after 30 and 60 min of incubation, respectively. The most promising inhibitory activity against BChE was found for S3 sample (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 33.13 μg/mL).">

Together with the cannabinoids, terpenes illustrate synergic and/or entourage effect and their interactions have only been speculated in for the last few decades. Hundreds of terpenes are identified that allude to cannabis sensory attributes, contributing largely to the consumer's experiences and market price. They also enhance many therapeutic benefits, especially as aromatherapy. To shed light on the importance of terpenes in the cannabis industry, the purpose of this review is to morphologically describe sources of cannabis terpenes and to explain the biosynthesis and diversity of terpene profiles in different cannabis chemovars.">

A critical feature of dietary fatty acids is that they incorporate into the plasma membrane, modifying fluidity and key physiological functions. Importantly, they can reshape the bioavailability of eicosanoids and other lipid mediators, which direct cellular responses to external stimuli, such as inflammation and chronic stress conditions. This paper provides an overview of the most recent evidence, as well as historical controversies, linking fat consumption with human health and disease. We underscore current pitfalls in the area of fatty acid research and critically frame fatty acid intake in the larger context of diet and behavior. We conclude that fundamental research on fatty acids and lipids is appropriate in certain areas, but the rigor and reproducibility are lacking in others. The pros and cons are highlighted throughout the review, seeking to guide future research on the important area of nutrition, fat intake, and cardiovascular disease risk.">

        <span class="abst" title="Recently, increasing public concern about hygiene has been driving many studies to investigate antimicrobial and antiviral agents. However, the use of any antimicrobial agents must be limited due to their possible toxic or harmful effects. In recent years, due to previous antibiotics' lesser side effects, the use of herbal materials instead of synthetic or chemical drugs is increasing. Herbal materials are found in medicines. Herbs can be used in the form of plant extracts or as their active components. Furthermore, most of the world's populations used herbal materials due to their strong antimicrobial properties and primary healthcare benefits. For example, herbs are an excellent material to replace nanosilver as an antibiotic and antiviral agent. The use of nanosilver involves an ROS-mediated mechanism that might lead to oxidative stress-related cancer, cytotoxicity, and heart diseases. Oxidative stress further leads to increased ROS production and also delays the cellular processes involved in wound healing. Therefore, existing antibiotic drugs can be replaced with biomaterials such as herbal medicine with high antimicrobial, antiviral, and antioxidant activity. This review paper highlights the antibacterial, antiviral, and radical scavenger (antioxidant) properties of herbal materials. Antimicrobial activity, radical scavenger ability, the potential for antimicrobial, antiviral, and anticancer agents, and efficacy in eliminating bacteria and viruses and scavenging free radicals in herbal materials are discussed in this review. The presented herbal antimicrobial agents in this review include clove, portulaca, tribulus, eryngium, cinnamon, turmeric, ginger, thyme, pennyroyal, mint, fennel, chamomile, burdock, eucalyptus, primrose, lemon balm, mallow, and garlic, which are all summarized.">

This property has been known for centuries to the people of tropical Western and Central Africa who also employ different parts of the plant in the management of various ailments. Scientific investigations have unravelled several pharmacological properties of the plant which include antidiabetic, blood cholesterol-lowering, anti-hyperuricaemia, antioxidant, anticonvulsant and anticancer properties. Also, subacute administration of the plant extract up to 200 mg/kg was not found to be toxic in rats. Apart from miraculin, other pharmacologically active compounds have been identified in the plant including alkaloids (dihydro-feruloyl-5-methoxytyramine, N-cis-caffeoyltyramine, N-cis-feruloyl-tyramine), lignins (+-syringaresinol, +-epi-syringaresinol), phytosterols, triterpenoids, phenolic acids, flavonoids, and amino acids. The plant has also been credited with notable nutritional benefits. Proper documentation of available information on folkloric use, biological activity, constituent phytocompounds, and nutritional benefits of ethnobotanicals will go a long way in affording optimal benefits from their therapeutic potentials. This can also aid in the conservation of species at risk of extinction.

The flora is determined by complex historical and environmental factors occurring since the Tertiary period. The originality of this sector is due to the presence of the argan tree (Argania spinosa (L.) Skeels), Moroccan gum (Acacia gummifera Willd), olive trees (Olea europaea L. subsp. maroccana (Greuter &amp; Burdet) P. Vargas &amp; al.), a thermophilic flora adapted to an arid climate with several endemic species. This flora constitutes the final barrier against the desert and is of environmental and socioeconomical interest. Leaves and fruits provide forage material, while wood is used for fuel. Argan fruits are collected for their oily constitutes and for nutritional, cosmetic, and medicinal properties. Additionally, many species of Argan ecosystems are used in medicine and cosmetics. Recognizing its ecological value and local economic importance, the Argan region was declared a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1998. Despite their biogeographical, historical, and socioeconomic value, vegetation structures in west-central Morocco are vulnerable and threatened by human activities.

Kitag. is an important medicinal and industrial plant, which is used in the treatment of various diseases. The main bioactive ingredient is the volatile oil having more than 82 identified components of which methyleugenol, safrole, myristicin, and toluene account for about 70% of the total volume. As a sciophyte plant, the amount of light it absorbs through leaves is an important factor for growth and metabolism.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;We grew Asarum plants under full, 50, 28, and 12% sunlight conditions to investigate the effect of different light irradiances on the four major volatile oil components. We employed de novo transcriptome sequencing to understand the transcriptional behavior of Asarum leaves regarding the biosynthetic pathways of the four volatile oil components, photosynthesis and biomass accumulation, and hormone signaling. Our results demonstrated that the increasing light conditions promoted higher percent of the four components. Under full sunlight conditions, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase and cytochrome p450719As were upregulated and led the increased methyleugenol, safrole, and myristicin. The transcriptomic data also showed that Asarum leaves, under full sunlight conditions, adjust their photosynthesis-antenna proteins as a photoprotective response with the help of carotenoids. Plant hormone-signaling related genes were also differentially expressed between full sunlight and low light conditions.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;High light induces accumulation of major bioactive ingredients A. heterotropides volatile oil and this is ascribed to upregulation of key genes such as cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase and cytochrome p450719As. The transcriptome data presented here lays the foundation of further understanding of light responses in sciophytes and provides guidance for increasing bioactive molecules in Asarum.">

Antibacterial activity was evaluated using the agar wells technique and vapour phase test. Analysis of the oils by GC/MS identified thirty-five components representing 67.5 to 100% of the total oils. Monoterpene hydrocarbons were the most prevalent compounds, followed by oxygenated monoterpenes. The content of the compounds varied according to the samples. The main components were Limonene, Piperitenone, Neral, Citral, Elemol, p-cymene, Transtagetone, and Artemisia ketone. Only one of the eleven samples contained Verbenone as the majority compound. In the vapour phase test, a single oil was the most effective against all the pathogens studied. The principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) of components of the selected EOs and inhibition zone diameter values of agar wells technique allowed us to identify a variability between the plants from the two provinces, but also intraspecific variability between sub-groups within a population. Each group of essential oils constituted a chemotype responsible for their bacterial inhibition capacity. The results presented here suggest that Angolan &lt;i&gt;Lippia multiflora&lt;/i&gt; Moldenke has antibacterial properties and could be a potential source of antimicrobial agents for the pharmaceutical and food industry.">

The fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) composition was analyzed using GC-MS and GC-FID. The anticancer activity associated with the oil was assessed against colon cancer cell lines (Caco-2 and HCT-116) and compared to its cytotoxicity on the human skin fibroblast. Multivariate analysis was used to determine relationship of the fatty acid composition with that of the anticancer activity.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The results demonstrated that fatty acid composition of &lt;i&gt;Citrullus colocynthis&lt;/i&gt; seed oil chiefly contains Linoleic acid, denoted as C18:2n6 (75%), followed by Palmitic acid C16:0 (8%), Stearic acid C18:0 (5%), and Oleic acid C18:1n9 (9%). It is demonstrated as an excellent source of essential fatty acids omega-6 (e.g., Linoleic acid), whereas omega-3 (e.g., α-Linolenic acid) and hydroxy polyunsaturated fatty acids are found at small level. Interestingly, the oil exhibited reasonable anticancer effects against colorectal cancer cell lines with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values varying between 4 and 7 mg/ml. The correlation test revealed a relationship between the fatty acid composition and the effectiveness on treatments.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Handal plant from Jordan appears to have very high level of Linoleic acid compared to other oils measured in different geographic locations and that there appears to be some anticancer activities associated with the fatty acid content of Handal seed oil.">

        <span class="abst" title="Essential oils are secondary metabolites that plants produce for protection from pests and predators, attraction of pollinators, and seed dispersal. The oils are made up of a mixture of compounds that give a characteristic flavour and odour. Currently, essential oils are receiving great attention in research for their phytochemical and antimicrobial activities. However, there is scanty information on the chemical composition of many plants. This study provides a detailed analysis of the chemical composition of essential oils of ginger, garlic, tick berry, and Mexican marigold in Kenya. The essential oils were extracted by steam distillation and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The study identified a total of 52 different chemical classes from the essential oils of the four different plants that were analysed. Their percentage composition was also found to vary between the test plants. The essential oils of Mexican marigold constituted the highest composition of the identified chemical classes at 71.2%, followed by ginger at 55.8%, while both tick berry and garlic oils constituted 53.8% of the total classes identified. Terpenes constituted the highest composition in the essential oils of all the four test plants. Other major chemical classes included esters, ketones, organosulfurs, alkanes, cycloalkanes, steroids, aromatic hydrocarbons, and alkanols. Some of these chemical compounds have been shown to have a huge utility potential in biopesticides, pharmaceutical, and food industries, and hence, their industrial extraction and purification from the essential oils of these plants are recommended.">

        <span class="abst" title="The floral fragrance of plants is an important indicator in their evaluation. The aroma of sweet cherry flowers is mainly derived from their essential oil. In this study, based on the results of a single-factor experiment, a Box-Behnken design was adopted for ultrasound- and microwave-assisted extraction of essential oil from sweet cherry flowers of the Brooks cultivar. With the objective of extracting the maximum essential oil yield (w/w), the optimal extraction process conditions were a liquid-solid ratio of 52 mL g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, an extraction time of 27 min, and a microwave power of 435 W. The essential oil yield was 1.23%, which was close to the theoretical prediction. The volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of the sweet cherry flowers of four cultivars (Brooks, Black Pearl, Tieton and Summit) were identified via headspace solid phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results showed that a total of 155 VOCs were identified and classified in the essential oil from sweet cherry flowers of four cultivars, 65 of which were shared among the cultivars. The highest contents of VOCs were aldehydes, alcohols, ketones and esters. Ethanol, linalool, lilac alcohol, acetaldehyde, (E)-2-hexenal, benzaldehyde and dimethyl sulfide were the major volatiles, which were mainly responsible for the characteristic aroma of sweet cherry flowers. It was concluded that the VOCs of sweet cherry flowers were qualitatively similar; however, relative content differences were observed in the four cultivars. This study provides a theoretical basis for the metabolism and regulation of the VOCs of sweet cherry flowers.">

Novel applications in the agri-food industry where more sustainable extraction processes are required currently and safer substances are claimed for the consumer are being investigated. This review provides information regarding the conventional and recent extraction methods of &lt;i&gt;C. longa&lt;/i&gt; rhizome oil, their characteristics and suitability to be applied at the industrial scale. In addition, variations in the chemical composition of &lt;i&gt;C. longa&lt;/i&gt; rhizome and leaf essential oils regarding intrinsic and extrinsic factors and extraction methods are also analysed in order to select the most proper to obtain the most efficient activity. Finally, the potential applications of &lt;i&gt;C. longa&lt;/i&gt; rhizome oil in the agri-food industry, such as antimicrobial, weedicide and a food preservative agent, are included. Regarding the data, &lt;i&gt;C. longa&lt;/i&gt; rhizome essential oil may play a special role in the agri-food industry; however, further research to determine the application threshold so as not to damage crops or affect the organoleptic properties of food products, as well as efficient encapsulation techniques, are necessary for its implementation in global agriculture.">

        <span class="abst" title="The plant kingdom is a rich source of health-promoting compounds and has always played a fundamental role in the isolation, identification, and modification of compounds able to perform several properties on live organisms. Among them, the so-called &quot;antioxidants&quot; have a major potentiality to increase human wellness. Antioxidants are important components in the signaling and defense mechanisms in some plants, where they are precursors of compounds of greater complexity, the modulator of plant growth, and the defensive system against pathogenic organisms and predators. The extraordinary variety of chemical structure and substitution present in the different plant antioxidants make them an inestimable source of interesting compounds, with the ability to counter reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) and to stimulate the activation of signal cascade inside the cells. The mechanisms by which antioxidants detoxify these dangerous compounds are complex and involve either direct or indirect interaction with radicals. Antioxidants inhibit or quench free radical reactions mainly based on their reducing capacity or hydrogen atom-donating capacity, their solubility, and chelating properties. Moreover, their ability to modulate key metabolic enzymes and activate/block gene transcription also has remarkable importance.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Curcuma amada&lt;/i&gt; Roxb. (Zingiberaceae), commonly known as mango ginger because its rhizome and foliar parts have a similar aroma to mango. The rhizome has been widely used in food industries and alternative medicines to treat a variety of internal diseases such as cough, bronchitis, indigestion, colic, loss of appetite, hiccups, and constipation. The composition of the volatile constituents in a fresh rhizome of &lt;i&gt;C. amada&lt;/i&gt; is not reported in detail. The present study aimed to screen and characterize the composition of volatile organic compound (VOC) in a fresh rhizome of three &lt;i&gt;C. amada&lt;/i&gt; (ZO45, ZO89, and ZO114) and one &lt;i&gt;C. longa&lt;/i&gt; (ZO138) accessions originated from Myanmar. The analysis was carried out by means of headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled with gas chromatography-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS). As a result, 122 VOCs were tentatively identified from the extracted 373 mass spectra. The following compounds were the ten most highly abundant and broadly present ones: &lt;i&gt;ar&lt;/i&gt;-turmerone, α-zingiberene, α-santalene, (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-γ-atlantone, cuparene, β-bisabolene, teresantalol, β-sesquiphellandrene, &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-α-bergamotene, γ-curcumene. The intensity of &lt;i&gt;ar-&lt;/i&gt;turmerone, the sesquiterpene which is mainly characterized in &lt;i&gt;C. longa&lt;/i&gt; essential oil (up to 15.5-27.5%), was significantly higher in &lt;i&gt;C. amada&lt;/i&gt; accession ZO89 (15.707 ± 5.78&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;) compared to &lt;i&gt;C. longa&lt;/i&gt; accession ZO138 (0.300 ± 0.08&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;). &lt;i&gt;Cis&lt;/i&gt;-α-bergamotene was not detected in two &lt;i&gt;C. amada&lt;/i&gt; accessions ZO45 and ZO89.

        <span class="abst" title="Wild food plants (WFP) have always been present in our kitchen, although they have not always been given the same importance as crops. In the Catalan linguistic area (CLA), covered in this paper, WFP were of great importance as a subsistence food not only during the years of the Spanish civil war (1936-1939) and World War II (1939-1945), but also long before these periods and in the years thereafter. The CLA has been well studied at the level of traditional knowledge on plant biodiversity, and much of this information is collected in a database by the EtnoBioFiC research group. The aim of this work is to carry out a meta-analysis of the WFP dataset of he CLA (only regarding edible uses, drinks excluded) and to identify the most quoted plants, and the information associated with them. With data from 1659 informants, we recorded 10,078 use reports of 291 taxa (278 of which at specific or subspecific levels and 13 only determined at generic level) belonging to 67 families. The most reported taxa, also with highest cultural importance indexes, are &lt;i&gt;Thymus vulgaris&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Foeniculum vulgare&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;piperitum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Laurus nobilis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Rubus ulmifolius&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mentha spicata&lt;/i&gt;. The ethnobotanicity index for food plants is 6.62% and the informant consensus factor, also for food uses, is a very high 0.97, supporting the robustness of the information. The results provided and discussed in this work concern a significant part of the edible resources in the territory considered, which is, often and mainly, underestimated and underutilised. Its consideration could be an opportunity to promote closer and more sustainable agriculture. From the state-of-the-art of this question, it is possible to propose old, in some cases forgotten foods that could be newly introduced onto the market, first, but not only, at a local level, which could be interesting for new crop development in the frame of a valorisation of territorial identity.">

        <span class="abst" title="Plants and their constituents have been used to treat diverse ailments since time immemorial. Many plants are used in diverse external and internal formulations (infusions, alcoholic extracts, essential oils (EOs), etc.) in the treatment of inflammation-associated diseases, such as those affecting the respiratory tract or causing gastrointestinal or joint problems, among others. To support the traditional uses of plant extracts, EOs have been assessed for their alleged anti-inflammatory properties. However, the effect of EOs on the release of cytokines and chemokines has been much less reported. Considering their traditional use and commercial relevance in Portugal and Angola, this study evaluated the effect of EOs on the in vitro inhibition of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human acute monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1 cells). Twenty EOs extracted from eighteen species from seven families, namely from Amaranthaceae (&lt;i&gt;Dysphania ambrosioides&lt;/i&gt;), Apiaceae (&lt;i&gt;Foeniculum vulgare&lt;/i&gt;), Asteraceae (&lt;i&gt;Brachylaena huillensis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Solidago virgaurea&lt;/i&gt;), Euphorbiaceae (&lt;i&gt;Spirostachys africana&lt;/i&gt;), Lamiaceae (&lt;i&gt;Lavandula luisieri&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Mentha cervina&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Origanum majorana&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Satureja montana&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Thymbra capitata&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Thymus mastichina&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Thymus vulgaris&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Thymus zygis&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;zygis&lt;/i&gt;), Myrtaceae (&lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus globulus&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;maidenii&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus radiata&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus viminalis&lt;/i&gt;) and Pinaceae (&lt;i&gt;Pinus pinaster&lt;/i&gt;) were assayed for the release of CCL2 and TNF-α by LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells. &lt;i&gt;B. huillensis, S. africana, S. montana, Th. mastichina&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Th. vulgaris&lt;/i&gt; EOs showed toxicity to THP-1 cells, at the lowest concentration tested (10 μg/mL), using the tetrazolium dye assay. The most active EOs in reducing TNF-α release by LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells were those of &lt;i&gt;T. capitata&lt;/i&gt; (51% inhibition at 20 μg/mL) and &lt;i&gt;L. luisieri&lt;/i&gt; (15-23% inhibition at 30 μg/mL and 78-83% inhibition at 90 μg/mL). &lt;i&gt;L. luisieri&lt;/i&gt; EO induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of CCL2 release by LPS‑stimulated THP-1 cells (23%, 54% and 82% inhibition at 10, 30 and 90 μg/mL, respectively). These EOs are potentially useful in the management of inflammatory diseases mediated by CCL2 and TNF‑α, such as atherosclerosis and arthritis.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Rhus coriaria&lt;/i&gt; L. (Anacardiaceae), commonly known as sumac, is a commonly used spice, condiment, and flavoring agent, especially in the Mediterranean region. Owing to its bountiful beneficial values, sumac has been used in traditional medicine for the management and treatment of many ailments including hemorrhoids, wound healing, diarrhea, ulcer, and eye inflammation. This plant is rich in various classes of phytochemicals including flavonoids, tannins, polyphenolic compounds, organic acids, and many others. By virtue of its bioactive, &lt;i&gt;Rhus coriaria&lt;/i&gt; possesses powerful antioxidant capacities that have ameliorative and therapeutic benefits for many common diseases including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. This review describes the phytochemical properties of &lt;i&gt;R. coriaria&lt;/i&gt; and then focuses on the potent antioxidant capacities of sumac. We then dissect the cellular and molecular mechanisms of sumac's action in modulating many pathophysiological instigators. We show how accumulating evidence supports the antibacterial, antinociceptive, antidiabetic, cardioprotective, neuroprotective, and anticancer effects of this plant, especially that toxicity studies show that sumac is very safe to consume by humans and has little toxicity. Taken together, the findings we summarize here support the utilization of this plant as an attractive target for drug discovery.">

Medicinal plants and their bioactive molecules are potential candidates for improving human health. In this work, we studied the effect of &lt;i&gt;Ptychotis verticillata&lt;/i&gt; (PV) essential oil and its derivatives, carvacrol and thymol, in AML cell lines. We demonstrated that a combination of carvacrol and thymol induced tumor cell death with low toxicity on normal cells. Mechanistically, we highlighted that different molecular pathways, including apoptosis, oxidative, reticular stress, autophagy, and necrosis, are implicated in this potential synergistic effect. Using quantitative RT-PCR, Western blotting, and apoptosis inhibitors, we showed that cell death induced by the carvacrol and thymol combination is caspase-dependent in the HL60 cell line and caspase-independent in the other cell lines tested. Further investigations should focus on improving the manufacturing of these compounds and understanding their anti-tumoral mechanisms of action. These efforts will lead to an increase in the efficiency of the oncotherapy strategy regarding AML.">

However, their roles in regulating plant height remain unreported. Here, we report that Arabidopsis GPAT1 is involved in the regulation of plant height. GUS assay and qRT-PCR analysis in Arabidopsis showed that &lt;i&gt;GPAT1&lt;/i&gt; is highly expressed in flowers, siliques, and seeds. A loss of function mutation in &lt;i&gt;GPAT1&lt;/i&gt; was shown to decrease seed yield but increase plant height through enhanced cell length. Transcriptomic and qRT-PCR data revealed that the expression levels of genes related to gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis and signaling, as well as those of cell wall organization and biogenesis, were significantly upregulated. These led to cell length elongation, and thus, an increase in plant height. Together, our data suggest that knockout of &lt;i&gt;GPAT1&lt;/i&gt; impairs glycerolipid metabolism in Arabidopsis, leading to reduced seed yield, but promotes the biosynthesis of GA, which ultimately enhances plant height. This study provides new evidence on the interplay between lipid and hormone metabolism in the regulation of plant height.">

        <span class="abst" title="Rye (&lt;i&gt;Secale cereale&lt;/i&gt; L.) is one of the most important cereal crops in Eastern and Northern Europe, showing better tolerance to environmental stress factors compared to wheat and triticale. Plant response to the crude oil-polluted soil depends on plant species, oil concentration, time of exposure, etc. The current study is aimed at investigating the growth, oxidative stress and the response of antioxidative system of two rye varieties (Krona and Valdai) cultivated on crude oil-contaminated soils at different concentrations (1.5, 3.0, 6.0, and 12.0%). Inhibition of rye growth was observed at crude oil concentrations of above 3% for above-ground plant parts and of above 1.5% for roots. A decrease in content of chlorophyll &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; and total chlorophylls in Krona variety was detected at 1.5% oil concentration in soil and in Valdai variety at 3% oil concentration. Compared with the control, the content of malondialdehyde was significantly increased in the Krona variety at 3% oil concentration and in Valdai variety at 6% oil concentration. The crude oil-induced oxidative stress was minimized in rye plants by the enhanced contents of low-molecular antioxidants (proline, non-protein thiols, ascorbic acid, phenolic compounds) and activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, and glutathione peroxidase. The strongest positive correlation was detected between the content of malondialdehyde and contents of proline (r = 0.89-0.95, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≤ 0.05) and phenolic compounds (r = 0.90-0.94, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≤ 0.05) as well as superoxide dismutase activity (r = 0.81-0.90, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≤ 0.05). Based on the results of a comprehensive analysis of growth and biochemical parameters and of the cluster analysis, Valdai variety proved to be more resistant to oil pollution. Due to this, Valdai variety is considered to be a promising rye variety for cultivation on moderately oil-polluted soils in order to decontaminate them. At the same time, it is necessary to conduct further studies aimed at investigating oil transformation processes in the soil-rye system, which would make it possible to determine the efficiency of using this cereal for soil remediation.">

Antioxidant potential was monitored as: (i) direct antioxidant activity as assessed by 2,2-di-phenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), and ABTS assays; (ii) DNA damage protection activity; and (iii) cytoprotective activity as assessed via induction of transcription of genes related to the antioxidant response in human keratinocyte cells (HaCaT). The cytoprotective potential of the test substances was further evaluated against ultraviolet radiation B (UVB)- or H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced oxidative damage, whereas their regenerative capability was accessed by monitoring the wound closure rate in HaCaT. Μastic oil and major components did not show significant direct antioxidant activity, however they increased the mRNA levels of antioxidant response genes, suggesting indirect antioxidant activity. Treatment of HaCaT with the test substances before and after UVB irradiation resulted in increased cell viability in the cases of pre-treatment with mastic oil or post-treatment with myrcene. Increased cytoprotection was also observed in the case of cell treatment with mastic oil or its major components prior to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exposure. Finally, mastic oil and myrcene demonstrated a favorable dose-dependent effect for cell migration and wound closure.

The treatment for cutaneous infections caused by &lt;i&gt;Trichophyton&lt;/i&gt; spp. are imidazoles (ketoconazole (KTZ)) and triazoles (itraconazole (ITZ)). &lt;i&gt;T. rubrum&lt;/i&gt; can develop resistance to azoles after prolonged exposure to subinhibitory concentrations resulting in therapeutic failures and chronic infections. These problems have stimulated the search for therapeutic alternatives, including essential oils, and their potential use in combination with conventional antifungals. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antifungal activity of tea tree oil (TTO) (&lt;i&gt;Melaleuca alternifolia&lt;/i&gt; essential oil) and the main components against &lt;i&gt;T. rubrum&lt;/i&gt; and to assess whether TTO in association with KTZ/ITZ as reference drugs improves the antifungal activity of these drugs. We used a terpinen-4-ol chemotype (35.88%) TTO, and its antifungal properties were evaluated by minimum inhibitory and minimum fungicidal concentrations in accordance with the CLSI guidelines. The interaction between TTO and azoles was evaluated through the checkerboard and isobologram methods. The results demonstrated both the fungicide activity of TTO on &lt;i&gt;T. rubrum&lt;/i&gt; and the synergism when it was used in combination with azoles. Therefore, this mixture may reduce the minimum effective dose of azole required and minimize the side effects of the therapy.

Mango is commercially important in India, where ~55% of the global crop is produced. The fruit has three main parts: pulp, peel, and kernel. The pulp is the most-consumed part, while the peel and kernel are usually discarded. Mango pulp is a source of a variety of reducing sugars, amino acids, aromatic compounds, and functional compounds, such as pectin, vitamins, anthocyanins, and polyphenols. Mango processing generates peels and kernels as bio-wastes, though they also have nutraceutical significance. Functional compounds in the peel, including protocatechuic acids, mangiferin and β-carotene are known for their antimicrobial, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-carcinogenic properties. The mango kernel has higher antioxidant and polyphenolic contents than the pulp and peel and is used for oil extraction; it's possible usage in combination with corn and wheat flour in preparing nutraceuticals is being increasingly emphasized.

The current review provides an overview of the most common SM classes (chemical structures, classification, biological activities) present in different plant waste/by-products and their potential use in various fields. A bibliographic survey was carried out, taking into account 99 research articles (from 2006 to 2020), summarizing all the information about waste type, its plant source, industrial sector of provenience, contained SMs, reported bioactivities, and proposals for its valorization. This survey highlighted that a great deal of the current publications are focused on the exploitation of plant wastes in human healthcare and food (including cosmetic, pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and food additives). However, as summarized in this review, plant SMs also possess an enormous potential for further uses. Accordingly, an increasing number of investigations on neglected plant matrices and their use in areas such as veterinary science or agriculture are expected, considering also the need to implement &quot;greener&quot; practices in the latter sector.">

A literature search was performed to find materials describing (i) botanical characteristics; (ii) the phytochemical profile; and (iii) biological properties of the essential oil sand extracts of these so called &quot;old roses&quot; that are cultivated in Bulgaria, Turkey, India, and the Middle East. The information used is from databases PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar. Roses have beneficial healing properties due to their richness of beneficial components, the secondary metabolites as flavonoids (e.g., flavones, flavonols, anthocyanins), fragrant components (essential oils, e.g., monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes), and hydrolysable and condensed tannins. Rose essential oils and extracts with their therapeutic properties-as respiratory antiseptics, anti-inflammatories, mucolytics, expectorants, decongestants, and antioxidants-are able to act as symptomatic prophylactics and drugs, and in this way alleviate dramatic sufferings during severe diseases.">

Due to the pharmacological efficacy and the low toxicity of the essential oil of Hyptis crenata (EOHc), we decided to investigate the EOHc antiedematogenic effect in experimental models of inflammation. EOHc was administrated orally at doses of 10-300 mg/kg to male Swiss albino mice. Paw edema was induced by subcutaneous injection in the right hind paw of inflammatory stimuli (carrageenan, dextran, histamine, serotonin, and bradykinin) 60 min after administration of EOHc. EOHc significantly inhibited the induced edema. The inhibitory effect of EOHc on dextran-induced edema extended throughout the experimental time. For the 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg doses of EOHc, the inhibition was of 40.28±1.70, 51.18±2.69, and 59.24±2.13%, respectively. The EOHc inhibitory effect on carrageenan-induced edema started at 10 mg/kg at the second hour (h) and was maintained throughout the observation period. At 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg doses the inhibition started earlier, from 30 min. At the edema peak of 180 min, 56, 76, and 82% inhibition was observed for 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg doses, respectively. Additionally, the effect of EOHc on carrageenan-induced paw edema was influenced by the time of administration. The EOHc also inhibited myeloperoxidase activity. In conclusion, the EOHc showed a potent effect, both preventing and reversing the edema, consistent with its anti-inflammatory use in folk medicine.">

Here, iron nanoparticles (FeNPs) were synthesized using &lt;i&gt;Satureja hortensis&lt;/i&gt; essential oil. Then, the chemical, functional, and morphological properties of these nanoparticles were characterized by typical experiments such as Uv-Vis, FTIR, XRD, FE-SEM, PSA, zeta potential, EDX, and EDX mapping. The results indicated Fe nanoparticles' formation with a cubic morphological structure and a particle size in the range of 9.3-27 nm. The antimicrobial effects of these nanoparticles were further evaluated using disc diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), and minimum fungal concentration (MFC) against two gram-positive bacterial strains (&lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Corynebacterium glutamicum&lt;/i&gt;), two gram-negative bacterial strains (&lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;), and one fungus species &lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt;. The results showed that green-synthesized Fe nanoparticles possessed higher antimicrobial properties than Satureja hortensis essential oil against selected pathogenic microorganisms, especially Gram-negative bacteria. Finally, the anticancer effect of these Fe nanoparticles was investigated on human cancer cells, K-562, and MCF-7, by the MTT assay. The results showed the anticancer effect of these nanoparticles against selected cell lines.">

        <span class="abst" title="Akebia trifoliata subsp. australis is a well-known medicinal and potential woody oil plant in China. The limited genetic information available for A. trifoliata subsp. australis has hindered its exploitation. Here, a high-quality chromosome-level genome sequence of A. trifoliata subsp. australis is reported. The de novo genome assembly of 682.14 Mb was generated with a scaffold N50 of 43.11 Mb. The genome includes 25,598 protein-coding genes, and 71.18% (485.55 Mb) of the assembled sequences were identified as repetitive sequences. An ongoing massive burst of long terminal repeat (LTR) insertions, which occurred ~1.0 million years ago, has contributed a large proportion of LTRs in the genome of A. trifoliata subsp. australis. Phylogenetic analysis shows that A. trifoliata subsp. australis is closely related to Aquilegia coerulea and forms a clade with Papaver somniferum and Nelumbo nucifera, which supports the well-established hypothesis of a close relationship between basal eudicot species. The expansion of UDP-glucoronosyl and UDP-glucosyl transferase gene families and β-amyrin synthase-like genes and the exclusive contraction of terpene synthase gene families may be responsible for the abundant oleanane-type triterpenoids in A. trifoliata subsp. australis. Furthermore, the acyl-ACP desaturase gene family, including 12 stearoyl-acyl-carrier protein desaturase (SAD) genes, has expanded exclusively. A combined transcriptome and fatty-acid analysis of seeds at five developmental stages revealed that homologs of SADs, acyl-lipid desaturase omega fatty acid desaturases (FADs), and oleosins were highly expressed, consistent with the rapid increase in the content of fatty acids, especially unsaturated fatty acids. The genomic sequences of A. trifoliata subsp. australis will be a valuable resource for comparative genomic analyses and molecular breeding.">

Due to the abundant unsaturated fatty acids in its seed, it can also be regarded as a new oilseed plant. However, the process of the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids in it has remained unknown. Therefore, transcriptome analysis is helpful to better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Five main fatty acids were detected, including stearic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid and α-linolenic acid, and their absolute contents first increased and then decreased during seed development. A total of 150,156 unigenes were obtained by transcriptome sequencing. There were 15,005 unigenes annotated in the seven functional databases, including NR, NT, GO, KOG, KEGG, Swiss-Prot and InterPro. Based on the KEGG database, 1766 unigenes were annotated in the lipid metabolism. There were 4635, 12,304, and 18,291 DEGs in Group I (60 vs 30 DAF), Group II (90 vs 60 DAF) and Group III (90 vs 30 DAF), respectively. A total of 1480 DEGs were detected in the intersection of the three groups. In 14 KEGG pathways of lipid metabolism, 503 DEGs were found, belonging to 111 enzymes. We screened out 123 DEGs involved in fatty acid biosynthesis (39 DEGs), fatty acid elongation (33 DEGs), biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acid (24 DEGs), TAG assembly (17 DEGs) and lipid storage (10 DEGs). Furthermore, qRT-PCR was used to analyze the expression patterns of 16 genes, including BBCP, BC, MCAT, KASIII, KASII, FATA, FATB, KCR, SAD, FAD2, FAD3, FAD7, GPAT, DGAT, OLE and CLO, most of which showed the highest expression at 45 DAF, except for DGAT, OLE and CLO, which showed the highest expression at 75 DAF.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;We predicted that MCAT, KASIII, FATA, SAD, FAD2, FAD3, DGAT and OLE were the key genes in the unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and oil accumulation in herbaceous peony seed. This study provides the first comprehensive genomic resources characterizing herbaceous peony seed gene expression at the transcriptional level. These data lay the foundation for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of fatty acid biosynthesis and oil accumulation for herbaceous peony.">

This study provides the first experimental evidence for comparison of the efficacy of pyrochar (slow pyrolysis biochar), thermal desorption and their combined application for degradation of crude oil contaminated soil (0%, 10%, and 20%), and growth of lettuce under glasshouse conditions. Pyrochar was produced by pyrolysis of sawdust at 350 °C, whereas thermal desorption was done by soil pyrolysis at 500 °C. Soil incubations were done for 120 days. The results of soil analysis showed that the crude oil degradation efficiency for the combined application was highest (40%), whereas pyrochar and thermal desorption was 25% and 19.6%, respectively. The maximum degradation products of crude oil were manifested by the detection of low molecular weight hydrocarbons (ranged between 173 and 422) in the soil with combined application treatment using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Crude oil contamination significantly reduced the germination and growth of the lettuce plants. Similarly, the combined application also improved plant growth by an increase of 24% in germination percentage, 35.5% in seedling vigor index, and 27% in promptness index under 20% crude oil contamination. Remediation caused a significant increase in fresh and dry biomass (40%), leaf area (30%), total chlorophyll (21%), water potential (23.6%), osmotic potential (27%), and membrane stability index (40%). Moreover, there was an increase in the contents of proline (32%), total amino acids (29%), soluble sugars (37%), proteins (27%), and antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (19%), catalase (33%) and peroxidase (38%). This study confirmed the efficacy of pyrochar (slow pyrolysis biochar), thermal desorption, and their combined application for crude oil decontamination of soil at laboratory scale and also in improving soil usability by improved germination and growth of lettuce.">

Application of phosphate rock, a non-renewable resource has been the common practice to increase Pi accessibility and maintain crop productivity in Malaysia. However, high fixation rate of Pi in the native acidic tropical soils has led to excessive utilization of P fertilizers. This has caused serious environmental pollutions and cost increment. Even so, the Pi deficiency response mechanism in oil palm as one of the basic prerequisites for crop improvement remains largely unknown.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Using total RNA extracted from young roots as template, we performed a comparative transcriptome analysis on oil palm responding to 14d and 28d of Pi deprivation treatment and under adequate Pi supply. By using Illumina HiSeq4000 platform, RNA-Seq analysis was successfully conducted on 12 paired-end RNA-Seq libraries and generated more than 1.2 billion of clean reads in total. Transcript abundance estimated by fragments per kilobase per million fragments (FPKM) and differential expression analysis revealed 36 and 252 genes that are differentially regulated in Pi-starved roots at 14d and 28d, respectively. Genes possibly involved in regulating Pi homeostasis, nutrient uptake and transport, hormonal signaling and gene transcription were found among the differentially expressed genes.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Our results showed that the molecular response mechanism underlying Pi starvation in oil palm is complexed and involved multilevel regulation of various sensing and signaling components.

In this regard, we analysed a time series RNA-seq data set of seed tissue from both of the cultivars by mainly focusing on the monotonically expressed genes (MEGs). The consideration of the MEGs enables the capturing of multi-stage progression processes that are orchestrated by the cooperative TFs and, thus, facilitates the understanding of the molecular mechanisms determining seed oil content. Our findings show that TF families, such as NAC, MYB, DOF, GATA, and HD-ZIP are highly involved in the seed developmental process. Particularly, their preferential partner choices as well as changes in their gene expression profiles seem to be strongly associated with the differentiation of the oil content between the two cultivars. These findings are essential in enhancing our understanding of the genetic programs in both cultivars and developing novel hypotheses for further experimental studies.">

The edible packaging experimentally produced by casting from an aqueous solution were evaluated by the following analysis: UV-Vis spectrum, transparency value, transmittance, attenuated total reflectance Fourier-Transform spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and antimicrobial activity. The obtained results showed that the combination of orange essential oil with trehalose decreases the transmittance value in the UV and Vis regions (up to 0.14% ± 0.02% at 356 nm), meaning that produced films can act as a UV protector. Most produced films in the research were resistant to Gram-positive bacteria (&lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt;), though most films did not show antibacterial properties against Gram-negative bacteria and yeasts. FTIR and SEM confirmed that both the amount of carrageenan used and the combination with orange essential oil influenced the compatibility of trehalose with the film matrix. The research showed how different combinations of trehalose, orange essential oils and carrageenan can affect edible film properties. These changes represent important information for further research and the possible practical application of these edible matrices.">

        <span class="abst" title="The Sudd wetland is one of the oil-rich regions of South Sudan where environmental pollution resulting from oil extraction activities has been unprecedented. Although phytoremediation is the most feasible technique, its efficacy reduces at high TPH concentration in soil. This has made rhizoremediation the most preferred approach. Rhizoremediation involves use of a combination of phytoremediation and biostimulation. The process is catalyzed by the action of rhizobacteria. Therefore, the objective of this study is to characterize rhizobacteria communities prevalent in phytoremediation species growing in hydrocarbon-contaminated soils biostimulated with cattle manure. The treatments studied were plant species only (T1), plant species and hydrocarbons (T2), plant species and manure (T3), and plant species, manure, and hydrocarbons (T4). The rhizobacteria communities were determined using pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA. In the treatment with phytoremediation species, hydrocarbons 75 g · kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;soil, and cattle manure 5 g · kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;soil (T4), there was a significant increase (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05) in rhizobacteria abundance with the highest ASV observed in &lt;i&gt;H. rufa&lt;/i&gt; (4980) and the lowest in &lt;i&gt;S. arundinaceum&lt;/i&gt; (3955). In the same treatment, bacteria community diversity was high in &lt;i&gt;H. rufa&lt;/i&gt; (Chao1, 10310) and the least in &lt;i&gt;S. arundinaceum&lt;/i&gt; (Chao 1, 8260) with Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria as the dominant phyla. Similarly, in contaminated soil treated with cattle manure, there was a significant increase (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05) in abundance of rhizobacteria genera with &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/i&gt; dominating across phytoremediation species. &lt;i&gt;H. rufa&lt;/i&gt; was dominated by &lt;i&gt;Bacillus, Fusibacter,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Rhodococcus&lt;/i&gt;; &lt;i&gt;G. barbadense&lt;/i&gt; was mainly associated with &lt;i&gt;Luteimonas&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;T. diversifolia&lt;/i&gt; was inhabited by &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Luteimonas&lt;/i&gt;. The rhizosphere of &lt;i&gt;O. longistaminata&lt;/i&gt; was dominated by &lt;i&gt;Bacillus, Fusibacter,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Luteimonas,&lt;/i&gt; while &lt;i&gt;S. arundinaceum&lt;/i&gt; was largely inhabited by &lt;i&gt;Sphingomonas.&lt;/i&gt; These rhizobacteria genera ought to be applied in the Sudd region for bioremediation.">

        <span class="abst" title="Fragrance is an integral part of cosmetic products and is often regarded as an overriding factor in the selection of cosmetics among consumers. Fragrances also play a considerable role in masking undesirable smells arising from fatty acids, oils and surfactants that are commonly used in cosmetic formulations. Essential oils are vital assets in the cosmetic industry, as along with imparting pleasant aromas in different products, they are able to act as preservatives and active agents and, simultaneously, offer various benefits to the skin. Moreover, the stimulating demand for natural ingredients has contributed massively to a renewed interest in cosmetic and wellness industries in plant derivatives, especially essential oils. This has led popular cosmetic companies to endorse natural fragrances and opt for minimally processed natural ingredients, given the potentially adverse health risks associated with artificial fragrance chemicals, which are major elements of cosmetics. Among the high-valued essential oils used as fragrances are citrus, lavender, eucalyptus, tea tree and other floral oils, among others, while linalool, geraniol, limonene, citronellol, and citral are much-appreciated fragrance components used in different cosmetics. Thus, this review aimed to highlight the enormous versatility of essential oils as significant sources of natural fragrances in cosmetics and cosmeceuticals. Moreover, a special focus will be laid on the different aspects related to essential oils such as their sources, market demand, chemistry, fragrance classification, aroma profile, authenticity and safety.">

This study was aimed to explore the efficacy of several Egyptian plant extracts against Toxoplasma gondii infection in vitro for future development of a new, safe, and effective compound for T. gondii. Methanol extracts from Matricaria chamomilla (German chamomile), Laurus nobilis, Citrullus colocynthis, Cinnamum camphora, Boswellia scara, and Melissa officionalis plants and oil extracts (either essential or fixed oils) of some plants such as: lemon grass (Cymbopogon citratus), marjoram (Origanum majorana), watercress (Nasturtium officionale), wheat germ (Triticum aestivum), sesame (Sesamum indicum), rosemary (Salvia rosmarinus), citronella (Cymbopogon nardus), clove (Syzygum aromaticum), jojoba (Simmondsia chinesis), and basil (Ocimum basilicum) were investigated for their anti-Toxoplasma activities. The methanol extracts from C. colocynthis and L. nobilis and the oil extracts from lemon grass and marjoram were active against T. gondii with half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) of 22.86 µg/ml, 31.35 µg/ml, 4.6 µg/ml, and 26.24 µg/ml, respectively. Their selectivity index (SI) values were &lt;10. Interestingly, the methanol extract from M. chamomilla and oil from citronella had the lowest IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values for T. gondii (3.56 µg/ml and 2.54 µg/ml, respectively) and the highest SI values (130.33 and 15.02, respectively). In conclusion, methanol extract from M. chamomilla and oil from citronella might be potential sources of novel therapies for treating toxoplasmosis.">

Ecotypic oils were extracted and analyzed with the GC-MS. Their biological properties in terms of antimicrobial, antioxidant, and antigenotoxic activities were evaluated using the minimal inhibitory concentration, minimal bactericidal concentration, and DPPH, &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-carotene, and comet assays. The GC-MS results for &lt;i&gt;Thymus daenensis&lt;/i&gt; Celak oils revealed thymol (73.86%) and carvacrol (51.89%) as the most abundant components. Due to the results, reasonable bactericidal activity values range from 0.14 to 5.00 mg/ml, and fungicidal activity ranges from 0.17 to 0.58 mg/ml. The necessary oil free radical scavenging capacity (0.41-1.79 mg/ml), bleaching inhibitory activity (0.01-1.06 mg/ml), and genoprotective potential (1.04-7.78 mg/ml) indicated the dose-dependent activity. The results suggest that &lt;i&gt;Thymus daenensis&lt;/i&gt; is an important antibacterial and antifungal bioresource. Additionally, the antioxidant and radical scavenging capacity suggests this species has a role as a natural preservative in oxidative diseases and in the prevention of food spoilage.">

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of variety and type of extracts on 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) reducing capacity, antibacterial activity, and chemical composition of essential oil from turmeric varieties cultivated in Ethiopia. The results from the statistical analysis revealed that the highest total curcuminoids content (6.81% m/m), essential oil (6.37% v/m), methanol extract (13.42% v/m) were obtained from Dame variety. On the other hand, the lowest curcuminoids (5.12% m/m), methanol extract (10.58% v/m) and essential oil (3.92% v/m) contents were obtained from HT3/2002 variety. Dame variety also had the highest total polyphenol content (97.55 mg GAE/g) and radical scavenging capacity (46.58 16 μg/mL) with the lowest IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value (23.05 μg/mL). Among the tested microorganisms with turmeric extracts, growth inhibition was observed against &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt;. The results also indicated that three compounds, namely α-Turmerone (32.41 and 35.16%), ar-Turmerone (25.20 and 25.47%), and Curlone (17.98 and 18.19%) dominated 75% of the essential oil component in Dame and Bonga 51/71 varieties, respectively. In summary, the results of this study revealed that extracts from Dame variety have strong biological potential with desired antioxidant and antibacterial activities.">

In view of this objective, the present study demonstrates the efficacy of lemongrass (LG) and tea tree essential oils (TTEOs) against &lt;i&gt;M. domestica&lt;/i&gt;. The TTEO proved to be more lethal against larvae and adults of &lt;i&gt;M. domestica&lt;/i&gt; depicting an LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; at 14.88 mg/ dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; which was 17.19 mg/ dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for LGEO. In contrast, pupicidal effect of LGEO was much higher (LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, 14.49 µl/0.25L) as compared to TTEO. The LGEO drastically reduced the total body sugar, glycogen and protein contents by 3.29, 2.95 and 7.56 fold, respectively, contrasting with high influence of TTEO on lipid content of the late 3rd instar larvae. A considerable reduction in gut enzymes secretion was observed due to treatment of EOs thereby altering gut physiology of the insect. Moreover, significant inhibition of acetylcholine esterase (AchE) was also observed with LGEO at LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; concentration (5.33 mg/ml) inhibiting insect neurotransmission. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) analysis of the LGEO showed 12 major compounds dominated by Citral whereas TTEO contained only 5 major compounds. Further analysis by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) revealed distortion and shrinkage of larval bodies caused by the treatment of EOs. These overall observations brand LG and TT-EOs as potential organic-insecticides against &lt;i&gt;M. domestica&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;h4&gt;Graphic abstract&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Supplementary information&lt;/h4&gt;The online version of this article (10.1007/s40011-020-01220-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.">

        <span class="abst" title="In tropical rainforests, access to and availability of natural resources are vital for the dietary diversity and food security of forest-dwelling societies. In the Congo Basin, these are challenged by the increasing exploitation of forests for bushmeat, commercial hardwood, mining, and large-scale agriculture. In this context, a balanced approach is needed between the pressures from forest exploitation, non-timber forest product trade and the livelihood and dietary behavior of rural communities. While there is a general positive association between tree cover and dietary diversity, the complex biocultural interactions between tropical forest food resources and the communities they sustain are still understudied. This research focuses on the knowledge and use of wild food plants by the forest-dwelling Baka people in southeast Cameroon. By using two different sets of methods, namely ex-situ interviews and in-situ surveys, we collected ethnographic and ethnobotanical data in two Baka settlements and explored the diversity of wild edible plants known, the frequency of their consumption, and potential conflicts between local diet and commercial trade in forest resources. Within a single Baka population, we showed that the in-situ walk-in-the-woods method resulted in more detailed information on wild food plant knowledge and use frequency than the ex-situ methods of freelisting and dietary recalls. Our in-situ method yielded 91 wild edible species, much more than the ex-situ freelisting interviews (38 spp.) and dietary recalls (12 spp.). Our results suggest that studies that are based only on ex-situ interviews may underestimate the importance of wild food plants for local communities. We discuss the limitations and strengths of these different methods for investigating the diversity of wild food plant knowledge and uses. Our analysis shows that future studies on wild food plants would profit from a mixed approach that combines in-situ and ex-situ methods.">

No cure exists for HSV-1 or HSV-2 infections, but antiviral medications are commonly used to prevent and treat outbreaks. Resistance to antivirals has begun to emerge, placing an importance on finding new and effective therapies for prophylaxis and treatment of HSV outbreaks. Botanicals may be effective HSV therapies as the constituents they contain act through a variety of mechanisms, potentially making the development of antiviral resistance more challenging. A wide variety of plants from different regions in the world have been studied for antiviral activity against HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 and showed efficacy of varying degrees. The purpose of this review is to summarize research conducted on whole plant extracts against HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 in vitro and in vivo. The majority of the research reviewed was conducted in vitro using animal cell lines, and some studies used an animal model design. Also summarized are a limited number of human trials conducted using botanical therapies on HSV lesions.">

The antioxidant activity of TVH and OVEO was done with the use of 1,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity. The study used nine groups of rats to investigate the effect of TVH, OVEO, and a mixture of TVH and OVEO (HEM) on CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-induced toxicity. Intraperitoneal injection of CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (1 mL/100 g) was used to induce toxicity. The doses of TVH and OVEO were 1 mg/kg.b.wt, and 50 mg/kg.b.wt, respectively.

The disease appeared as a serious problem and the leading cause of death in human beings throughout the world. The main source of different phytochemicals are plants, which helps in the development of new drugs against various ailments. Islam is comprehensive religion and a complete code of life for Muslims. The teaching of Islam, according to the Holy Quran and Hadith are universal for the benefit of humanity. Islam believes that every ailment is from God and who made the disease definitely made its medication. There is a complete guideline with regard to taking measures against infectious diseases such as quarantine and seeking medicinal treatment. The research objective is to gather the knowledge of medicinal plants described in the Holy Quran or utilized by the Prophet (SAW) for the treatment of different ailments or advised to use them to boost immunity and strengthen the body. Scientists across the globe have found these plants beneficial for many diseases and have antiviral potential. In present study, the six plant species including &lt;i&gt;Olea europaea , Nigella sativa, Allium Sativum, Allium cepa, Zingiber officinale&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Cassia senna&lt;/i&gt; were selected which contain phytochemicals like Calcium Elenolate, Thymoquinone, S-Allylcysteine, Dipropyl Disulfide, Sesquiterpene, Monoterpene, Pelargonidin 3-Galactoside ion and Kaempferol. The phytochemicals monoterpene (from &lt;i&gt;Zingiber officinale&lt;/i&gt;) shows best interaction with target proteins RdRP, 3CLPro, ACE2. Calcium Elonate (from olive) bonds with 3CLPro, ACE2 and Kemoferol and Pelargomidine (from Senna Makki) bonds with RdRP, ACE2. The ligands show a unique set of intersections i.e. hydrogen bonding, and alkyl interaction. These medicinal plants can be utilized immediately for the treatment of COVID-19 as their safety is already established. This treatment can enhance recovery when combined with other treatments. Furthermore, the screening of bioactive compounds or phytochemicals found in these plants can be utilized to design new therapeutic drug to treat COVID-19 pandemic.">

        <span class="abst" title="The parasitic diseases represent the most important health risk, especially in underdeveloped countries where they have a deep impact on public health. Trichomoniasis is a prevalent non-viral sexually transmitted disease, and a significant amount of new cases are identified each year globally. Furthermore, the infection is linked with serious concerns such as pregnancy outcomes, infertility, predisposition to cervical and prostate cancer, and increased transmission and acquisition of HIV. The therapy is restricted, adverse effects are often observed, and resistance to the drugs is emerging. Based on this, a new treatment for trichomoniasis is necessary. Natural products represent a rich source of bioactive compounds, and even today, they are used in the search for new drugs. Additionally, natural products provide a wide variety of leadership structures that can be used by the pharmaceutical industry as a template in the development of new drugs that are more effective and have fewer or no undesirable side effects compared to current treatments. This review focuses on the medicinal plants that possess anti-trichomonal activity in vitro or in vivo. An electronic database search was carried out covering the last three decades, i.e., 1990-2020. The literature search revealed that almost a dozen isolated phytoconstituents are being explored globally for their anti-trichomonal activity. Simultaneously, many countries have their own traditional or folk medicine for trichomoniasis that utilizes their native plants, as a whole, or even extracts. This review focuses mainly on the human parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. However, at some points mention is also made to Tritrichomonas foetus that causes trichomoniasis in animals of high veterinary and economical interest. We will focus on the plants and plant-based compounds and their anti-trichomonal activity. The literature search highlighted that there are abundant compounds that possess anti-trichomonal activity; however, in-depth in-vivo evaluation of compounds and their clinical evaluation has not been undertaken. There is a critical need for new anti-trichomonal compounds, and focused research on phytoconstituents can provide the way forward.">

Therefore, we aimed to investigate some potential cold-pressed oils with attractive fatty acid profiles and high amounts of functional phytochemicals. Fifty cold-pressed plant oils were prepared from various plant materials in Thailand, in which some of them were from uncommon or unattended plant materials. The oils included were nut oils (n = 9), pseudo-cereal oils (n = 9), legume oils (n = 3), amaranth oils (n = 3), marrow seed oils (n = 8), cruciferous seed oils (n = 7), and leafy green seed oils (n = 11). Gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry (GC-MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) were employed to analyze fatty acid profile and five functional phytochemicals (e.g., phytosterols, cholecalciferol, and squalene). Saturated fatty acids were detected around 7.87-36.04%, monounsaturated fatty acids 10.17-80.25%, and polyunsaturated fatty acids nondetectable (ND)-78.25%, phytosterols 663-15123 μg g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, squalene 265-5979 μg g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, and cholecalciferol ND-1287.75 μg g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. The study showed chemical characteristic of the analyzed oils: some contained good fatty acid composition and some were rich in functional phytochemical content. Among the obtained oils, marrow seed oils are a good source of phytosterol, cholecalciferol, and linoleic acid. Pseudo-cereal oils are rich in squalene and linolenic acid. Legume oils are rich in phytosterols and oleic acid. Besides, principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to identify the significance of oils that share compositional similarity (e.g., the samples from pseudo-cereal oil were found on the lower side of the PCA space, which separated them from marrow and leafy green seed oils distributed on the upper part of the plot). In summary, the qualitative and quantitative data would provide a good foundation for further application or selection of those plant oils for health purposes.">

Environmental damages, human health issues and the emergence of resistance are driving scientists to seeks alternatives to synthetic insecticides for its control. With low mammal toxicity and low persistence, essential oils are more and more being considered a potential alternative. In this study, we compare the toxicity of 25 essential oils, representing a large array of chemical compositions, on adult granary weevils. Bioassays indicated that &lt;i&gt;Allium sativum&lt;/i&gt; was the most toxic essential oil, with the lowest calculated lethal concentration 90 (LC90) both after 24 h and 7 days. &lt;i&gt;Gaultheria procumbens&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Mentha arvensis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus dives&lt;/i&gt; oils appeared to have a good potential in terms of toxicity/cost ratio for further development of a plant-derived biocide. Low influence of exposure time was observed for most of essential oils. The methodology developed here offers the possibility to test a large array of essential oils in the same experimental bioassay and in a standardized way. It is a first step to the development of new biocide for alternative management strategies of stored product pests.">

Their volatility minimizes the risk of residue but can also be a constraint if the release is rapid and uncontrolled. Solutions allowing the encapsulation of essential oils are therefore strongly researched. In this study, essential oils encapsulation was carried out within dendrimers to control their volatility. Indeed, a spontaneous complexation occurs in a solution of dendrimers with essential oils which maintains it longer. Six parameters (temperature, stirring rate, relative concentration, solvent volume, stirring time, and pH) of this reaction has been optimized by two steps: first a screening of the parameters that influence the encapsulation with a Plackett-Burmann design the most followed by an optimization of those ones by a surface response methodology. In this study, two essential oils with herbicide properties were used: the essential oils of &lt;i&gt;Cinnamomum zeylanicum&lt;/i&gt; Blume and &lt;i&gt;Cymbopogon&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;winterianus&lt;/i&gt; Jowitt; and four biosourced dendrimers: glycerodendrimers derived from polypropylenimine and polyamidoamine, a glyceroclikdendrimer, and a glyceroladendrimer. Meta-analysis of all Plackett-Burman assays determined that rate and stirring time were effective on the retention rate thereby these parameters were used for the surface response methodology part.

Fungi are of special interest because of their ability to produce mycotoxins with health concerns. Once grains are harvested, synthetic fungicides, which are sprayed before long-term storage, normally control fungi; however, these synthetic products represent a health concern because of their toxicities. Previously, we reported the antifungal activity of the essential oils extracted from &lt;i&gt;Porophyllum linaria&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Agastache mexicana&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Buddleja perfoliata&lt;/i&gt; against fungal strains isolated from stored wheat. In this study, we sprayed wheat grains with the same essential oils to measure their persistence interval and to prepare baked products to assess potential changes in their physical properties. The persistence interval of the essential oils in grains indicated that it takes between 63 and 134 days to eliminate 90% of the original compounds. This extended time of the compounds in the grains together with a lack of physical properties modifications of the flour and baked products (post-treatment) suggest that the presence of oils in the grains is potentially safe to use.

Poultry's digestibility is reported to be compromised due to the indigestion of the high fiber content, making PKC potentially low for poultry feeding. Nevertheless, solid-state fermentation (SSF) can be applied to improve the nutritional quality of PKC by improving the CP and reducing CF content. PKC also contains β-mannan polysaccharide, which works as a prebiotic. However, there is a wide variation for the inclusion level of PKC in the broiler diet. These variations may be due to the quality of PKC, its sources, processing methods and value-added treatment. It has been documented that 10-15% of treated PKC could be included in the broiler's diets. The inclusion levels will not contribute to a negative impact on the growth performances and carcass yield. Furthermore, it will not compromise intestinal microflora, morphology, nutrient digestibility, and immune system. PKC with a proper SSF process (FPKC) can be offered up to 10-15% in the diets without affecting broilers' production performance.">

        <span class="abst" title="The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an emerging situation with high rates of morbidity and mortality, in the pathophysiology of which inflammation and thrombosis are implicated. The disease is directly connected to the nutritional status of patients and a well-balanced diet is recommended by official sources. Recently, the role of platelet activating factor (PAF) was suggested in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. In the present review several micronutrients (vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin D, selenium, omega-3 fatty acids, and minerals), phytochemicals and Mediterranean diet compounds with potential anti-COVID activity are presented. We further underline that the well-known anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic actions of the investigated nutrients and/or holistic dietary schemes, such as the Mediterranean diet, are also mediated through PAF. In conclusion, there is no single food to prevent coronavirus Although the relationship between PAF and COVID-19 is not robust, a healthy diet containing PAF inhibitors may target both inflammation and thrombosis and prevent the deleterious effects of COVID-19. The next step is the experimental confirmation or not of the PAF-COVID-19 hypothesis.">

Maltodextrin: starch: flaxseed oil emulsions with FOCE or distilled water as liquid phases, and 10% and 20% of oil were spray-dried at 180 °C. The solubility, flowability, cohesiveness, bulk, and tapped densities of the spray-dried powders were analyzed. Additionally, the characteristics of initial and reconstituted emulsions, such as stability, creaming index, color, particle size, and rheological properties were evaluated. Results showed that FOCE could be an adequate emulsifier for spray-dried emulsions with a high oil content providing high stability after reconstitution, when compared to emulsions based only on maltodextrin-starch wall material with water as the liquid phase. This study showed an encouraging way for producing natural and plant-based spray-dried oil-loaded emulsions for food applications.">

Although the percentages of vegetarians and vegans are low compared to omnivores, their numbers have increased significantly in the last years. The use of non-animal food products other than meat alternatives is also increasing and this tendency constitutes an opportunity for the food industry. In this review, we present that plant-based meat and milk alternatives are consolidated but that there is a niche for egg, seafood alternatives, and new products which may not resemble any traditional animal food. However, not all animal food substitutes are sustainable and some of them are even ultra-processed. In addition, there are concerns on safety and labeling, and consumers demand clear information and regulation. The challenges in this field are connected with food design and technology, sensory science, nutrition, and dietetics. Moreover, adequate selection and combination of foods is important in order to achieve consumer acceptance while preventing nutritional deficiencies in those who choose this type of diet.">

We investigated DM as a natural capping agent for Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions and coloaded it with tryptophan for its penetration and antiobesity behavior. DM zinc oxide nanoparticles (DM-ZnO NPs) were prepared and then entrapped with tryptophan (DM-ZnO-Try nanoemulsion (NE)) for stable formulation using the O/W nanoemulsion method. The hydrodynamic sizes measured by dynamic light scattering for DM-ZnO NPs and DM-ZnO-Try NE are about 146.26 ± 3.31 and 151.16 ± 3.59 nm, respectively. TEM and SEM reveal its morphology. In vitro analysis on both NPs and NE was non-toxic to RAW 264.7 and 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line. It significantly reduced the accumulated lipids through lipolysis performed at 10 ug/mL in 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells. NE suppresses the differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes and lowers triglycerides. Further, the substantial reduction of lipid content is evident with Oil Red O staining and OD measurement. In this present study, the synergetic effect of DM-ZnO NPs and tryptophan is reported, which provides a way for more detailed research on its efficacy for obesity and obesity-associated disorders.">

Such major compounds were also detected in the vapor phase of all EOs, and α-pinene reached higher relative percentages than in the liquid phase. Then, both the liquid and vapor phases were evaluated in terms of antibacterial activity against three Gram-negative bacteria (&lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas fluorescens&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter bohemicus&lt;/i&gt;) and two Gram-positive bacteria (&lt;i&gt;Kocuria marina&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Bacillus cereus&lt;/i&gt;) using a microwell dilution assay, disc diffusion assay, and vapor phase test. The lowest Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) (13.28 mg/mL) and Minimal Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) (26.56 mg/mL) values, which correspond to the highest antibacterial activities, were reported for &lt;i&gt;P. abies&lt;/i&gt; EO against &lt;i&gt;A. bohemicus&lt;/i&gt; and for &lt;i&gt;A. alba&lt;/i&gt; EO against &lt;i&gt;A. bohemicus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B. cereus&lt;/i&gt;.

Protoscoleces of hydatid cysts were collected from liver fertile hydatid cysts of infected sheep and were then treated with various concentrations of the essential oil (75, 150, and 300 µL/mL) for 5-60 min in vitro and ex vivo. Then, by using the eosin exclusion test, the viability of the protoscoleces was studied. The caspase-3-like activity of the FMEO-treated protoscoleces was also evaluated through the colorimetric protease assay Sigma Kit based on the manufacturer's instructions.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;According to GC/MS, the main constituents of the essential oil were terpinolene (77.72%), n-nonanal (4.47%), and linalool (4.35%), respectively. In vitro, the maximum protoscolicidal activity of FMEO was observed at the concentrations of 150 and 300 µL/mL, such that 100% of the protoscoleces were killed after 30 and 20 min of exposure, respectively. Based on the obtained findings, the results demonstrate that FMEO required a longer time to kill protoscoleces ex vivo; after 12 min of exposure to FMEO, only 13.4% of the protoscoleces remained alive. After 48 h of the treatment of protoscoleces, FMEO, in a dose-dependent manner and at doses of 75, 150, and 300 µL/mL, induced the activation of the caspase enzyme by 24.3, 35.3, and 48.3%, respectively.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Our findings demonstrate the potent protoscolicidal effects of FMEO in vitro and ex vivo; however, further studies are required to assess the safety and the efficiency of FMEO as a promising scolicidal agent in a preclinical model and clinical setting.">

Sesamol, sesaminol, its epimers, and episesamin are transformation products found in processed products. Synthetic routes to all lignans are known but only sesamol is synthesized industrially. Biosynthesis of furofuran lignans begins with the dimerization of coniferyl alcohol, followed by the formation of dioxoles, oxidation, and glycosylation. Most genes of the lignan pathway in sesame have been identified but the inheritance of lignan content is poorly understood. Health-promoting properties make lignans attractive components of functional food. Lignans enhance the efficiency of insecticides and possess antifeedant activity, but their biological function in plants remains hypothetical. In this work, extensive literature including historical texts is reviewed, controversial issues are critically examined, and errors perpetuated in literature are corrected. The following aspects are covered: chemical properties and transformations of lignans; analysis, purification, and total synthesis; occurrence in &lt;i&gt;Seseamum indicum&lt;/i&gt; and related plants; biosynthesis and genetics; biological activities; health-promoting properties; and biological functions. Finally, the improvement of lignan content in sesame seeds by breeding and biotechnology and the potential of hairy roots for manufacturing lignans in vitro are outlined.">

As they are usually only pressed at low temperatures and filtered, without further processing stages (as refining), they preserve their character that originates from the plant the oil was extracted from. Coriander cold pressed oil is gaining popularity as a novel product, obtained from its fruits/seeds; due to the high amount of terpenes, it has very characteristic flavor. A novel, vacuum-assisted sorbent extraction (VASE) method was used to extract terpenes from coriander cold pressed oil. Optimal parameters were determined. The profile of compounds extracted using VASE was compared with that of classic hydrodistillation method. Moreover, 17 monoterpene hydrocarbons and alcohols were identified with β-linalool as the main compound, followed by α-pinene, γ-terpinene, camphor, sylvestrene, β-pinene, and o-cymene. Differences were noted between profiles of terpenes after hydrodistillation and VASE extraction. For 8 out of 17 terpenes, VASE was used for their quantitative analysis. Regarding simplicity of the method, small sample requirement (200 mg) and short extraction time (5 min), VASE combined with GC/MS is well suited for characterization of terpenes in such matrix as plant oils.">

        <span class="abst" title="Plant proteins are being considered to become the most important protein source of the future, and to do so, they must be able to replace the animal-derived proteins currently in use as techno-functional food ingredients. This poses challenges because plant proteins are oftentimes storage proteins with a high molecular weight and low water solubility. One promising approach to overcome these limitations is the glycation of plant proteins. The covalent bonding between the proteins and different carbohydrates created via the initial stage of the Maillard reaction can improve the techno-functional characteristics of these proteins without the involvement of potentially toxic chemicals. However, compared to studies with animal-derived proteins, glycation studies on plant proteins are currently still underrepresented in literature. This review provides an overview of the existing studies on the glycation of the major groups of plant proteins with different carbohydrates using different preparation methods. Emphasis is put on the reaction conditions used for glycation as well as the modifications to physicochemical properties and techno-functionality. Different applications of these glycated plant proteins in emulsions, foams, films, and encapsulation systems are introduced. Another focus lies on the reaction chemistry of the Maillard reaction and ways to harness it for controlled glycation and to limit the formation of undesired advanced glycation products. Finally, challenges related to the controlled glycation of plant proteins to improve their properties are discussed.">

With the lack of new chemical classes of insecticides to control mosquito populations, the development of novel synergists may improve the performance of available insecticides. We screened a set of 20 plant essential oils alone and in combination with natural pyrethrins against &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; (Orlando) female adult mosquitoes to assess their ability to synergize this natural insecticide. A co-toxicity factor analysis was used to identify whether plant oils modulated the toxicity of natural pyrethrins antagonistically, additively, or synergistically. Both knockdown at 1 h and mortality at 24 h were monitored. A majority of oils increased the toxicity of natural pyrethrins, either via an additive or synergistic profile. Many oils produced synergism at 2 µg/insect, whereas others were synergistic only at the higher dose of 10 µg/insect. Amyris, cardamom, cedarwood, and nutmeg East Indies (E.I.) oils were the most active oils for increasing the mortality of natural pyrethrins at 24 h with co-toxicity factors greater than 50 at either or both doses. A number of oils also synergized the 1 h knockdown of natural pyrethrins. Of these, fir needle oil and cypress oils were the most successful at improving the speed-of-action of natural pyrethrins at both doses, with co-toxicity factors of 130 and 62, respectively. To further assess the co-toxicity factor method, we applied selected plant essential oils with variable doses of natural pyrethrins to calculate synergism ratios. Only the oils that produced synergistic co-toxicity factors produced statistically significant synergism ratios. This analysis demonstrated that the degree of co-toxicity factor correlated well with the degree of synergism ratio observed (Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.94 at 2 µg/insect; r = 0.64 at 10 µg/insect) and that the co-toxicity factor is a useful tool in screening for synergistic activity.">

        <span class="abst" title="Health food has become a prominent force in the market place, influencing many food industries to focus on numerous bioactive compounds to reap benefits from its properties. Use of these compounds in food matrices has several limitations. Most of the food bio-additives are sensitive compounds that may quickly decompose in both food and within the gastrointestinal tract. Since most of these bioactives are highly or partially lipophilic molecules, they possess very low water solubility and insufficient dispersibility, leading to poor bioavailability. Thus, various methods of microencapsulation of large number of food bioactives have been studied. For encapsulation of hydrophobic compounds several lipid carriers and lipid platforms have been studied, including emulsions, microemulsions, micelles, liposomes, and lipid nano- and microparticles. Solid lipid particles (SLP) are a promising delivery system, can both deliver bioactive compounds, reduce their degradation, and permit slow and sustained release. Solid lipid particles have important advantages compared to other polymer carriers in light of their simple production technology, including scale up ability, higher loading capacity, extremely high biocompatibility, and usually low cost. This delivery system provides improved stability, solubility in various matrixes, bioavailability, and targeting properties. This article reviews recent studies on microencapsulation of selected bioactive food ingredients in solid lipid-based carriers from a point of view of production methods, characteristics of obtained particles, loading capability, stability, and release profile.">

In this regard, the use of edible films and coatings have gained much attention due to their ability to prevent the spoilage of the food products during handling, transport, and storage. This has effectively helped in extending the shelf-life of the food products. Among the various polymers, polysaccharides have been explored to develop edible films and coatings in the last decade. Such polymeric systems have shown great promise in microbial food safety applications. The inclusion of essential oils (EOs) within the polysaccharide matrices has further improved the functional properties of the edible films and coatings. The current review will discuss the different types of polysaccharides, EOs, methods of preparing edible films and coatings, and the characterization methods for the EO-loaded polysaccharide films. The mechanism of the antimicrobial activity of the EOs has also been discussed in brief.">

As per the current scenario, there is an urgent need for antiviral that could act as a protective and therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2. Previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is much similar to the SARS-CoV bat that occurred in 2002-03. Since it is a zoonotic virus, the exact source is still unknown, but it is believed bats may be the primary reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 through which it has been transferred to humans. In this review, we have tried to summarize some of the approaches that could be effective against SARS-CoV-2. Firstly, plants or plant-based products have been effective against different viral diseases, and secondly, plants or plant-based natural products have the minimum adverse effect. We have also highlighted a few vitamins and minerals that could be beneficial against SARS-CoV-2.">

The capability of the essential oil (EO) from inflorescences as antimicrobial agent has been reported. However, literature data are still lacking about the hemp EO antiprotozoal efficacy in vivo. The present study aims to unravel this concern through the evaluation of the efficacy of hemp EOs (2.5 mL/kg, intraperitoneally) of three different cultivars, namely &lt;i&gt;Futura 75&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Carmagnola selezionata&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Eletta campana&lt;/i&gt;, in mice intraperitoneally infected with &lt;i&gt;Leishmania tropica&lt;/i&gt;. A detailed description of EO composition and targets-components analysis is reported. Myrcene, α-pinene and &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;-caryophyllene were the main components of the EOs, as indicated by the gas-chromatographic analysis. However, a prominent position in the scenario of the theoretical interactions underlying the bio-pharmacological activity was also occupied by selina-3,7(11)-diene, which displayed affinities in the micromolar range (5.4-28.9) towards proliferator-activated receptor α, cannabinoid CB2 receptor and acetylcholinesterase. The content of this compound was higher in &lt;i&gt;Futura 75&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Eletta campana&lt;/i&gt;, in accordance with their higher scavenging/reducing properties and efficacy against the tissue wound, induced by &lt;i&gt;L. tropica&lt;/i&gt;. Overall, the present study recommends hemp female inflorescences, as sources of biomolecules with potential pharmacological applications, especially towards infective diseases.">

The chemical composition of essential oils was determined by GC-MS and GC-FID, while extracts (phenolic acids and flavonoids fractions) were analyzed by HPLC-DAD. Based on given volatiles, the investigated subspecies represented two chemotypes: a carvacrol/γ-terpinene/&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-cymene type in the case of Greek oregano and a sabinyl/cymyl type rich in terpinen-4-ol in common oregano. Within non-volatile phenolic compounds, rosmarinic acid appeared to dominate in both subspecies. Lithospermic acid B, chlorogenic acid and isovitexin were present only in Greek oregano extracts. However, the total content of flavonoids was higher in common oregano extracts. The essential oil and extract of Greek oregano revealed visibly stronger antibacterial activity (expressed as MIC and MBC) than common oregano, whereas the antioxidant potential (determined by DPPH, ABTS and FRAP) of these extracts was almost equal for both subspecies. In the case of &lt;i&gt;Origanum&lt;/i&gt; plants, the potential application of essential oils and extracts as antiseptic and antioxidant agents in the food industry should be preceded by subspecies identification followed by recognition of their chemotype concerning both terpene and phenolics composition.">

Fish leftovers and their processing byproducts represent a significant portion of the original fish, and their disposal has a high environmental and economic impact. The utilization of waste as raw materials for the production of different classes of biofuels and high-value chemicals, a concept known as &quot;biorefinery&quot;, is gaining interest in a vision of circular economy and zero waste policies. In this context, an interesting route of valorization is the extraction of omega-3 fatty acids (ω-3 FAs) for nutraceutical application. These fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have received attention over the last decades due to their beneficial effects on human health. Their sustainable production is a key process for matching the increased market demand while reducing the pressure on marine ecosystems and lowering the impact of waste production. The high resale value of the products makes this waste a powerful tool that simultaneously protects the environment and benefits the global economy. This review aims to provide a complete overview of the sustainable exploitation of fish waste to recover ω-3 FAs for food supplement applications, covering composition, storage, and processing of the raw material.">

The purpose of this study was to explore in vitro antioxidant, thrombolytic activities, and in vivo neuropharmacological effects of methanolic extract of &lt;i&gt;Homalomena aromatica&lt;/i&gt; (MEHA) leaves. Antioxidant activity of MEHA was assessed by a DPPH free radical scavenging assay and total phenolics content, total flavonoids content were also measured. The thrombolytic activity was determined by percentage of clot lysis and neuropharmacological activities by hole board, tail suspension, forced swimming and elevated plus maze tests. The results showed that the IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of the extract against DPPH was 199.51 μg/mL. Quantitative analysis displayed higher contents of phenolics and flavonoids (147.71 mg gallic acid equivalent/g &amp; 66.65 mg quercetin equivalent/g dried extract, respectively). The extract also showed a significant clot lysis (33.31%) activity. In case of anxiolytic activity, the elevate plus maze (EPM) test demonstrated an increase in time spent in open arms, and in case of hole board test, the number of head dipping was also significantly increased (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05). All the test compared with control (1% Tween in water) and standard (diazepam 1 mg/kg), significant dose (200 &amp; 400 mg/kg) dependent anxiolytic activity was found. In antidepressant activity, there was a significant decrease in period of immobility in both test models (tail suspension and forced swimming) (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05). Moreover, 13 compounds were identified as bioactive, showed good binding affinities to xanthine oxidoreductase, tissue plasminogen activator receptor, potassium channel receptor, human serotonin receptor targets in molecular docking experiments. Furthermore, ADME/T analysis revealed their drug-likeness, likely pharmacological actions and non-toxic upon consumption. Taken together, our finding support the traditional medicinal use of this plant, which may provide a potential source for future drug discovery.">

Relatively high amounts of oxygenated sesquiterpenes (44.4-70.2%) were detected, mainly consisting of caryophyllene oxide (13.1-26.6%), carotol (9.2-21.2%),14-hydroxy-9-&lt;i&gt;epi&lt;/i&gt;-(&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-caryophyllene (3.2-15.5%) and humulene epoxide II (2.6-7.2%). The cytotoxic activity against human mammary carcinoma cell lines (MDA-MB-231) and colorectal carcinoma cell lines (SW620) of the essential oil and its fractions were assessed. All the samples displayed moderate to weak activity compared to 5-fluorouracil. The colorectal carcinoma cell line was relatively more sensitive to the essential oil and its fractions compared to the breast cancer cell line, showing IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values from 25.7 to 96.5 μg/mL. In addition, the essential oil and its fraction E.2 revealed a cytotoxic activity against colorectal carcinoma cell line, with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values lower than 30 μg/mL.

        <span class="abst" title="Bovine mastitis is the most widespread and economically important disease worldwide. The present study aimed to determine bioactive compounds in two essential oils (EOs) from wild &lt;i&gt;(Thymus serpyllum)&lt;/i&gt; and common thyme &lt;i&gt;(Thymus vulgaris)&lt;/i&gt; and to assess the antioxidant potential as well as antibacterial efficacy of the EOs against mastitis-associated bacteria. The study also included antibiotic susceptibility tests. The strains were previously isolated from lactating animals with clinical and subclinical mastitis. The antioxidant potential of the commercial EOs of wild and common thyme was evaluated by five in vitro assays. The antibacterial activity was performed using the microdilution technique, while antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. The dominant compound in wild thyme was thymol (45.22%), followed by &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-cymene (23.83%) and γ-terpinene (3.12%), while in common thyme, it was thymol (54.17%), followed by γ-terpinene (22.18%) and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-cymene (16.66%). Among the fourteen mastitis-associated bacteria, strain IX &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/i&gt; spp. (β-hemolytic) was the most sensitive to the tested EOs (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)/minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) were 0.78/1.56 and 0.39/0.78 mg/mL for &lt;i&gt;T. serpyllum&lt;/i&gt; (TS) and &lt;i&gt;T. vulgaris (TV)&lt;/i&gt;, respectively). Regarding &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/i&gt; spp. β heamoliticus, MICs for &lt;i&gt;TS&lt;/i&gt; ranged from 0.78 to 1.56 mg/mL, while for the same oil, MBCs ranged from 1.56 to 12.5 mg/mL. In the case of &lt;i&gt;T. vulgaris,&lt;/i&gt; MICs ranged from 0.39 to 3.125 mg/ mL, while MBCs ranged from 3.125 to 6.25 mg/mL. TV is more active against &lt;i&gt;E. coli, E. sakazakii,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/i&gt; spp., while it is less effective against &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus&lt;/i&gt; spp. than TS. The study revealed that the tested EOs possess remarkable antioxidative and antibacterial activities and could be used in the development of pharmaceutical formulation as an alternative to conventional mastitis therapy.">

HL-60R cell lines are characterized by the overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) and constitutive expression of NF-κB. EO chemical composition was determined by GC/MS analysis; cytotoxic activity of EO by MTS assay alone or in combination with doxorubicin; pro-apoptotic effect and doxorubicin accumulation were analyzed by flow cytometry; P-gp ATPase activity was measured by P-gp-Glo™ assay systems kit. The ability to inhibit NF-κB and its target genes was also assessed. &lt;i&gt;E. intisy&lt;/i&gt; EO exhibited a comparable cytotoxic effect and ability to block P-gp in both the HL-60 and its MDR variant HL-60R. In addition, EO suppressed P-gp protein expression and significantly downregulated MDR1 mRNA level, as well as some IAPs proteins, probably through the inhibition of NF-κB. Our results suggest that &lt;i&gt;E. intisy&lt;/i&gt; EO could reverse P-gp-mediated drug resistance in tumor cells acting as a chemosensitizing agent.">

In addition to economic value, many of these phytochemicals have medicinal and physiological activity. The plant is most popularly known for its two most-prominent and most-studied secondary metabolites-Δ&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;-THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). Both Δ&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;-THC and CBD have a wide therapeutic window across many ailments and form part of a class of secondary metabolites called cannabinoids-of which approximately over 104 exist. This review will focus on non-cannabinoid metabolites of &lt;i&gt;Cannabis sativa&lt;/i&gt; that also have therapeutic potential, some of which share medicinal properties similar to those of cannabinoids. The most notable of these non-cannabinoid phytochemicals are flavonoids and terpenes. We will also discuss future directions in cannabis research and development of cannabis-based pharmaceuticals. Caflanone, a flavonoid molecule with selective activity against the human viruses including the coronavirus OC43 (HCov-OC43) that is responsible for COVID-19, and certain cancers, is one of the most promising non-cannabinoid molecules that is being advanced into clinical trials. As validated by thousands of years of the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes, vast anecdotal evidence abounds on the medicinal benefits of the plant. These benefits are attributed to the many phytochemicals in this plant, including non-cannabinoids. The most promising non-cannabinoids with potential to alleviate global disease burdens are discussed.">

Phytochemicals derived from mint also showed anticancer activity against different types of human cancers such as cervix, lung, breast and many others. Mint essential oils show a great cytotoxicity potential, by modulating MAPK and PI3k/Akt pathways; they also induce apoptosis, suppress invasion and migration potential of cancer cells lines along with cell cycle arrest, upregulation of Bax and p53 genes, modulation of TNF, IL-6, IFN-γ, IL-8, and induction of senescence phenotype. Essential oils from mint have also been found to exert antibacterial activities against &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;, and many others.

Modern pesticide application equipment includes plant protection unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are used widely for spraying defoliants. However, commonly used defoliant formulations are mainly suspension concentrates and water-dispersible granules, which need to be diluted with water when used. These are not suitable for plant protection UAVs with limited load capacity, especially in arid areas such as Xinjiang, China. Therefore, we prepared a thidiazuron·diuron ultra-low-volume (ULV) spray, which can be used directly without dilution in water. We found that ULV sprays had better wettability than the commercially available suspension concentrate, could quickly wet cotton leaves and spread fully. The volatilization rate was lower. ULV sprays also showed better atomization performance and more uniform droplet distribution than the commercially available suspension concentrate. At a dosage of 4.50-9.00 L/ha, the coverage rate on cotton leaves was 0.85-4.15% and droplet deposition densities were 15.63-42.57 pcs/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; defoliation rate and spitting rate were also greater than those of the reference product.

While information on contact, residual, and fumigant toxicity of plant-essential oils against bed bugs have been recently published, there is a gap of information regarding the repellent activity of these products and their constituents. Identification of essential oil constituents (EOCs) with repellent activity will help develop potentially efficacious essential oil-based formulations for use in bed bug management programs. In this study, we first screened fresh and 24 h-aged residues of geraniol, eugenol, carvacrol, thymol, citronellic acid, linalool, menthone, trans-cinnamaldehyde, α-pinene, β-pinene, and limonene for avoidance behavior from individual bed bugs with a video-tracking system. Six EOCs, geraniol, eugenol, citronellic acid, thymol, carvacrol, and linalool were further evaluated overnight in choice tests to determine whether 24-h aged residues were still avoided by groups of bed bugs. While bed bugs avoided resting on filter papers treated with 24-h aged residues of geraniol, eugenol, citronellic acid, and carvacrol, bed bugs aggregated in areas treated with linalool-aged residues. Barriers of EOCs did not prevent bed bugs from reaching a warmed blood source and acquiring blood meals. Our results show that novel formulations of natural product insecticides that include geraniol, eugenol, carvacrol, or citronellic acid have potential to repel bed bugs. The presence of host-associated cues might interfere with these responses.">

A new blue mold (&lt;i&gt;Penicillium polonium&lt;/i&gt;) was recorded for the first time on JA tubers. Penicillium mold was isolated, identified (morphologically, and molecularly), and deposited in GenBank; (MW041259). The fungus has a multi-lytic capacity, facilitated by various enzymes capable of severely destroying the tuber components. An economic oil-based procedure was applied for preserving and retaining the nutritive value of JA tubers under storage conditions. Caraway and clove essential oils, at a concentration of 2%, were selected based on their strong antifungal actions. JA tubers were treated with individual oils under storage, kept between peat moss layers, and stored at room temperature. Tubers treated with both oils exhibited lower blue mold severity, sprouting and weight loss, and higher levels of carbohydrates, inulin, and protein contents accompanied by increased levels of defense-related phytochemicals (total phenols, peroxidase, and polyphenol oxidase). Caraway was superior, but the results endorse the use of both essential oils for the preservation of JA tubers at room temperature, as an economic and eco-safe storage technique against the new blue mold.">

Scientific data supporting the efficacy of EOs as anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and antioxidant molecules accumulates over time; however, the cumulative evidence is not always sufficient. EOs antioxidant properties have been investigated mainly from human perspectives. Still, so far, our review is the first to combine the beneficial supporting properties of EOs in a One Health approach and as an animal product quality enhancer, opening new possibilities for their utilization in the livestock and nutrition sectors. We aim to compile the currently available data on the main anti-inflammatory effects of EOs, whether encapsulated or not, with a focus on mammary gland inflammation. We will also review the EOs' antioxidant activities when given in the diet or as a food preservative to counteract oxidative stress. We emphasize EOs' in vitro and in vivo ruminal microbiota and mechanisms of action to promote animal health and performance. Given the concept of DOHaD (Developmental Origin of Health and Diseases), supplementing animals with EOs in early life opens new perspectives in the nutrition sector. However, effective evaluation of the significant safety components is required before extending their use to livestock and veterinary medicine.">

Math models are useful in describing the growth, survival, and inactivation of microorganisms against antimicrobials. We evaluated the antimicrobial activity of &lt;i&gt;Melaleuca armillaris&lt;/i&gt; EO obtained from plants placed in the province of Buenos Aires (Argentina) against &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus.&lt;/i&gt; The minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations were close and decreased, slightly acidifying the medium from pH 7.4 to 6.5 and 5.0. This result was also evidenced by applying a sigmoid model, where the time and EO concentration necessaries to achieve 50% of the maximum effect decreased when the medium was acidified. Moreover, at pH 7.4, applying the Gompertz model, we found that subinhibitory concentrations of EO decreased the growth rate and the maximum population density and increased the latency period concerning the control. Additionally, we established physicochemical parameters for quality control and standardization of &lt;i&gt;M. armillaris&lt;/i&gt; EO. Mathematical modeling allowed us to estimate key parameters in the behavior of &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Melaleuca armillaris&lt;/i&gt; EO at different pH. This is interesting in situations where the pH changes are relevant, such as the control of intracellular infections in public health or the development of preservatives for the food industry.">

The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect on the larvicidal action when artificially varying the chemical composition of orange oil (&lt;i&gt;Citrus sinensis&lt;/i&gt; L.). As results, we found that the analysis of gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry showed the presence of terpenoid and sesquiterpenoid compounds in the different samples. The use of electric pulses on samples modified their chemical composition, so that the percentage of limonene went from 72% in the sample that was not subjected to electric treatment to lower percentages, even in sample three the percentage of limonene was &lt;50%. Only three compounds (limonene, linalool and caryophyllene) were found to be common in all samples. Subsequently, the larvicidal action on &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; larvae was evaluated. Six concentrations of each oil sample were tested (0, 100, 500, 1000, 5000 and 10000 ppm). We found that there was no linear relationship between concentration and lethality. Additionally, in the sample without electrical treatment most of the concentrations tested had lethality higher than 50%, while in sample 7 the results of the lethality were lower than 30%, so that biological tests showed that in samples where the concentration of limonene was lower, the lethality in the larvae decreased.">

        <span class="abst" title="Colombia is experiencing significant growth in its agricultural areas, its diverse production chains make the country an excellent candidate in the development of biorefineries, and as a result, there is an increasing need to take full advantage of biomass and obtain high value-added by-products from waste. In this sense, biorefineries are presented as a great alternative for the use of biomass; however, the methodologies of biorefinery synthesis lack a parameter that limits the growth of production lines under incremental exergetic and economic returns. This research develops a biorefinery synthesis methodology using an African palm biorefinery as a case study; a novel approach is developed to facilitate a stop criterion for biorefinery expansion through a combined consideration of economic incremental returns (IROI) and exegetical returns of investment (ExROI), avoiding unnecessary plant expansions or new processes that are not profitable or adequate in terms of useful energy. The development of this methodology required simulations in Aspen Plus software and technical-economic and exergetic evaluation with an incremental approach of four scenarios in Excel. The base case is palm oil production from African palm clusters. The second case includes the production of palm kernel oil and palm cake from residues. The third case implements the production of hydrogen based on other residues from the base case. The last case study incorporates the preceding case and the addition of biodiesel and glycerin production from palm oil. Case 3 exhibits a higher economic performance with an IROI of 42.98%; in terms of exergy, case 2 exhibits considerable improvements over the base case, with an ExROI of 158%. A parameter called the exergo-economic weighted incremental return on investment (IExWROI) was obtained, evidencing a 75% improvement in case 2 compared to the base case. The new indicator aims to provide a more comprehensive approach to biorefinery design by optimization of economic and exergetic returns, contributing a new alternative for decision-making in regard to plant design, plant expansion projects, and implementation of subprocesses.">

The outcomes evaluated: feed intake, performance, body development, blood cells and metabolites, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), rumen fermentation, fecal scores, and respiratory scores. All outcomes were evaluated during pre-weaning (4-60 d of age), and carry-over effects during post-weaning (61-90 d of age) periods. The experimental units utilized were 29 newborn Holstein × Gyr crossbred dairy heifers, with genetic composition of 5/8 or more Holstein and 3/8 or less Gyr and body weight (BW) at birth of 32.2 ± 5.2 kg. Experimental units were assigned to either a control (CON, n = 15) or a blend of essential oil supplementation (BEO, n = 14) treatment, maintaining a balance of genetic composition. The BEO was supplemented in the MR with 1 g/d/calf of a blend of essential oils (Apex Calf, Adisseo, China) composed by plant extracts derived from anise, cinnamon, garlic, rosemary, and thyme. During the pre-weaning phase, all heifers were fed 5 L of MR/d reconstituted to 15% (dry matter basis), divided into two equal meals. Water and starter were provided ad libitum. During the post-weaning, animals received a maximum of 3 kg of starter/d, and ad libitum corn silage, divided into two meals. Feed intake, fecal and respiratory scores were evaluated daily. The BW was measured every three days, while body development was recorded weekly. Blood samples were collected on 0, 30, and 60 d of age for total blood cell count, weekly and on the weaning day to determinate ß-hydroxybutyrate, urea and glucose, and biweekly for IGF-1. Ruminal parameters (pH, volatile fatty acids, ammonia-N, and acetate:propionate proportion-C2:C3) were measured on days 14, 28, 42, 60, 74 and 90. A randomized complete block design with an interaction between treatment and week was the experimental method of choice to test the hypothesis of the BEO's effect on all outcomes. An ANOVA procedure was used for continuous outcomes, and a non-parametric test was used for the ordered categorical outcomes, both adopting a CI = 95%. Results indicated that there was not enough evidence to accept the alternative hypothesis of the effect of BEO in MR on feed intake, performance, body development, and blood metabolites during both pre-weaning and post-weaning periods. However, results indicated that the inclusion of BEO in MR significantly affects the proportion of C2:C3 during pre- and post-weaning (P = 0.05). Similarly, the effect was significant for basophil (P ≤ 0.001), and platelet (P = 0.04) counts pre-weaning. The interaction between week and treatment was also significant for lymphocytes (P ≤ 0.001), revealing a cumulative effect. Lastly, fecal scores were also significant (P = 0.04) during pre-weaning, with lower values for BEO. The BEO contributed to ruminal manipulation in pre-weaning and carry-over effects in post-weaning, immunity improvement, and decreased morbidity of neonatal diarrhea in the pre-weaning phase.">

One of such plant materials that have been consumed to remedy the severity of this viral infection is the oil of &lt;i&gt;Nigella sativa&lt;/i&gt; seed commonly called black seed oil. In this study, we extracted and characterized the oil from this seed using gas chromatography coupled to a mass selective detector to identify the component phytochemicals.

The experimental protocol was designed using 30 healthy adult Wistar albino rats allocated into five groups containing six animals in each group. Group 1 was treated as normal control and groups 2, 3, 4, and 5 were treated with cadmium chloride (CdCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 3 mg/kg, IP) for 7 days. Group 3 was also treated with silymarin (100 mg/kg, PO) as a standard group, while groups 4 and 5 were administered with TSA oil at doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg PO, respectively. The nephrotoxicity was measured with various parameters such as kidney function markers, oxidative stress markers (glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA)), and messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression levels of inflammatory factors. The histological studies were also evaluated in the experimental protocol. The CdCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-treated groups showed a significant increase in the levels of serum kidney function markers along with MDA levels in kidney homogenate. However, renal GSH level was found to be reduced significantly. It was found that CdCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; significantly upregulated the nuclear factor levels of kappaB (NF-κB p65), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and small mothers against decapentaplegic (Smad2) as compared to the normal control group. On the other hand, TSA oil significantly improved the increased levels of serum kidney function markers, non-enzymatic antioxidants, and lipid peroxidation. In addition, TSA oil significantly downregulated the increased expression of NF-κB p65, iNOS, and Smad2 in Cd-intoxicated rats. Moreover, the histological changes in the tissue samples of the kidney of Cd-treated groups were significantly ameliorated in the silymarin- and TSA-oil-treated groups. The present study reveals that TSA oil ameliorates Cd-induced renal injury, and it is also proposed that the observed nephroprotective effect could be due to the antioxidant potential of TSA oil and healing due to its anti-inflammatory action.">

        <span class="abst" title="Chocolate is a complex soft material characterized by solid particles (cocoa powder, milk solid particles and sugar crystals) dispersed in a crystallized fat matrix mostly composed of cocoa butter (CB). Important chocolate properties such as snap, and visual appearance are strongly dependent on the internal molecular arrangement (polymorph), size and shape, as well as the spatial distribution of CB crystals within the chocolate mix. In recent years confectionary companies have put increasing effort in developing novel chocolate recipes to improve the nutritional profile of chocolate products (e.g., by reducing the amount of high saturated fat and sugar content) and to counteract the increasing price of cocoa butter as well as sustainability issues related to some chocolate ingredients. Different reformulation strategies can dramatically affect the crystallization thermodynamic and kinetic behaviour of cocoa butter; therefore, affecting the structural and sensorial properties of chocolate. In this review we analyse how different reformulation strategies affect the crystallization behaviour of cocoa butter and, hence, the structural and sensorial properties of chocolate. In particular, this work discusses the effect of: (1) CB replacement with emulsions, hydrogels, oleogels and oleofoams; (2) CB dilution with limonene or cocoa butter equivalents; (3) replacement or reduction of the amount of sugar and milk in chocolate. We found that there is certainly potential for successful novel alternative chocolate products with controlled crystalline properties; however, further research is still needed to ensure sensory acceptance and reasonable shelf-life of these novel products.">

The genomic regions at which selective sweeps are detected can reveal important information about signatures of selection. We have analyzed the genetic diversity within a soybean germplasm collection relevant for breeding in Europe (the EUCLEG collection), and have identified selective sweeps through a genome-wide scan comparing that collection to Chinese soybean collections. This work involved genotyping of 480 EUCLEG soybean accessions, including 210 improved varieties, 216 breeding lines and 54 landraces using the 355K SoySNP microarray. SNP calling of 477 EUCLEG accessions together with 328 Chinese soybean accessions identified 224,993 high-quality SNP markers. Population structure analysis revealed a clear differentiation between the EUCLEG collection and the Chinese materials. Further, the EUCLEG collection was sub-structured into five subgroups that were differentiated by geographical origin. No clear association between subgroups and maturity group was detected. The genetic diversity was lower in the EUCLEG collection compared to the Chinese collections. Selective sweep analysis revealed 23 selective sweep regions distributed over 12 chromosomes. Co-localization of these selective sweep regions with previously reported QTLs and genes revealed that various signatures of selection in the EUCLEG collection may be related to domestication and improvement traits including seed protein and oil content, phenology, nitrogen fixation, yield components, diseases resistance and quality. No signatures of selection related to stem determinacy were detected. In addition, absence of signatures of selection for a substantial number of QTLs related to yield, protein content, oil content and phenological traits suggests the presence of substantial genetic diversity in the EUCLEG collection. Taken together, the results obtained demonstrate that the available genetic diversity in the EUCLEG collection can be further exploited for research and breeding purposes. However, incorporation of exotic material can be considered to broaden its genetic base.">

Among the various non-thermal processing methods, ultrasound technology has proven to be very valuable. Ultrasound processing, being used alone or in combination with other processing methods, yields significant positive results on the quality of foods, thus has been considered efficacious. Food processes performed under the action of ultrasound are believed to be affected in part by cavitation phenomenon and mass transfer enhancement. It is considered to be an emerging and promising technology and has been applied efficiently in food processing industry for several processes such as freezing, filtration, drying, separation, emulsion, sterilization, and extraction. Various researches have opined that ultrasound leads to an increase in the performance of the process and improves the quality factors of the food. The present paper will discuss the mechanical, chemical and biochemical effects produced by the propagation of high intensity ultrasonic waves through the medium. This review outlines the current knowledge about application of ultrasound in food technology including processing, preservation and extraction. In addition, the several advantages of ultrasound processing, which when combined with other different technologies (such as microwave, supercritical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, high pressure processing, enzymatic extraction, etc.) are being examined. These include an array of effects such as effective mixing, retention of food characteristics, faster energy and mass transfer, reduced thermal and concentration gradients, effective extraction, increased production, and efficient alternative to conventional techniques. Furthermore, the paper presents the necessary theoretical background and details of the technology, technique, and safety precautions about ultrasound.">

        <span class="abst" title="Edible vegetable oils can provide most of the fatty acids, vitamin E, and certain phytochemicals necessary in the daily human diet to facilitate the required physiological activities. However, there are many types of edible vegetable oils on the market, and evaluating their nutritional quality is a matter of significant interest to consumers and producers. Most of the existing research studies that comparatively analyze and qualitatively describe the type, content, and proportion of nutrients in edible vegetable oil lack a comprehensive method for evaluating the nutritional quality of edible vegetable oil. Based on the physical and chemical analysis of fatty acids, vitamins, and phytochemicals in edible vegetable oil, this study aims to establish a model for a comprehensive evaluation of the nutritional quality of edible vegetable oils. The characteristic nutrients in edible vegetable oil were screened as the evaluation index, while the 2013 China Dietary Reference Intake and French Population Reference Intakes For Fatty Acids was considered the evaluation threshold. When each evaluation index in the edible vegetable oil reached the range stipulated by the reference intake of dietary nutrients, the index will get 1 point. The total score of each index was accumulated to evaluate the nutritional quality of the edible vegetable oils comprehensively. In this study, 13 edible vegetable oils, including low erucic acid rapeseed oil (in America, people usually call it canola oil), soybean oil, peanut oil, sunflower seed oil, flaxseed oil, edible blend oil, olive oil, palm oil, corn oil, camellia oil, peony seed oil, sacha inchi oil, and sesame oil, were selected as the evaluation objects because they are very common in China. Seven evaluation indexes were found for total saturated fatty acids (SFAs), atherogenic fatty acids (SFAs with 12, 14, and 16 carbon chains), monounsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids like linoleic acid and α-linolenic acid, vitamin E, and phytosterol. When the evaluation index met the evaluation threshold, it was scored 1 point. Scores ranged from 2 to 6. The highest scores were obtained from peony seed oil, flaxseed oil, low erucic acid rapeseed oil, and edible blend oil all of which were 6 points. The lowest score belonged to palm oil at 2 points. The higher the score, the higher the degree of satisfaction between the various nutrients in the edible vegetable oil and the dietary reference intake of this model is. This paper establishes a new method for the nutritional evaluation of edible vegetable oils, which is convenient for comparing the overall nutritional quality of different kinds of edible vegetable oils while providing a new technique for the extensive evaluation of edible vegetable oil.">

Hence, this review is an effort to retrieve the traditional usage of Cannabis sativa as a phytomedicine from published ethnomedicinal studies.&lt;h4&gt;Methods and materials&lt;/h4&gt;Information was searched by using the search terms &quot;ethnomedicinal Cannabis sativa and Bangladesh&quot;; &quot;Bangladesh cannabaceae and ethnomedicinal survey&quot;; &quot;ganja, bhang and folk medicine Bangladesh&quot;; &quot;tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabinoid and therapeutic, clinical trial&quot;; and &quot;cannabis and pharmacological/biological&quot; and retrieved from ethnobotanical articles available on PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and Google Scholar databases. A search of the relevant scientific literature also was conducted to assess the efficacy of the ethnomedicinal usage of Cannabis sativa.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;While reviewing over 200 ethnomedicinal plants' survey articles, we found that FMPs of Bangladesh from 12 different districts used Cannabis sativa to treat cited ailments like sleep-associated problems (n=5), neuropsychiatric and CNS problems (n=5), and infections and respiratory problems (n=5) followed by rheumatism, gastrointestinal, gynecological (n=4 each), cancer, sexual, and other ailments including hypertension, headache, itch, increases bile secretion, abortifacient, dandruff, fever, and urinary problems (n=1 each). There are a total of 15 formulations identified from the 11 out of 18 ethnomedicinal plant survey reports.
