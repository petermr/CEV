0: All the microtiter plates were incubated at 34 A 1 AC for 18 h (bacteria and  C. albicans) and for 72 h ( T. mentagrophytes).
1: The MICs values were recorded as the lowest concentration of the essential oils that inhibited visible growth of the tested microorganisms.
2: In order to determine the minimal bactericidal/fungicidal concentration (MBC/MFC), after recording the MIC endpoint, the concentrations equal to and higher than MIC were subcultured (10 AL) on Trypticase Soy Agar (TSA; OXOID, UK)abacteria, and SDAafungi.
3: The MBC was defined as the lowest concentration at which no growth was observed.
4: All the tests were performed in duplicate and the antimicrobial activity was expressed as mean values A standard deviation (SD).
