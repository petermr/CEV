0: The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the essential oils was determined by employing the broth microdilution method in 96-well plates following EUCAST with some modifications for essential oils [ 43].
1: One hundred microliters of each dilution of the essential oil and sterile nutrient broth (for growth control) were distributed into the wells of the micro titer plates.
2: Each well was inoculated with 100 AL of a microbial suspension.
3: The final concentration of microorganisms was determined for all the strains by subculture of the growth control on TSA (bacteria) and SDA (fungi) plates.
