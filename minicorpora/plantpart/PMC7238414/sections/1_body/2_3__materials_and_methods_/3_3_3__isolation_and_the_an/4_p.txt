0: Identification of components was based on the comparison of their MS spectra with those of laboratory-made MS library, commercial libraries (NIST 98.1, Wiley Registry of Mass Spectral Data, 8th Ed.
1: and MassFinder 4.1, Hamburg, Germany) and with the literature data [ 41, 42] along with the retention indices (Rtx-1, MassFinder 4.1) associated with a series of alkanes with linear interpolation (C8-C26).
2: The quantitative analysis (expressed as percentages of each component) was carried out by peak area normalization measurements without correction factors.
