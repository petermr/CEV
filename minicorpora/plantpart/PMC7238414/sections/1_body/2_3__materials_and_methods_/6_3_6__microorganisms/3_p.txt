0: Filamentous fungi were inoculated on the Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA; OXOID, UK) and incubated at 34 AC for adequate formation of conidia.
1: The culture of the  T. mentagrophytes were covered with a sterile 0.9% NaCl solution supplemented with 0.1% Tween 80.
2: Then the conidia were carefully rubbed with a cotton swab and transferred to a sterile flask.
3: The suspension was homogenized, vortexed, and filtered.
4: The number of conidia (macroconidia and microconidia) in the suspension was determined using haemocytometer chamber as well as the serial dilution agar plating method.
5: Inoculum was examined for the presence of hyphae, and both macroconidia and microconidia were observed.
