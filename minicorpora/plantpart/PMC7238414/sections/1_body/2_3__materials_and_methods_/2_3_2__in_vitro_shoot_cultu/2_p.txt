0: The explants of both the species were placed in a Erlenmeyer flask with 50 mL of the solidified MS medium (Murashige and Skoog [ 39]) with plant growth regulatorsabenzylaminopurine (BAP; Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA; Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA), and gibberellic acid (GA 3; Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA), each at the concentration of 1.0 mg/L [ 23, 40].
1: The culture vessels were placed in a growth chamber (21 A 2 AC; with a 16 h light/8 h dark photoperiod; 55 Amol/m 2aTMs light) and subcultured every 5 weeks.
2: Multiplication of shoots via the axillary branching method on MS medium was repeated many times, using at least 10 explants per repetition.
3: Shoots were air dried.
