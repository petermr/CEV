0: We collected virgin males and females by removing adults as they emerged.
1: We used 120 newly emerged (<a24A h-old) virgin adults to do copulation test.
2: The male was placed in a Petri dish, and then immediately, a female was transferred.
3: Pairs were given 5A min to mate.
4: The pair's behavioral changes were monitored, and mating latency, the start of copulation, the start of a male kicking by female, and termination of copulation were recorded.
5: If a male does nothing during this time, it was recorded as male without tendency.
6: If a male tried to start copulation and female actively rejected males and prevent copulation, it was recorded as male rejection.
