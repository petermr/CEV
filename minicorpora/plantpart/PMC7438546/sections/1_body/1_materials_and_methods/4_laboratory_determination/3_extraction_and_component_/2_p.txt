0: GCaMS analysis was performed by Agilent coupled with a 6890N-5975I system equipped with flame ionization detector (FID) and a DB-5MS (30A m A 0.25A mm, 0.25 I14m film thickness).
1: The temperature program included a starting temperature of 70AC which was then increased to 250AC at the rate of 8AC min a1, and this temperature held for 15A min.
2: Detailed operating parameters are described by  Cui etA al.
3: (2019).
4: Qualitative identification of essential oil components was based on comparison of their retention times and mass spectra with the data in the Wiley and NIST electronic libraries as well as the authentic reference compounds that were reported in the published literature ( Zhao etA al., 2000).
5: The relative amount of each component was calculated by comparing its average peak area to the total areas.
