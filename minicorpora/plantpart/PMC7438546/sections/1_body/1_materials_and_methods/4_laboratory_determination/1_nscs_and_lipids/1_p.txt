0: Arabinose and galactose contents were determined on an Agilent 1200 liquid chromatograph with the following parameters: SHISEIDO C18 column (4.6 A 250.0A mm, 5 I14m); mobile phase: 0.1A mol L a1 pH 7.0 phosphate buffer solution, acetonitrile:water = 82:18 (v:v); flow rate 1.0A ml min a1; column temperature 25AC; injection volume 10 I14l; wavelength 245 nm (after degraded by 4A mol L a1 trifluoroacetic acid and derivatives with 1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolone).
1: Glucose, fructose, sucrose, and stachyose were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with the following parameters: Shodex NH2P column (250.0 A 4.6A mm, 5 I14m); mobile phase: acetonitrile:water = 75:25 (v:v); flow rate 1.0A ml min a1; injection volume 10 I14l; column temperature 35AC; detector: differential refractive index (DRI), temperature: 35AC.
2: The starch content was determined by an anthrone colorimetric method ( Osaki etA al., 1991).
3: The lipid content was determined by Soxhlet extraction as described in detail by  Ramluckan etA al.
