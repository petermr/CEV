0: Three chemicals used were: 0.1A mol L a1 hydrogen peroxide (H 2O 2), 1.0A mol L a1 (pHa2.4) acetic acid (CH 3COOH) and 1.0A mol L a1 sodium chloride (NaCl).
1: Distilled water was injected as a control.
2: Sixty trees of similar size, all without heartwood were selected for a single-tree plot experiment with 15 replicates for each treatment.
3: A tiny drill was used to detect which trees have or donaTMt have heartwood.
4: In May 2017, an injection hole of 1A cm diameter and 5A cm deep was drilled at a downward angle of 45A at 1.3A m from the ground on each tree.
5: An amount of 50A ml solution was injected into each tree over 8A h period with a 5A ml syringe, and the hole was sealed with a cork after injection.
