0: Five trees per treatment were harvested at one, three and six months after injection treatment.
1: At the same time, three trees with heartwood were selected to collect natural heartwood.
2: At each harvest, the trees were felled, and the boles were immediately dissected ( Figure 1).
3: Wood samples were sequentially collected from the cambium to the pith as shown in  Figure 1A.
4: In the dotted box, the normal sapwood was divided into positions I and II, and the discolored part was defined as position III.
5: These samples were immediately deactivated in a 600-W microwave oven for 90 s ( Hoch etA al., 2002), dried at 65AC to constant weight, ground and passed through a 50 mesh sieve, and stored in a refrigerator at 4AC for determination of NSCs and lipids.
