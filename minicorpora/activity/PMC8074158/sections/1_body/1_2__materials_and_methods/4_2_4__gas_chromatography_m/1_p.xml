<p>This procedure was performed with a Finnigan PolarisQ GC/MS ion trap Bench-top mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corporation, Walthman, MA, USA). All conditions were as above, except that the carrier gas was He at a linear velocity of 31.9 cm.s
 <sup>−1</sup> and DB-5MS (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm) capillary columns were used. The positive ion electron ionization mode was applied, with a mass range of 40–400 amu. Identification of compounds was based on comparisons with published MS data [
 <xref rid="B18-biomolecules-11-00605" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and a computer library search (the database was delivered together with the instrument) and by comparison of their Kovats indices with those of authentic references and with literature values [
 <xref rid="B18-biomolecules-11-00605" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The identification was confirmed with the aid of authentic samples. Kovats indices were calculated mainly from the GC-MS analysis results [
