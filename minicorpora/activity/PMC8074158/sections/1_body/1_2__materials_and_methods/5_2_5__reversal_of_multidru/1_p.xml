<p>The L5178 MDR cell line was grown in McCoy’s 5A medium containing 10% heating activated horse serum completed with 
 <sc>l</sc>-glutamine and antibiotics. The cells were adjusted to a density of 2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> mL, resuspended in serum-free medium, and distributed in 0.5 mL aliquots into Eppendorf centrifuge tubes. The tested oils were added at concentrations of 0.004; 0.04; 0.01; 0.02 μg/mL and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Verapamil
 <sup>®</sup> (10 μg/mL) was used as positive control; 10 µL of Rhodamine 123 (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) at final concentration of 5.2 μM was added and cells were incubated for another 20 min at 37 °C. After incubation, cells were washed twice and resuspended in 0.5 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to perform the assay. Fluorescence of the cell population was measured by flow cytometry, using a Becton Dickinson FACS can instrument (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) [
