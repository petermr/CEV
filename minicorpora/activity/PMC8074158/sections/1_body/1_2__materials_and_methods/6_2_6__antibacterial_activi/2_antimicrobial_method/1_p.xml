<p>The antimicrobial assay was carried out according to the disc diffusion method. The strains were maintained in BHI (brain heart infusion) broth at room temperature. Every bacterial inoculum (2.5 mL) was incubated in Mueller-Hinton broth (Britaina
 <sup>®</sup> Ref B0213705) at 37 °C for 18 h. The bacterial inoculum was diluted in sterile 0.85% saline to obtain turbidity visually comparable to a McFarland N° 0.5 standard (1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL). Every inoculum was spread over plates containing tryptic soy agar (TSA, Sigma Aldrich) and 0.1

The plates were left for 30 min at room temperature and then, incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The inhibitory zone around the disc was measured and expressed in mm. A positive control was also used to check the sensitivity of the tested organisms using: Ampicillin
 <sup>®</sup> (30 µg) and gentamycin
 <sup>®</sup> (30 µg); those are reference antibiotics commonly used to treat this kind of bacteria. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined only with microorganisms that displayed inhibitory zones. MIC was determined by dilution of the essential oil in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and pipetting 10 μL of each dilution onto a filter paper disc. Dilutions of the oil within a concentration range of 5–10 μg/mL were used in the assayed. MIC was defined as the lowest concentration that inhibited the visible bacterial growth [
