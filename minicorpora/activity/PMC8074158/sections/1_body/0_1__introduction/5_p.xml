<p>Previous phytochemical investigations have reported sesquiterpene lactones such as eudesmanolides and germacrolides as major class of chemical compounds present in 
 <italic>Montanoa</italic> species [

 <italic>Montanoa quadrangularis</italic> collected from a different location at 1800 m.a.s.l. in MÃ©rida-Venezuela. In this investigation, limonene, sabinene, 
 <italic>trans</italic>-caryophyllene, germacrene-
 <sc>d,</sc> and myrcene were identified as major components. Furthermore, the essential oil showed a significant inhibitory effect against Gram-negative bacteria, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, and
