<p>Essential oils of flowers, leaves, and stems analyzed in the present investigation showed myrcene, limonene, β-phellandrene, trans-sabinol, β-caryophyllene, and sabinene as main components. Regarding the reversal of multidrug resistance of tumor cells assay, MQL caused an increase in the fluorescence activity of the cells at 0.02 μL/mL. According to references consulted, the membrane structure may play a critical role in the MDR activities, the resistance modulator–lipid interaction may be an important factor in the mechanism of drug resistance reversal. In addition, MQF and MQL showed activity against 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> AG 100
 <underline>A</underline>, while MQS was only active against
