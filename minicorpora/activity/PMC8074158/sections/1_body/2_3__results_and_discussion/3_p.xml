<p>Previous investigations carried out with the essential oil of 
 <italic>M. quadrangularis</italic> collected from a different location in Mérida at 1800 m.a.s.l showed limonene (18.83%), sabinene (11.63%), α-pinene (9.90%), and α-tujene (9.27%) as main components from the essential oil of the flowers while the essential oil of the leaves was composed mainly by limonene (18.01%), 
 <italic>trans</italic>-caryophyllene (16.07%), germacrene-
 <sc>d</sc> (7.63%), and mircene (6.37%). [

 <italic>Montanoa grandiflora</italic> revealed β-phellandrene (6.63%) and α-pinene (2.70%) as major compounds. The essential oil of the stems showed β-phellandrene (7.74%), limonene (4.80%), α-pinene (4.43%), and citronellal (3.50%), while the leaves showed α-pinene (4.27%), β-phellandrene (4.22%), limonene (2.37%), and citronellal (2.82%) as main components [
