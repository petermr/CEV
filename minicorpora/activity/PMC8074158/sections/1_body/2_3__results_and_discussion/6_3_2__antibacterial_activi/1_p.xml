<p>The antiseptic properties of aromatic plants and their extracts have been recognized since antiquity and are still used in the medicine, food, and cosmetic industry. In the present experiment, 
 <italic>M. quadrangularis</italic> essential oils were investigated for their antibacterial properties in the agar disc diffusion assay. Five different bacterial strains were treated with the essential oils and the zones of inhibition were determined on TSA plates and TSA agar plates supplemented with Tween 20. MQF and MQL showed activity against 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> AG 100
 <underline>A</underline>, while MQS was only active against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> AG 100
 <underline>A</underline> on TSA agar plates experiments (
