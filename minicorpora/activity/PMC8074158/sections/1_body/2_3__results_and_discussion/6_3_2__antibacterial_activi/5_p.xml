<p>The mechanism of action of essential oil components is not fully understood, it is assumed that membrane disruption by the lipophilic components is involved in the antibacterial action. Certain components of essential oils can act as uncouplers, which interfere with proton translocation over a membrane vesicle and subsequently interrupt ADP phosphorylation. Specific terpenoids with functional groups, e.g., phenolic, alcohols or aldehydes, also interfere with membrane-integrated or associated enzyme-proteins, stopping their production or activity [

Gram-negative bacteria have intrinsic resistance against toxic components, since they have a permeability barrier against toxic agents. Hydrophobic macromolecules, such as essential oil constituents, are unable to penetrate the barrier. On the other hand, essential oils usually express low aqueous solubility, which prevents them from reaching a toxic level in cellular membranes [
