<p>The essential oils obtained from different parts (leaves, flowers and stems) of 
 <italic>Montanoa quadrangularis</italic> were investigated for their MDR modulator activity on human MDR1 gene transfected mouse lymphoma cell line. This cell line carries the 170 kDa 
 <italic>P</italic>-glycoprotein in its membrane, which ABC transporter can extrude the chemotherapeutic agent from the cells. Efflux pump-related multidrug resistance is a major obstacle of cancer treatment. Multidrug resistance modulators, which act via the inhibition of this mechanism, seem likely to bring solution for the problem. Verapamil
 <sup>®</sup> serves a good model for that purpose; however, the concentration applied as an MDR modulator is beyond the clinically achievable concentration. In the present investigation, cells were stained with Rhodamine 123 fluorescent dye and, after treating the cells with the essential oils, the fluorescence activities were measured by flow-cytometry. According to the results observed (
 <xref rid="biomolecules-11-00605-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), only MQL caused a similar increase in the fluorescence activity of the cells at 0.02 μL/mL concentration comparing to the Verapamil
 <sup>®</sup> value; however, it is considered a mild activity.
