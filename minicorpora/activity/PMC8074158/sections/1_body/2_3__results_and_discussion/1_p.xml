<p>Essential oils from fresh leaves (MQL), stems (MQS), and flowers (MQF) of 
 <italic>Montanoa quadrangularis</italic> were analyzed by GC and GC/MS techniques. A list of identified components along with their percentages of the total oil is given in 
 <xref rid="biomolecules-11-00605-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The three samples analyzed showed myrcene (13.5% MQF, 26.2% MQL, 13.6% MQS) and a mixture of limonene + β-phellandrene (27.8% MQF, 16.1% MQL, 12.2% MQS) among the main components; however, trans-sabinol (23.5% MQF), β-caryophyllene (14.7% MQL), and sabinene (22.3% MQS) were also observed in major proportions.
