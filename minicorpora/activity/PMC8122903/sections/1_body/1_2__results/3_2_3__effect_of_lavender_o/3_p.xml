<p>In agreement with this observation, only a limited effect on the cytokine production by human macrophages was observed. hMDMs were stimulated with lavender oil preparations, similarly as described for HaCaT cells, and gene expression of proinflammatory M1-phenotype-related TNF-α, IL-8, IL-6, and proregenerative M2 phenotype-related IL-10 was measured by real-time PCR. Gene expression levels of IL-6 and IL-8 were increased only by LO-C; 7-fold and 2-fold, respectively, when compared to the control. Some induction of TNF-α was observed at the 0.025% LO-SM, yet it was reduced to the control levels at higher concentrations of LO-SM. A weak induction of VEGF-A gene was noticeable, but again, the levels did not reach 2-fold induction. Interestingly, IL-10 expression was reduced ~2-fold, indicating that macrophages remained in M1 phenotype (

At the same time, ELISA tests of the cytokine levels in the cell media did not reveal any increase in IL-8 and TGF-β secretion, regardless of timepoint and lavender oil concentration used, indicating the lack of the direct effect of lavender oil preparations on the resting macrophages (
