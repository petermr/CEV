<p>To determine the influence of lavender oil on the production of proinflammatory cytokines and proregenerative growth factors, gene expression of the selected signaling molecules by HaCaT cells was investigated using real-time PCR. Cells were stimulated with lavender oil (LO-SM and LO-C; 0.1%) for 4 or 24 h, then RNA was isolated, cDNA was transcribed and used as template in RT-PCR. The results revealed significant induction of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and VEGF gene expression upon stimulation with lavender oil. IL-8 expression was enhanced nearly 4-fold. Both LO-SM and LO-C induced a 2-fold increase in IL-6, VEGF, and IL-1β gene expression. At the same time, EGF and TGF-β1 expression was not affected by the presence of the lavender oils (
