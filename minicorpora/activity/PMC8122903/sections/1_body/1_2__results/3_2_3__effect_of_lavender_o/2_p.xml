<p>To evaluate the changes in the HaCaT cytokine secretion to the culture medium, ELISA was performed 24-h post-stimulation. IL-8 levels were increased 50% to the level of 30 pg/mL for LO-SM at 0.1% concentration. A similar trend was observed for LO-C, however, the significance level was not achieved in the statistical analysis when compared to the control cells. This effect was accompanied by the significant increase in VEGF levels observed in medium, which reached 500 pg/mL in cell media treated with 0.1% full oil preparations, observed for both LO-SM and LO-C. The levels of IL-6 or TGF-β were unaffected upon stimulation with any preparation of lavender oil (

The measured medium concentrations of IL-1α, IL-1β were generally low, indicating the low potential of lavender oil for the proinflammatory stimulation of HaCaT cells.
