<p>Analysis of the cytokine secretion to the cell medium revealed similar trends as observed on the RNA level. LPS induced the IL-6 secretion to 800 pg/mL. However, the limiting effect of lavender oil was observed only with the in-house formulation LO-SM, which resulted in concentrations below 500 pg/mL. TNF-α levels were increased by the LPS stimulation to 1600 pg/mL, while both LO-SM and LO-C lowered the observed TNF-α release to 1000 pg/mL, again indicating the inflammation-limiting effect of lavender oil on human macrophages. At the same time, co-stimulation of IL-8 production by LPS and lavender oil was confirmed, as the LPS co-stimulation with either LO-SM or LO-C resulted in 4000 pg/mL of IL-8 secreted to the medium, compared to 2500 pg/mL for LPS-only. Lavender oil alone nor with LPS pretreatment did not stimulate TGF-β release from macrophages (
