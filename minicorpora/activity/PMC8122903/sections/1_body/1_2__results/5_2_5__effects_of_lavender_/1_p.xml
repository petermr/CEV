<p>Interestingly, the co-stimulation of the cells with the lavender oil and LPS significantly limited the macrophage proinflammatory response. It resulted in a 2500-fold increase in TNF-α (vs. 3500-fold increase during stimulation with LPS alone) and 3000-fold increase in IL-6 expression (vs. 7000-fold increase during stimulation with LPS alone). At the same time, expression of IL-8 by cells stimulated with LPS and lavender oil was additive, reaching 110-fold increase, compared to 80-fold for LPS alone. Both LO-SM and LO-C comparably hindered the proinflammatory gene expression. In parallel, the additive effect on IL-10 production was observed. LPS alone limited IL-10 gene expression by a 30%, while the co-stimulation with either LO-SM or LO-C reduced the IL-10 expression by 50% when compared to the untreated cells. Interestingly, although the LPS-alone lowered the expression of TGF-β, the cells seemed to be protected from the LPS-induced TGF-β production decrease during co-stimulation with lavender oils, retaining levels closer to the control sample, thus displaying a clear anti-inflammatory effect (
