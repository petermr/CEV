<p>The maximum concentration of lavender oil was optimized in the preliminary experiments, where up to 25% concentration was investigated. For the present study on full lavender oil, we observed complete cytotoxicity at 1.5% concentration, and these conditions were chosen for further evaluation and IC50% determination, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02458-f002">Figure 2</xref>. Serial dilutions were prepared in the cell culture medium from 25% of each preparation to 0.025% and were incubated with HaCaT cells for 24 h. The cell viability was then estimated by formazan crystal deposition and absorbance measurement at 570 nm. The results of the control cells incubated in the culture medium alone were used for the comparison and represented 100% cell viability. The general cytotoxicity of the oils was high, and already 0.4% LO-C caused a reduction of cell viability to 10% of the control sample, compared to the moderate reduction (36% of the control cell viability) for the same concentration of commercial preparation LO-SM (
