<p>The chromatogram of the commercial lavender oil sample (LO-C) allowed for the identification of 35 chromatographic peaks (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02458-f001">Figure 1</xref>A), of which 17 were peaks with a significant proportion (over 1% of the total peak area). The main identified peaks were respectively: linalool, representing 28.1% of the share in the chromatogram; and linalyl acetate (bergamol), with a share of 30.1%. Other substances identified in this sample were: caryophyllene—4.2% share, β-myrcene—3.9%, terpinen-4-ol—3.7%, lavandulyl acetate—3.4%, borneol 3.0%, neryl acetate—2.8%, and α-pinene—2.5%. Among others, constituting 1–2% of the sample, the following substances should be mentioned: β-pinene, eucalyptol (1,8-cineole),
