<p>In the tested self-manufactured lavender oil—LO-SM (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02458-f001">Figure 1</xref>B), chromatographic analysis allowed for the identification of 49 peaks, 14 more than in the commercial preparation. Fifteen of them were peaks with a significant proportion (&gt;1%). Similar to the commercial preparation of the lavender oil, linalool and linalyl acetate were the dominant peaks, although their share was smaller than in the previous sample—18.5 and 26.0%, respectively. Lavandulyl acetate was present in a significant amount—11.0%, when compared to the commercial sample (3.4%). Other identified substances with a &gt;2.0% share in the chromatogram peak area were: caryophyllene—4.0%, geraniol acetate—3.5%, eucalyptol 3.4%, 
 <italic>trans</italic>-ocimene—2.8%, terpinen-4-ol—2.7%, β-mircen—2.3%, borneol—2.0%, and α-terpinol—2.0%. The remaining substances with a share of 1–2% in the chromatogram were D-limonene, 
 <italic>cis</italic>-ocymene, β-fernesene, and neryl acetate,
