<p>Standard solutions of test substances were prepared by dissolving the appropriate amounts of compounds in dichloromethane and subsequently served to prepare the calibration curves. The range of the determined concentrations was about 500 ÷ 4000 µg/mL for linalool and linalyl acetate, for lavandulyl acetate—100 ÷ 1000 µg/mL, and for other substances—50–500 µg/mL. The validation parameters for individual substances are presented in
