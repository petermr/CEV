<p>As the presented quantitative analyzes show, the tested oil (LO-SM) differed from commercial oil. LO-SM oil had lower linalool content than LO-C oil (23.2 vs. 40.2%) and comparable linalyl acetate content (40.6 vs. 44.0%), while for lavandulyl acetate, this content was significantly higher (23.2 vs. 5.5%). In the case of substances present in trace amounts, the differences were smaller, although the share of (−)-
 <italic>trans</italic>-caryophyllene and (−)-geraniol was greater in the analyzed oil (LO-SM) than in commercial oil. No bornyl acetate was found in both oils, while isobornyl acetate was identified in trace amount.
