<p>ELISA measurement of the cell medium secreted IL-6 and IL-8 confirmed the synergy between LPS and lavender oil stimulation. Although LO-SM and LO-C stimulated IL-6 and IL-8 production by HaCaT cells, in accordance with the effect observed at the RNA level, in the presence of LPS the effect was strongly enhanced. LO-SM stimulated the release of IL-6 nearly 400-fold, while commercial preparation induced 100Ã— higher concentrations of IL-6 in the medium when compared to the control, reaching nearly 400 pg/mL and 100 pg/mL, respectively. Additionally, IL-8 secretion was synergistically enhanced. When incubated together with LPS, LO-SM and LO-C boosted the IL-8 production by the stimulated cells to 600 (LO-SM) or 300 pg/mL (LO-C), compared to the 40 (LO-SM) and 30 pg/mL (LO-C) induced by the lavender oil alone. Again, LPS alone did not stimulate secretion (IL-6) or induced only a moderate production (50 pg/mL IL-8) of the investigated cytokines by the HaCaT cells. Moreover, the proregenerative response of HaCaT cells was affected as well. Co-stimulation with LPS and lavender oil increased VEGF concentration in the culture medium to 1200 and 1000 pg/mL for LO-SM and LO-C, respectively. This effect, however, was additive rather than synergic, as both LPS and lavender oil alone stimulated VEGF secretion (
