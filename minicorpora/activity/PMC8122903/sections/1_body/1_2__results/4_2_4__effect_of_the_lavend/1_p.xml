<p>To investigate the effect of the lavender oil preparations on the inflammatory-stimulated epithelial and immune cells, we employed the model based on the stimulated HaCaT and macrophage cells. TLR4-interacting ligand, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> LPS, was used to activate cells prior to the lavender oil application. Co-stimulation of HaCaT cells with LPS and lavender oil resulted in the strong induction of the VEGF-A gene. Both preparations, LO-SM and LO-C, induced VEGF-A expression 3-fold, yet strikingly the presence of LPS exaggerated the effect further, allowing for the 15x (LO-SM) and 23x (LO-C) VEGF-A stimulation. Similarly, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 were synergistically upregulated by co-stimulation with LPS and lavender oil. In contrast, the expression of TGF-β was not affected at all (
