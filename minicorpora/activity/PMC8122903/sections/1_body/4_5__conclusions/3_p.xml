<p>Reported results indicate lavender oil has a strong potential to enhance the local, tissue-derived proinflammatory and proregenerative response, while simultaneously limiting the inflammatory stimulation of the immune system cells, with in-house preparation performing significantly better in the in vitro cell models. This effect may be attributed to the increased concentration of lavandulyl acetate and decreased linalool acetate in the in-house preparation. Further studies are required to delineate the role of the VEGF stimulation and inflammatory modulation in the lavender oil-supported wound healing and to validate the importance of the individual lavender oil components.</p>
