<p>The presented in vitro studies focused on the analysis of the responses of epithelial cells (HaCaT human keratinocyte line) and human monocyte-derived macrophages. Results showed the concentration-dependent induction of production of IL-6 and IL-8 by keratinocytes markedly increased during co-stimulation of cells with the bacterial LPS. Inflammatory reaction was fine-tuned, as TNF-Î± production in hMDM was limited in the presence of lavender oil in the LPS-stimulated macrophages. Additionally, the proregenerative response of HaCaT cells potentiated by the VEGF cytokine was induced as well.</p>
