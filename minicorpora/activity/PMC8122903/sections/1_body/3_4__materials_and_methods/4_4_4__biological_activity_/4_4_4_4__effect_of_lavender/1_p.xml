<p>Confluent cultures of HaCaT cells and fully differentiated hMDM cells (200 or 300 thousand cells respectively per well of a 24 well plate) were stimulated with different concentrations of lavender oil. In an alternative setup, cells were prepared in the same manner, but co-stimulated with 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> serotype O111:B4 LPS (SigmaAldrich) (concentration for HaCaT: 5 Âµg/mL, concentration for hMDM: 100 ng/mL) diluted in culture medium without supplements before the addition of the lavender oil preparations. After 4 and 24 h, cell media were collected, cells were washed with PBS and lysed with TRIzol reagent (ThermoFisher).
