<p>HaCaT cells were seeded on 96-well plates (50,000 cells/well) a day prior to the experiment. Cells were incubated with various lavender oil formulations at concentrations ranging 0–25%. After 4 and 24 h, the medium was removed, cells were incubated with 200 uL/well of 0.5 mg/mL MTT (Thiazolyl Blue Tetrazolium Bromide) (Sigma-Aldrich) in DMEM for up to 20 min 37 °C/5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The medium was removed again, and formazan crystals were dissolved in 120 uL of isopropanol acidified with 5 mM hydrochloric acid (POCH, Gliwice, Poland). 90 uL of samples from each well were transferred to a new, transparent 96-well plate. The absorbance of samples was measured using Spectra Max Gemini EM (Molecular Devices) at 570 nm. Results were calculated as a percentage of lavender oil-treated cells compared to the untreated control (cells in DMEM medium).
