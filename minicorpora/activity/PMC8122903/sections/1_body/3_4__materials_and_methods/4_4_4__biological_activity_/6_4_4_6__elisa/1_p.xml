<p>Cytokine levels (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TGF-β1, VEGF, and TNFα) in the cell culture media were measured using commercial ELISA kits (R&amp;D) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In short, MaxiSorp 96-well plates (Thermo Scientific) were coated overnight with appropriate coating antibodies diluted in PBS. Next, the wells were washed with washing buffer (0.05% Tween in PBS) and blocked for 1 h RT with 200 µL of 1% BSA diluted in PBS. The wells were washed and 100 µL of samples were added to the wells and incubated for 2 h in RT. After a thorough wash, wells were incubated with the primary antibodies conjugated with biotin for 2 h and washed again. Then, the wells were incubated with HRP-conjugated streptavidin for 20 min. Prior to developing, the wells were washed five times, and 100 µL of TMB substrate solution (TMB Substrate Reagent Set, BD) was added per well. After the signal was developed sufficiently, the reaction was stopped with 50 µL 2N H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> (POCH). The absorbance was measured at 450 nm and 570 nm.
