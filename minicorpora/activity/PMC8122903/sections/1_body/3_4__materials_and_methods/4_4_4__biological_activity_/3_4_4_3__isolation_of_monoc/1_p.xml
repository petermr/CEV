<p>Whole blood donated by anonymous donors at the Regional Blood Donation and Haemotherapy Centre (Kraków, Poland) was centrifuged (400 g, 12 min, 20 °C). Plasma was collected, heat-inactivated (water bath, 30 min, 56 °C), centrifuged (3000 g, 15 min, 20 °C) and stored as autologous plasma for medium supplementation during cell culture. Meanwhile, blood morphotic elements were resuspended in PBS and applied on Percoll (density 1077 g/mL, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). After centrifugation (400 g, 35 min, RT) buffy coats (formed between the plasma and Percoll layers) were collected and suspended in RPMI 1640 medium (ThermoFisher) with 1% FBS. Cells were centrifuged (350 g, 12 min, 4 °C) and supernatant was discarded. Cells were resuspended in 6 mL of RPMI with 1% FBS, gently applied on 1.5 mL of FBS and centrifuged (280 g, 10 min, 4 °C). Finally, cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% autologous HI plasma and 50 μg/mL gentamicin (Thermo Scientific) and seeded at density of 3 mln cells/well on 24-well plates. After 24 h of culture, non-adherent cells were removed by PBS washes. Remaining adherent cells (approx. 300,000 cells/well) were cultivated in fresh medium (RPMI 1640 medium with 10% autologous HI plasma, gentamicin) and allowed to differentiate to monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs) for at least 7 days, with medium changed every 2 days.</p>
