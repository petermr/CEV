<p>RNA was isolated from TRIzol reagent lysates as specified by the manufacturer. Next, equal amounts of RNA were reverse transcribed using High Capacity Reverse Transcription Kit (ThermoFisher). cDNA was mixed with primer pairs (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02458-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) in the final concentration of 0.33 µM and the PowerUp SYBR Green MasterMix (ThermoFisher) reagent. Reactions were run in the following conditions: 5 min 95 °C; 40 cycles of: 30 s 95 °C, 30 s 58 °C, and 30 s 72 °C; final elongation step was followed with melting curve analysis for product evaluation. The fold change of gene expression was calculated using the ddCt method, compared to the EF2 expression.
