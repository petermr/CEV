<p>Identification analyses were carried out for 1% samples of the examined oils dissolved in dichloromethane. For quantitative analyses, 50 mg of the analyzed oils dissolved in 1 mL of dichloromethane were used, which was then diluted 20 times before injecting into the chromatograph. Calibration curves for each substance were performed using standard analysis in the concentration range of about 50–4000 µg/mL in dichloromethane. The ranges were modified depending on the concentrations of substances in the tested samples.</p>
