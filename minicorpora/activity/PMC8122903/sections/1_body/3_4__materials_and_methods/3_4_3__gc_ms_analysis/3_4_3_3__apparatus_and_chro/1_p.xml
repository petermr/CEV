<p>An Agilent Technology 6890N gas chromatograph with a 5973 MSD mass spectrometer was used. Capillary column INNOWax (60 m × 0.25 mm i.d., film thickness 0.5 μm) was installed in the gas chromatograph coupled into the ion source of the mass spectrometer (Agilent 5973 MSD). The column worked in programmed conditions from 50 °C (for 2 min), then temperature increased 5 °C/min to 80 °C (0 min), 10 °C/min to 120 °C (0 min), 20 °C/min to 240 °C, and the analysis temperature was maintained up to 30 min. The gas (helium) flow through the column was constant at 25 cm/s. The injector temperature was 250 °C, and the volume of injected sample was 1 µL in split mode (20:1) for identification and 50:1 for quantitative analysis. The mass spectrometer (Agilent 5973 MSD) worked in scan mode with electron ionization (EI) with 70 eV energy. The range of measured masses was 10–350
