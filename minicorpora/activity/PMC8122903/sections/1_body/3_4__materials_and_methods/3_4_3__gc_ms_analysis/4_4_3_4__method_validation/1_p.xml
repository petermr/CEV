<p>The specificity of the analytical method has been ensured by the use of a mass spectrometer and the comparison of the obtained mass spectra of individual substances with the NIST MS Search 2.0 standard library, and in the quantitative analysis, additionally using the high purity analytical standards of substances tested. The quantification method was validated for linearity and correlation coefficient, precision, limit of quantification (LOQ) and limit of detection (LOD).</p>
