<p>Lavandula genus is currently the subject of genetic engineering, as a result of which new variants of garden lavender are being created. The plant contains various biologically active substances which have therapeutic potential, but there is a lack of relevant information on the dosage of lavender preparations. Currently, further research is underway on the mechanisms of the effects of lavender and its metabolites and the safety of their use. The majority of research is focused on studying and comparing bacteriostatic and antioxidant properties of different lavender varieties [
