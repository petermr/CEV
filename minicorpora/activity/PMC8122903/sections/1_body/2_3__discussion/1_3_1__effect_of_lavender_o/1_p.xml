<p>The main components of lavender oil are linalyl acetate, linalool, ocimenes, lavandulol, and lavandulyl acetate. Interestingly, the proportions of each appear to be affecting one another, for example, the larger share of linalyl acetate was observed with the smaller content of ocimenes and vice versa [

The composition of the oils may change due to environmental factors, e.g., the origin of the plant, sunlight exposure, or plant age, as well as plant variety. In many previous works, the chemical composition and antibacterial and antifungal effects of lavender oil have been examined, but different varieties of the same species have not been directly compared.
