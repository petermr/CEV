<p>Kivrak et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] compared the chemical composition and antioxidant effect of six varieties of 
 <italic>L. angustifolia</italic>: “Sevtopolis”, “Yubileina”, “Druzhba”, “Raya”, “Hebar”, “Hemus”, and two varieties of lavandin L. × intermedia (a hybrid of narrow-leaved lavender with broad-leaved lavender): “Grey Hedge” and “Super A” from Turkey. The GC/MS analyses of the essential oils showed 66 components, including linalyl acetate (4.648–46.887%), linalool (28.102–36.801%), β-farnesene (0.914–7.053%), β-caryophyllene (0.637–6.290%), and lavandulyl acetate (0.831–4.840%) as the main components of both species of lavender. Interestingly, there was a significant difference in the content of the main components of the lavender oil (linalyl acetate and linalool) depending on the variety. Hemus variety of 
 <italic>L. angustifolia</italic> contained the highest amount of linalyl acetate content (46.887%), while the highest linalool content (36.801%) was found in lavandin L. × intermedia Super A variety. 
 <italic>L. angustifolia</italic> Sevtopolis variety had the highest content of lavandulyl acetate (4.840%) and β-caryophyllene (6.290%). The concentration of camphor in each 
 <italic>L. angustifolia</italic> variety was below 0.5%, and in L. × intermedia varieties it was over 5%. According to the ISO 3515:2002 standard [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], lavender essential oil contains linalool (25–38%), linalyl acetate (25–45%), and camphor (0.5–1.0%). Lavandin essential oil contains linalool (24–35%), linalyl acetate (28–38%), and camphor (6–8%) according to the ISO 8902:2009 [
