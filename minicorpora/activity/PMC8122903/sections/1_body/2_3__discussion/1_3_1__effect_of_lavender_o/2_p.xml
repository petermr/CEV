<p>The chemical composition of the essential oil depends largely on the variety of the narrow-leaved lavender. Adaszyńska et al. [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] analyzed the composition of the oils derived from flowers of different varieties of the narrow-leaved lavender (
 <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic> L.): “Munstead”, “Munstaed Strain”, “Blue River”, “Ellegance Purple”, and “Lavender Lady” cultivated in Szczecin, Poland. The studies showed that different varieties of narrow-leaved lavender differed in individual compounds: from a total of 55 compounds identified, the majority belonged to the group of monoterpenoids and their esters. Sesquiterpenoids were also identified. The authors of the study observed that different varieties of narrow-leaved lavender contained the same main compounds (linalool 15.9–23.9%, linalyl acetate 1.2–4.7%, cis-ocimene 1.1–2.4%, and lavandulol 3.4–4.6%), however, the compounds found in low concentrations were different, which could affect their biological properties.
