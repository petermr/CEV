<p>The oil from 
 <italic>L. angustifolia</italic> has the most variable composition. An example can be a comparison of the composition of the oil depending on the country of origin. In the case of the oil from Bulgaria, the content of ocimenes was in the range of 6.8–7.7%, linalool 30–34%, linalyl acetate 35–38%, and lavandulol and its acetate were not identified. The oil from China did not contain ocimenes and the main components were linalool (24–36%), linalyl acetate (29–36%), lavandulol and its acetate (1.6–1.7%). The oil from India also did not contain ocimenes and the main components were linalool (10%), linalyl acetate (45%), and lavandulol (0.1%) [

 <italic>L. angustifolia</italic>) from the varieties which grow in Poland includes in the largest quantities: linalool (15.9−33.8%), linalyl acetate (ca. 21.9%), geraniol (1.4−8.8%), bornyl acetate (ca. 6.1%), and trans-caryophyllene (ca. 6.1%). In smaller amounts, the oil also contained borneol, terpineol, limonene, α-, and β-pinenes. The camphor content was 0.7% [

 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] identified seventy-eight compounds in the essential oil obtained from the dried flowers of Lavandula angustifolia, cultivated in Poland. The major constituents of the oil were linalool (30.6%), linalyl acetate (14.2%), geraniol (5.3%), β-caryophyllene (4.7%), and lavandulyl acetate (4.4%).
