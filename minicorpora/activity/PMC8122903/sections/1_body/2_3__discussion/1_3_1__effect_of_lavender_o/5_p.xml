<p>The subject of our study was the comparison of the composition and proregenerative properties of the narrow-leaved lavender oil that was available on the market and manufactured in Provence, France, with the oil obtained from the narrow-leaved lavender cultivated in Poland, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship. The composition of the essential oil used for medicinal purposes is subject to the requirements set out in the European and Polish Pharmacopoeia [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In accordance with these sources, the main components of 
 <italic>L. angustifolia</italic> oil are linalool and its acetate. Both oils studied here met this requirement; however, the self-prepared oil contained less linalool (23.2 vs. 40.2%). This substance is listed in the Regulation (EC) no. 1223/2009 (OJ L 342/59) of the European Parliament and of the Council among the 26 substances causing sensitization. Other substances listed in this regulation and found in the tested oils were geraniol and d-limonene, but their content was very low (&lt;2%). The tested lavender oils had a similar qualitative composition, but they differed in their quantitative composition of individual substances. The obtained results are in line with literature reports [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, in the case of self-prepared oil, a much higher content of lavandulyl acetate was found in comparison with the commercial oil (23.2 vs. 5.5%). According to the Pharmacopoeia, its content is usually &gt;0.2%, and for both tested oils, these values were higher.
