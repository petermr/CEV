<p>The induction of IL-6 expression upon lavender oil stimulation shown in this manuscript may be interpreted as fundamental for promoting wound healing in epithelial tissue, and it is consistent with the previously observed reaction of keratinocyte cell lines [

 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Indeed, in vivo mice models identified IL-6 as indispensable in tissue regeneration. IL-6 knock-out BALB/c mice show prolonged wound healing due to decreased TGF-Î² and VEGF production in tissues [
