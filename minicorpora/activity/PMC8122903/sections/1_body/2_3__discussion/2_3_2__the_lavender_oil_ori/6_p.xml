<p>Finally, we have identified the potential of the lavender oil to increase the production of VEGF. Several studies indicate the importance of VEGF in wound healing, as the neutralizing antibodies, low molecular weight signal transduction blockers, or induced genetic deletions, reducing VEGF activity resulted in delayed wound healing [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In particular, the in vivo model of VEGF-deficient keratinocytes hampered the formation of new blood vessels and slower wound healing [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Interestingly, lowered VEGF levels and poor angiogenesis are observed in difficult to heal diabetic wounds [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and VEGF supplementation accelerates wound closure, granular tissue formation and improves the mechanical properties of the healed area [

 <xref rid="B40-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. VEGF has been shown to influence the proliferation and migration of keratinocytes, both in vitro [

 <xref rid="B42-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and in vivo [

 <xref rid="B44-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In addition, VEGF promotes keratinocyte survival in the UV irradiation model [

 <xref rid="B46-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. At the same time, VEGF promotes macrophage polarization and the proregenerative phenotype of M2 [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], while the reduced levels of VEGF correlate with the predominance of the proinflammatory phenotype of M1 and reduced phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils in diabetic wounds [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].
