 <xref rid="B32-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], serves as the main chemoattractant to neutrophils in wound exudative fluid, as demonstrated in mice models. Moreover, it possesses stimulating potential for keratinocyte proliferation in vitro and improves wound healing potential in an in vivo model. IL-8 was also found to promote vascularization, supplementing reduced levels of typical proangiogenic factors in non-healing wounds [
