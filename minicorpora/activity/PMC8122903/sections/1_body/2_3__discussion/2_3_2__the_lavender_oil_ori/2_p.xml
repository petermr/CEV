<p>The in vitro studies focused on the analysis of the responses of epithelial cells (HaCaT human keratinocyte line) and monocyte-derived macrophages. Results showed a concentration-dependent effect of lavender oils on IL-6, IL-8, and VEGF production by keratinocytes markedly increased during co-stimulation of cells with the model PAMP molecule—bacterial LPS. Importantly, the levels of those cytokines were significantly higher in cells co-treated with in-house produced oil. Interleukin-6 is the central cytokine of the wound healing reaction. It is responsible for the regulation of the inflammatory phase and further transition to a proliferative state. It is produced in the early stages in response to tissue damage and induces auto- and paracrine inflammatory reaction in keratinocytes, macrophages and fibroblasts. Later in the proliferative stage, the presence of IL-6 is responsible for the change in macrophage polarization from proinflammatory (M1) to proregenerative (M2) phenotype, migration and proliferation of keratinocytes, the increase in VEGF production and induction of TGF-β production by fibroblasts. Finally, decreasing amounts of IL-6 are indicative of the late remodeling stage of wound healing [
