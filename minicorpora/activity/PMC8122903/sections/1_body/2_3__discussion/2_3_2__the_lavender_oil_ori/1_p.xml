<p>The wound healing process consists of four overlapping phasesâ€”hemostasis, inflammatory, proliferative, and remodeling; their proper regulation is required for fast recovery and minimalization of scar formation. A critical step in the inflammatory phase is the mobilization of immune cells due to the release of DAMPs molecules (danger-associated molecular patterns) from the damaged area and the presence of PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) in the case of the typically nonsterile wounds. These factors stimulate the production of signaling molecules (IL-6, IL-8, and VEGF) by epithelial cells [

At first, neutrophils infiltrate the area, followed by monocytes, which differentiate into macrophages and begin to perform regulatory functions. Other cell types, including platelets and fibroblasts, take part in extinguishing the inflammatory phase and regulate the course of the proliferative phase.
