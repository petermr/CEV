<p>As mentioned above, IL-6 induces the production of TGF-β in fibroblasts—a step crucial to their regenerative proliferation, differentiation to myofibroblasts and formation of the granular tissue. In accordance, in vivo rat model examining the effect of the lavender oil on the healing of burn wounds indicated an enhanced TGF-β production, accompanied by the higher rate of fibroblast proliferation, increased production of collagen and faster wound healing [
