<p>The presence of lavender oil preparations did not affect macrophage functions without bacterial LPS co-stimulation. In the presence of the endotoxin, however, the expected proinflammatory response was hampered by lavender oil. As expected, both the expression of the TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8 genes, and the levels of cytokines released into the medium were increased by LPS alone. Our in-house preparation of lavender oil alleviated LPS-induced inflammatory response, causing about 50% reduction in the expression of TNF-α and IL-6 genes and was superior in the reduction of IL-6 when compared to the commercial lavender oil. Since hMDMs, as opposed to HaCaT cells, are considered to be specialized immune response cells, any reduction in their proimmune response would strongly limit the excessive activation of all the immune cells and, therefore, facilitate the return to homeostasis. This, in turn, will be beneficial during the proliferative phase of wound healing, resulting in a quicker and complication-free wound closure.</p>
