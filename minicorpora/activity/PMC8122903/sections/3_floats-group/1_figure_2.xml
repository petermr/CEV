  <p>Cytotoxicity of tested lavender oils. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Cell viability assay (MTT) was performed after 24 h incubation of HaCaT cells with designated concentrations (
   <italic>v</italic>/
   <italic>v</italic>) of commercial or in-house preparation of lavender oil. Values are mean ± SD. Groups were compared to the control, and statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism and build-in ANOVA test. 
   <italic>p</italic>-values ≤ 0.05 were considered significant. ***—
   <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001; ****—
   <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.0001. (
   <bold>B</bold>) IC50% values were interpolated as lavender oil concentration required for the 50% reduction in cell viability. The data represent mean ± SD between four replicates. Statistical significance was evaluated using a 
   <italic>t</italic>-test. ***—
   <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001.
