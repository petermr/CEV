  <p>Effect of lavender oil stimulation on the cytokines production in HaCaT cell line. HaCaT cells were stimulated with designated concentrations (
   <italic>v</italic>/
   <italic>v</italic>) of commercial or in-house preparation of lavender oil for 24 h. Level of cytokine in cell media: IL-6, IL-8, TGF-β, VEGFA were verified with ELISA. Values are mean with range. Groups were compared to the control, and statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism and build-in ANOVA test. 
   <italic>p</italic>-values ≤ 0.05 were considered significant. *—
