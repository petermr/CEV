  <p>Effect of co-stimulation with lavender oil and bacterial LPS on the cytokines production in human macrophages. hMDM cells were stimulated with 0.05% commercial or in-house preparation of lavender oil and 100 ng/mL of 
   <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> LPS for 24 h. Level of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, TGF-β in cell media were verified with ELISA. Values are mean ± SD. Groups were compared to the control, and statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism and build-in ANOVA test. Individual comparisons between groups are indicated by the gates. 
   <italic>p</italic>-values ≤ 0.05 were considered significant. ****—
