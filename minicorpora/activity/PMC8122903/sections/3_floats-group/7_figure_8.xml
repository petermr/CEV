  <p>Effect of co-stimulation with lavender oil and bacterial LPS on the cytokines production in HaCaT cell line. HaCaT cells were stimulated with 0.01% of commercial or in-house preparation of lavender oil and 5 ug/mL of 
   <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> LPS for 24 h. Level of cytokine in cell media: IL-6, IL-8, TGF-β, and VEGFA were verified with ELISA. Values are mean ± SD. Groups were compared to the control, and statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism and build-in ANOVA test. Individual comparisons between groups are indicated by the gates. 
   <italic>p</italic>-values ≤ 0.05 were considered significant. *—
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.05–0.011; **—
   <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.01; ****—
   <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.0001.
