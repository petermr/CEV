  <p>Effect of lavender oil stimulation on the expression level of cytokines in HaCaT cell line. HaCaT cells were stimulated with designated concentrations (
   <italic>v</italic>/
   <italic>v</italic>) of commercial or in-house preparation of lavender oil for 4 h. Levels of mRNA production of cytokines: IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, EGF, TGF-β, and VEGFA were verified with RT-PCR. Values are mean with range. Groups were compared to the control, and statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism and build-in ANOVA test. 
   <italic>p</italic>-values ≤ 0.05 were considered significant. *—
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.05–0.011; **—
   <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.01; ***—
   <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001; ****—
   <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.0001.
