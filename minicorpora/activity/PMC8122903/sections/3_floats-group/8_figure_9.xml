  <p>Effect of co-stimulation with lavender oil and bacterial LPS on the expression level of cytokines in human macrophages. hMDM cells were stimulated with 0.05% commercial or in-house preparation of lavender oil and 100 ng/mL of 
   <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> LPS for 4 h. Level of mRNA production of cytokines: IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TGF-β, TNF-α, and VEGFA were verified with RT-PCR. Values are mean with range. Groups were compared to the control, and statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism and build-in ANOVA test. Individual comparisons between groups are indicated by the gates. 
   <italic>p</italic>-values ≤ 0.05 were considered significant. *—
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.05–0.011; **—
   <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.01; ***—
   <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001; ****—
   <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.0001.
