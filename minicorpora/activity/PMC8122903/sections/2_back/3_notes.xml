 <title>Institutional Review Board Statement</title>
 <p>Human blood from healthy donors for HMDM isolation was obtained from Red Cross, Krakow, Poland. The Red Cross de-identified blood materi-als as appropriate for the confidentiality assurance of human subjects. Donors provid-ed written informed consent for the collection of samples and subsequent cell isolation and analysis. Thus, this study adheres to appropriate exclusions from the approval of human subjects, according to current regulations.</p>
