However, the mechanism of action of the lavender oil depends on its composition, which in turn is dependent on the origin and growing conditions. Our study aimed to compare the composition and proregenerative properties of the commercially-available narrow-leaved lavender oil produced in Provence, France, with the oil obtained from the narrow-leaved lavender cultivated locally in Poland. GC/MS analysis showed that self-manufactured essential oil had lower linalool content than commercial oil (23.2 vs. 40.2%), comparable linalyl acetate content (40.6 vs. 44%), while the proportion of lavandulyl acetate was significantly higher (23.2 vs. 5.5%). To determine the influence of lavender oil on the production of proinflammatory cytokines and proregenerative growth factors, gene expression of the selected signaling molecules by HaCaT cells was investigated using real-time PCR. Results showed a concentration-dependent effect of lavender oils on the production of IL-6, IL-8, and VEGF by the keratinocyte cell line. Finally, the potential of the lavender oil to increase the production of VEGF, the most important angiogenic factor, with the in-house preparation performing significantly better in the in vitro cell models was identified.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic> essential oil</kwd><kwd>GC/MS analysis</kwd><kwd>wound healing</kwd><kwd>proinflammatory cytokines</kwd><kwd>proregenerative growth factors</kwd><kwd>HaCaT</kwd><kwd>VEGF</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-molecules-26-02458"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Lavender is one of the most popular plants in the world and originates from the mountain areas of the Mediterranean. The Lavandula genus belongs to the <italic>Lamiaceae</italic> family and includes over 30 species, out of which the most commonly cultivated are: <italic>L. angustifolia Mill</italic>. (narrow-leaved lavender), <italic>L. stoechas</italic> (French lavender) oraz <italic>L. latifolia</italic> (broad-leaved lavender). Its generic name comes from the verb lavare, which means &#x0201c;to wash&#x0201d; in Latin [<xref rid="B1-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Out of all Lavandula genera, the most valuable genus in terms of unique biological activity is narrow-leaved lavender (<italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic>, formerly <italic>L. officinalis Chaix</italic> or <italic>L. vera</italic>), also known as garden lavender [<xref rid="B2-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Lavender oil is distilled from the flowers and the top growth of narrow-leaved lavender [<xref rid="B4-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The medicinal raw material comes mainly from the flowers, with the essential oil obtained ca. 3%. The essential oils from the Lavandula genus contain similar components but in different proportions. The quality and composition of the essential oil depend on the origin, growing conditions, variety, and other factors. Lavender oil can contain more than 100 different components. Mainly, these are terpenoid compounds (monoterpenes, triterpenes, sesquiterpenes) as well as phenolic compounds (flavonoids, phenolic acids, coumarin, tannins). The main components of the essential oil should be linalool (20&#x02013;45%) and its acetate (25&#x02013;46%). The percentage of other ingredients falls usually within the following ranges: limonene (&#x0003c;1.0%), eucalyptol (&#x0003c;2.5%), camphor (&#x0003c;1.2%), terpinen-4-ol (0.1&#x02013;6.0%), lavandulol (&#x0003e;0.1%), lavandulyl acetate (&#x0003e;0.2%), and &#x003b1;-terpineol (&#x0003c;2.0) [<xref rid="B2-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B5-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Lavender oil is characterized by a variety of pharmacological activities ranging from anti-inflammatory to antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, antiseptic, antiviral, antidepressive, sedative, immune-stimulating, and even anticancer effects [<xref rid="B1-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B7-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It has a strong bactericidal effect on many strains of bacteria (e.g., <italic>Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis</italic>), accompanied by a weak fungicidal activity (e.g., <italic>Botrytis cinereal</italic>, <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>). Formulations containing lavender oil are used to treat inflammation in the mouth and throat and upper respiratory tract infections. In dermatology, the essential oil preparations help to relieve skin inflammation, psoriasis, or eczema [<xref rid="B1-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Moreover, the oil is a component of ointments used to treat wounds and burns. According to the literature, pure lavender oil was used to treat wounds after burns during World War I [<xref rid="B1-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Due to its antimicrobial properties, it causes the purulent states of the skin to subside and it improves the healing rate of the wounds. It should be noted, however, that the direct contact of essential oils with the skin can lead to irritation and allergic reactions [<xref rid="B8-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In aromatherapy, lavender oil acts as a remedy with a potential sedative, sleeping, anxiolytic, and mood-enhancing effect [<xref rid="B4-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In the cosmetic industry, it is used to produce bath salts, shampoos, skin tonic, cosmetic face masks, and for aromatizing naturally manufactured creams, balsam, or toilet waters [<xref rid="B9-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The essential oil may also be used to preserve cosmetic products as an effective alternative for synthetic preservatives such as DMDM hydantoin, which acts as formaldehyde releaser [<xref rid="B10-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Lavandula genus is currently the subject of genetic engineering, as a result of which new variants of garden lavender are being created. The plant contains various biologically active substances which have therapeutic potential, but there is a lack of relevant information on the dosage of lavender preparations. Currently, further research is underway on the mechanisms of the effects of lavender and its metabolites and the safety of their use. The majority of research is focused on studying and comparing bacteriostatic and antioxidant properties of different lavender varieties [<xref rid="B3-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B11-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of self-manufactured and commercially available lavender oil on the proinflammatory and proregenerative effect of human keratinocytes in the HaCaT model.

Lavender Oil Cytotoxicity</title><p>The maximum concentration of lavender oil was optimized in the preliminary experiments, where up to 25% concentration was investigated. For the present study on full lavender oil, we observed complete cytotoxicity at 1.5% concentration, and these conditions were chosen for further evaluation and IC50% determination, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02458-f002">Figure 2</xref>. Serial dilutions were prepared in the cell culture medium from 25% of each preparation to 0.025% and were incubated with HaCaT cells for 24 h. The cell viability was then estimated by formazan crystal deposition and absorbance measurement at 570 nm. The results of the control cells incubated in the culture medium alone were used for the comparison and represented 100% cell viability. The general cytotoxicity of the oils was high, and already 0.4% LO-C caused a reduction of cell viability to 10% of the control sample, compared to the moderate reduction (36% of the control cell viability) for the same concentration of commercial preparation LO-SM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02458-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The 0.1% concentration was identified as safe for all tested preparations and was employed as the high concentration limit in all subsequent cell-based experiments.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-molecules-26-02458"><title>2.3. Effect of Lavender Oil Preparations on the Cytokine Cellular Response</title><p>To determine the influence of lavender oil on the production of proinflammatory cytokines and proregenerative growth factors, gene expression of the selected signaling molecules by HaCaT cells was investigated using real-time PCR. Cells were stimulated with lavender oil (LO-SM and LO-C; 0.1%) for 4 or 24 h, then RNA was isolated, cDNA was transcribed and used as template in RT-PCR. The results revealed significant induction of IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-8, and VEGF gene expression upon stimulation with lavender oil. IL-8 expression was enhanced nearly 4-fold. Both LO-SM and LO-C induced a 2-fold increase in IL-6, VEGF, and IL-1&#x003b2; gene expression. At the same time, EGF and TGF-&#x003b2;1 expression was not affected by the presence of the lavender oils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02458-f003">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate the changes in the HaCaT cytokine secretion to the culture medium, ELISA was performed 24-h post-stimulation. IL-8 levels were increased 50% to the level of 30 pg/mL for LO-SM at 0.1% concentration. A similar trend was observed for LO-C, however, the significance level was not achieved in the statistical analysis when compared to the control cells. This effect was accompanied by the significant increase in VEGF levels observed in medium, which reached 500 pg/mL in cell media treated with 0.1% full oil preparations, observed for both LO-SM and LO-C. The levels of IL-6 or TGF-&#x003b2; were unaffected upon stimulation with any preparation of lavender oil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02458-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Similarly, no significant increase in IL-1&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2; concentration in cell culture medium was observed (data not shown). The measured medium concentrations of IL-1&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2; were generally low, indicating the low potential of lavender oil for the proinflammatory stimulation of HaCaT cells.</p><p>In agreement with this observation, only a limited effect on the cytokine production by human macrophages was observed. hMDMs were stimulated with lavender oil preparations, similarly as described for HaCaT cells, and gene expression of proinflammatory M1-phenotype-related TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-8, IL-6, and proregenerative M2 phenotype-related IL-10 was measured by real-time PCR. Gene expression levels of IL-6 and IL-8 were increased only by LO-C; 7-fold and 2-fold, respectively, when compared to the control. Some induction of TNF-&#x003b1; was observed at the 0.025% LO-SM, yet it was reduced to the control levels at higher concentrations of LO-SM. A weak induction of VEGF-A gene was noticeable, but again, the levels did not reach 2-fold induction. Interestingly, IL-10 expression was reduced ~2-fold, indicating that macrophages remained in M1 phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02458-f005">Figure 5</xref>). At the same time, ELISA tests of the cytokine levels in the cell media did not reveal any increase in IL-8 and TGF-&#x003b2; secretion, regardless of timepoint and lavender oil concentration used, indicating the lack of the direct effect of lavender oil preparations on the resting macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02458-f006">Figure 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-molecules-26-02458"><title>2.4. Effect of the Lavender Oil on LPS Stimulated HaCaT Keratinocytes</title><p>To investigate the effect of the lavender oil preparations on the inflammatory-stimulated epithelial and immune cells, we employed the model based on the stimulated HaCaT and macrophage cells. TLR4-interacting ligand, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> LPS, was used to activate cells prior to the lavender oil application. Co-stimulation of HaCaT cells with LPS and lavender oil resulted in the strong induction of the VEGF-A gene. Both preparations, LO-SM and LO-C, induced VEGF-A expression 3-fold, yet strikingly the presence of LPS exaggerated the effect further, allowing for the 15x (LO-SM) and 23x (LO-C) VEGF-A stimulation. Similarly, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, and IL-8 were synergistically upregulated by co-stimulation with LPS and lavender oil. In contrast, the expression of TGF-&#x003b2; was not affected at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02458-f007">Figure 7</xref>). At the same time, LPS alone did not affect the expression of VEGF nor TGF-&#x003b2; by HaCaT cells.</p><p>ELISA measurement of the cell medium secreted IL-6 and IL-8 confirmed the synergy between LPS and lavender oil stimulation. Although LO-SM and LO-C stimulated IL-6 and IL-8 production by HaCaT cells, in accordance with the effect observed at the RNA level, in the presence of LPS the effect was strongly enhanced. LO-SM stimulated the release of IL-6 nearly 400-fold, while commercial preparation induced 100&#x000d7; higher concentrations of IL-6 in the medium when compared to the control, reaching nearly 400 pg/mL and 100 pg/mL, respectively. Additionally, IL-8 secretion was synergistically enhanced. When incubated together with LPS, LO-SM and LO-C boosted the IL-8 production by the stimulated cells to 600 (LO-SM) or 300 pg/mL (LO-C), compared to the 40 (LO-SM) and 30 pg/mL (LO-C) induced by the lavender oil alone. Again, LPS alone did not stimulate secretion (IL-6) or induced only a moderate production (50 pg/mL IL-8) of the investigated cytokines by the HaCaT cells. Moreover, the proregenerative response of HaCaT cells was affected as well. Co-stimulation with LPS and lavender oil increased VEGF concentration in the culture medium to 1200 and 1000 pg/mL for LO-SM and LO-C, respectively. This effect, however, was additive rather than synergic, as both LPS and lavender oil alone stimulated VEGF secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02458-f008">Figure 8</xref>). Collectively, this indicates that lavender oil strongly augments the wound healing response in the activated HaCaT cells, enhancing the effect of the LPS-induced TLR stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-molecules-26-02458"><title>2.5. Effects of Lavender Oil on LPS-Prestimulated hMDMs</title><p>Interestingly, the co-stimulation of the cells with the lavender oil and LPS significantly limited the macrophage proinflammatory response. It resulted in a 2500-fold increase in TNF-&#x003b1; (vs. 3500-fold increase during stimulation with LPS alone) and 3000-fold increase in IL-6 expression (vs. 7000-fold increase during stimulation with LPS alone). At the same time, expression of IL-8 by cells stimulated with LPS and lavender oil was additive, reaching 110-fold increase, compared to 80-fold for LPS alone. Both LO-SM and LO-C comparably hindered the proinflammatory gene expression. In parallel, the additive effect on IL-10 production was observed. LPS alone limited IL-10 gene expression by a 30%, while the co-stimulation with either LO-SM or LO-C reduced the IL-10 expression by 50% when compared to the untreated cells. Interestingly, although the LPS-alone lowered the expression of TGF-&#x003b2;, the cells seemed to be protected from the LPS-induced TGF-&#x003b2; production decrease during co-stimulation with lavender oils, retaining levels closer to the control sample, thus displaying a clear anti-inflammatory effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02458-f009">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of the cytokine secretion to the cell medium revealed similar trends as observed on the RNA level. LPS induced the IL-6 secretion to 800 pg/mL. However, the limiting effect of lavender oil was observed only with the in-house formulation LO-SM, which resulted in concentrations below 500 pg/mL. TNF-&#x003b1; levels were increased by the LPS stimulation to 1600 pg/mL, while both LO-SM and LO-C lowered the observed TNF-&#x003b1; release to 1000 pg/mL, again indicating the inflammation-limiting effect of lavender oil on human macrophages. At the same time, co-stimulation of IL-8 production by LPS and lavender oil was confirmed, as the LPS co-stimulation with either LO-SM or LO-C resulted in 4000 pg/mL of IL-8 secreted to the medium, compared to 2500 pg/mL for LPS-only. Lavender oil alone nor with LPS pretreatment did not stimulate TGF-&#x003b2; release from macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02458-f010">Figure 10</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3-molecules-26-02458"><title>3.

The studies showed that different varieties of narrow-leaved lavender differed in individual compounds: from a total of 55 compounds identified, the majority belonged to the group of monoterpenoids and their esters. Sesquiterpenoids were also identified. The authors of the study observed that different varieties of narrow-leaved lavender contained the same main compounds (linalool 15.9&#x02013;23.9%, linalyl acetate 1.2&#x02013;4.7%, cis-ocimene 1.1&#x02013;2.4%, and lavandulol 3.4&#x02013;4.6%), however, the compounds found in low concentrations were different, which could affect their biological properties.</p><p>Kivrak et al.

The GC/MS analyses of the essential oils showed 66 components, including linalyl acetate (4.648&#x02013;46.887%), linalool (28.102&#x02013;36.801%), &#x003b2;-farnesene (0.914&#x02013;7.053%), &#x003b2;-caryophyllene (0.637&#x02013;6.290%), and lavandulyl acetate (0.831&#x02013;4.840%) as the main components of both species of lavender. Interestingly, there was a significant difference in the content of the main components of the lavender oil (linalyl acetate and linalool) depending on the variety. Hemus variety of <italic>L. angustifolia</italic> contained the highest amount of linalyl acetate content (46.887%), while the highest linalool content (36.801%) was found in lavandin L. &#x000d7; intermedia Super A variety. <italic>L. angustifolia</italic> Sevtopolis variety had the highest content of lavandulyl acetate (4.840%) and &#x003b2;-caryophyllene (6.290%). The concentration of camphor in each <italic>L. angustifolia</italic> variety was below 0.5%, and in L. &#x000d7; intermedia varieties it was over 5%. According to the ISO 3515:2002 standard [<xref rid="B5-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], lavender essential oil contains linalool (25&#x02013;38%), linalyl acetate (25&#x02013;45%), and camphor (0.5&#x02013;1.0%). Lavandin essential oil contains linalool (24&#x02013;35%), linalyl acetate (28&#x02013;38%), and camphor (6&#x02013;8%) according to the ISO 8902:2009 [<xref rid="B18-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>The oil from <italic>L. angustifolia</italic> has the most variable composition. An example can be a comparison of the composition of the oil depending on the country of origin. In the case of the oil from Bulgaria, the content of ocimenes was in the range of 6.8&#x02013;7.7%, linalool 30&#x02013;34%, linalyl acetate 35&#x02013;38%, and lavandulol and its acetate were not identified. The oil from China did not contain ocimenes and the main components were linalool (24&#x02013;36%), linalyl acetate (29&#x02013;36%), lavandulol and its acetate (1.6&#x02013;1.7%). The oil from India also did not contain ocimenes and the main components were linalool (10%), linalyl acetate (45%), and lavandulol (0.1%) [<xref rid="B19-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The oil derived from narrow-leaved lavender (<italic>L. angustifolia</italic>) from the varieties which grow in Poland includes in the largest quantities: linalool (15.9&#x02212;33.8%), linalyl acetate (ca. 21.9%), geraniol (1.4&#x02212;8.8%), bornyl acetate (ca. 6.1%), and trans-caryophyllene (ca. 6.1%). In smaller amounts, the oil also contained borneol, terpineol, limonene, &#x003b1;-, and &#x003b2;-pinenes. The camphor content was 0.7% [<xref rid="B6-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. &#x0015a;migielski et al.

The major constituents of the oil were linalool (30.6%), linalyl acetate (14.2%), geraniol (5.3%), &#x003b2;-caryophyllene (4.7%), and lavandulyl acetate (4.4%).</p><p>The subject of our study was the comparison of the composition and proregenerative properties of the narrow-leaved lavender oil that was available on the market and manufactured in Provence, France, with the oil obtained from the narrow-leaved lavender cultivated in Poland, &#x0015a;wi&#x00119;tokrzyskie Voivodeship. The composition of the essential oil used for medicinal purposes is subject to the requirements set out in the European and Polish Pharmacopoeia [<xref rid="B2-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B22-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In accordance with these sources, the main components of <italic>L. angustifolia</italic> oil are linalool and its acetate. Both oils studied here met this requirement; however, the self-prepared oil contained less linalool (23.2 vs. 40.2%). This substance is listed in the Regulation (EC) no. 1223/2009 (OJ L 342/59) of the European Parliament and of the Council among the 26 substances causing sensitization. Other substances listed in this regulation and found in the tested oils were geraniol and d-limonene, but their content was very low (&#x0003c;2%). The tested lavender oils had a similar qualitative composition, but they differed in their quantitative composition of individual substances. The obtained results are in line with literature reports [<xref rid="B3-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B6-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, in the case of self-prepared oil, a much higher content of lavandulyl acetate was found in comparison with the commercial oil (23.2 vs. 5.5%). According to the Pharmacopoeia, its content is usually &#x0003e;0.2%, and for both tested oils, these values were higher.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-molecules-26-02458"><title>3.2. The Lavender Oil Origin and the Proinflammatory and Proregenerative Cytokine Cellular Response</title><p>The wound healing process consists of four overlapping phases&#x02014;hemostasis, inflammatory, proliferative, and remodeling; their proper regulation is required for fast recovery and minimalization of scar formation. A critical step in the inflammatory phase is the mobilization of immune cells due to the release of DAMPs molecules (danger-associated molecular patterns) from the damaged area and the presence of PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) in the case of the typically nonsterile wounds. These factors stimulate the production of signaling molecules (IL-6, IL-8, and VEGF) by epithelial cells [<xref rid="B23-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. At first, neutrophils infiltrate the area, followed by monocytes, which differentiate into macrophages and begin to perform regulatory functions. Other cell types, including platelets and fibroblasts, take part in extinguishing the inflammatory phase and regulate the course of the proliferative phase.</p><p>The in vitro studies focused on the analysis of the responses of epithelial cells (HaCaT human keratinocyte line) and monocyte-derived macrophages. Results showed a concentration-dependent effect of lavender oils on IL-6, IL-8, and VEGF production by keratinocytes markedly increased during co-stimulation of cells with the model PAMP molecule&#x02014;bacterial LPS. Importantly, the levels of those cytokines were significantly higher in cells co-treated with in-house produced oil. Interleukin-6 is the central cytokine of the wound healing reaction. It is responsible for the regulation of the inflammatory phase and further transition to a proliferative state. It is produced in the early stages in response to tissue damage and induces auto- and paracrine inflammatory reaction in keratinocytes, macrophages and fibroblasts. Later in the proliferative stage, the presence of IL-6 is responsible for the change in macrophage polarization from proinflammatory (M1) to proregenerative (M2) phenotype, migration and proliferation of keratinocytes, the increase in VEGF production and induction of TGF-&#x003b2; production by fibroblasts. Finally, decreasing amounts of IL-6 are indicative of the late remodeling stage of wound healing [<xref rid="B24-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>The induction of IL-6 expression upon lavender oil stimulation shown in this manuscript may be interpreted as fundamental for promoting wound healing in epithelial tissue, and it is consistent with the previously observed reaction of keratinocyte cell lines [<xref rid="B25-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Indeed, in vivo mice models identified IL-6 as indispensable in tissue regeneration. IL-6 knock-out BALB/c mice show prolonged wound healing due to decreased TGF-&#x003b2; and VEGF production in tissues [<xref rid="B27-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], while the supplementation with recombinant IL-6 restored homeostatic wound healing responses [<xref rid="B28-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Moreover, reports indicate insufficient production of IL-6 in diabetic and persistent human wounds [<xref rid="B27-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>As mentioned above, IL-6 induces the production of TGF-&#x003b2; in fibroblasts&#x02014;a step crucial to their regenerative proliferation, differentiation to myofibroblasts and formation of the granular tissue. In accordance, in vivo rat model examining the effect of the lavender oil on the healing of burn wounds indicated an enhanced TGF-&#x003b2; production, accompanied by the higher rate of fibroblast proliferation, increased production of collagen and faster wound healing [<xref rid="B29-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>IL-8, an effector molecule of IL-6 [<xref rid="B30-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], serves as the main chemoattractant to neutrophils in wound exudative fluid, as demonstrated in mice models. Moreover, it possesses stimulating potential for keratinocyte proliferation in vitro and improves wound healing potential in an in vivo model. IL-8 was also found to promote vascularization, supplementing reduced levels of typical proangiogenic factors in non-healing wounds [<xref rid="B33-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Although some reports indicate prolonged chemoattractant activity of IL-8 as promotor of the excessive ECM degradation via increased neutrophil influx [<xref rid="B34-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], others shown, that the levels of IL-8 increased with the progress of wound healing and exerted a positive, proangiogenic effect, not related to activation of neutrophils at later stages of healing [<xref rid="B35-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Interestingly, heightened production of the IL-8 was also observed in our study, most notably during co-stimulation of cells with LPS.</p><p>Finally, we have identified the potential of the lavender oil to increase the production of VEGF. Several studies indicate the importance of VEGF in wound healing, as the neutralizing antibodies, low molecular weight signal transduction blockers, or induced genetic deletions, reducing VEGF activity resulted in delayed wound healing [<xref rid="B36-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In particular, the in vivo model of VEGF-deficient keratinocytes hampered the formation of new blood vessels and slower wound healing [<xref rid="B37-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Interestingly, lowered VEGF levels and poor angiogenesis are observed in difficult to heal diabetic wounds [<xref rid="B38-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and VEGF supplementation accelerates wound closure, granular tissue formation and improves the mechanical properties of the healed area [<xref rid="B39-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. VEGF has been shown to influence the proliferation and migration of keratinocytes, both in vitro [<xref rid="B41-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and in vivo [<xref rid="B43-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In addition, VEGF promotes keratinocyte survival in the UV irradiation model [<xref rid="B45-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. At the same time, VEGF promotes macrophage polarization and the proregenerative phenotype of M2 [<xref rid="B47-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], while the reduced levels of VEGF correlate with the predominance of the proinflammatory phenotype of M1 and reduced phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils in diabetic wounds [<xref rid="B48-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49-molecules-26-02458" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p><p>The presence of lavender oil preparations did not affect macrophage functions without bacterial LPS co-stimulation. In the presence of the endotoxin, however, the expected proinflammatory response was hampered by lavender oil. As expected, both the expression of the TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, and IL-8 genes, and the levels of cytokines released into the medium were increased by LPS alone. Our in-house preparation of lavender oil alleviated LPS-induced inflammatory response, causing about 50% reduction in the expression of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 genes and was superior in the reduction of IL-6 when compared to the commercial lavender oil. Since hMDMs, as opposed to HaCaT cells, are considered to be specialized immune response cells, any reduction in their proimmune response would strongly limit the excessive activation of all the immune cells and, therefore, facilitate the return to homeostasis. This, in turn, will be beneficial during the proliferative phase of wound healing, resulting in a quicker and complication-free wound closure.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4-molecules-26-02458"><title>4.

Effect of Lavender Oils on Eukaryotic Cells (HaCaT and hMDM)</title><p>Confluent cultures of HaCaT cells and fully differentiated hMDM cells (200 or 300 thousand cells respectively per well of a 24 well plate) were stimulated with different concentrations of lavender oil. In an alternative setup, cells were prepared in the same manner, but co-stimulated with <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> serotype O111:B4 LPS (SigmaAldrich) (concentration for HaCaT: 5 &#x000b5;g/mL, concentration for hMDM: 100 ng/mL) diluted in culture medium without supplements before the addition of the lavender oil preparations. After 4 and 24 h, cell media were collected, cells were washed with PBS and lysed with TRIzol reagent (ThermoFisher).</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot4dot5-molecules-26-02458"><title>4.4.5. RNA Isolation, Reverse Transcription, and Quantitative Real-Time PCR</title><p>RNA was isolated from TRIzol reagent lysates as specified by the manufacturer. Next, equal amounts of RNA were reverse transcribed using High Capacity Reverse Transcription Kit (ThermoFisher). cDNA was mixed with primer pairs (<xref rid="molecules-26-02458-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) in the final concentration of 0.33 &#x000b5;M and the PowerUp SYBR Green MasterMix (ThermoFisher) reagent.

The fold change of gene expression was calculated using the ddCt method, compared to the EF2 expression.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot4dot6-molecules-26-02458"><title>4.4.6. ELISA</title><p>Cytokine levels (IL-1&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-8, TGF-&#x003b2;1, VEGF, and TNF&#x003b1;) in the cell culture media were measured using commercial ELISA kits (R&#x00026;D) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. In short, MaxiSorp 96-well plates (Thermo Scientific) were coated overnight with appropriate coating antibodies diluted in PBS. Next, the wells were washed with washing buffer (0.05% Tween in PBS) and blocked for 1 h RT with 200 &#x000b5;L of 1% BSA diluted in PBS. The wells were washed and 100 &#x000b5;L of samples were added to the wells and incubated for 2 h in RT. After a thorough wash, wells were incubated with the primary antibodies conjugated with biotin for 2 h and washed again. Then, the wells were incubated with HRP-conjugated streptavidin for 20 min. Prior to developing, the wells were washed five times, and 100 &#x000b5;L of TMB substrate solution (TMB Substrate Reagent Set, BD) was added per well. After the signal was developed sufficiently, the reaction was stopped with 50 &#x000b5;L 2N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (POCH). The absorbance was measured at 450 nm and 570 nm.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-molecules-26-02458"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Previous reports showed the wound healing potential of <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic> essential oil. Herein we postulate that the lavender oil mechanism of action and effectiveness depend on its composition and, therefore, origin and growth conditions of the plant.</p><p>The presented in vitro studies focused on the analysis of the responses of epithelial cells (HaCaT human keratinocyte line) and human monocyte-derived macrophages. Results showed the concentration-dependent induction of production of IL-6 and IL-8 by keratinocytes markedly increased during co-stimulation of cells with the bacterial LPS. Inflammatory reaction was fine-tuned, as TNF-&#x003b1; production in hMDM was limited in the presence of lavender oil in the LPS-stimulated macrophages. Additionally, the proregenerative response of HaCaT cells potentiated by the VEGF cytokine was induced as well.</p><p>Reported results indicate lavender oil has a strong potential to enhance the local, tissue-derived proinflammatory and proregenerative response, while simultaneously limiting the inflammatory stimulation of the immune system cells, with in-house preparation performing significantly better in the in vitro cell models. This effect may be attributed to the increased concentration of lavandulyl acetate and decreased linalool acetate in the in-house preparation. Further studies are required to delineate the role of the VEGF stimulation and inflammatory modulation in the lavender oil-supported wound healing and to validate the importance of the individual lavender oil components.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceptualization, M.M., T.K. and E.B.; investigation, E.B., M.K.
