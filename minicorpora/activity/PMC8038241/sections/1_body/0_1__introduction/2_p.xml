<p>The replacement of animals by in vitro and ex vivo methodologies efficiently promotes one of the R’s, avoiding the use of animals in assays, with the ability to clarify the toxic potential or the effectiveness of a substance or product under analysis [

In the 1990s, in vitro methodologies were practically unused to verify toxicity and efficacy, however, in the early 2000s a great growth in the use of this methodology to assess genotoxicity, pharmaceutical safety and pharmacokinetic assays was seen [

 <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> is a frequently used invertebrate, where this substitution is beneficial for a number of reasons such as cost reduction, short life cycle, small size and simple fly anatomy, in addition to being able to observe a larger number of animals per experiment [

 <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> is a model of great importance as it generates information for fighting pests and disease vectors. The search for new agents that are effective in the control of vectors, explore options that are economically viable, with lower environmental pollution and lower toxicity to non-target organisms, including humans [
