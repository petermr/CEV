<p>During transport to the laboratory, the coronaries were placed in a modified Tyrode (TM or Tyrode) nutrient solution at 4 °C with the following composition in mM: (136.0 NaCl; 5.0 KCl; 0.98 MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>; 0.36 NaH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub>; 11.9 NaHCO
 <sub>3</sub>; 2.0 CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> and 5.5 glucose). The pH was adjusted to 7.4 with 1 M HCl and/or 1 M NaOH. The coronaries were dissected and sectioned into rings measuring between 4 and 5 mm in length. The coronary rings were kept in an isolated organ bath with a 10 mL capacity for the Tyrode nutrient solution, maintained under continuous aeration by air bubbling and a temperature of 37 °C. The contractile activity measurements for the tissues were recorded using a rod connected to a force transducer (TRI, model 210, Panlab, Spain), coupled to a differential amplifier (DATAQ, model PM-1000, Akron, OH, USA), with input to a digital analog converter board (DATAQ DI-200) installed on a computer, whose collected data were converted into traces and stored into files using the WINDAQ software (DATAQ Instruments, Inc. Akron, OH, USA). The isolated coronary rings were subjected to a 1 gf (gram force) tension and acclimatized for a period of 1 h. All protocols started with two subsequent contractions reproduced by the addition of 60 mM KCl (K60) to the studied coronary rings, in a hypertonic manner, where after reaching stable values, a plateau, the maximum response obtained was considered the maximum contraction of the ring. Only experiments with reproducible contractions were considered viable for the experimental series.
