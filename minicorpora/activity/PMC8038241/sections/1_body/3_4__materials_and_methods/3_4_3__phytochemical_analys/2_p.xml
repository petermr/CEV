<p>The same solution was quantified by injection in triplicate of 1 μL in the splitless mode of this solution in a gas chromatograph (Thermo trace GC ultra) equipped with non-polar column VB-5 (60 m × 0.25 mm internal diameter; film thickness 0.25 μm). The samples were analyzed under the following conditions: initial temperature of 40 °C (maintained for 2 min), heating ramp of 4 °C/min and final temperature of 230 °C, which was maintained for 5 min. The carrier gas used was nitrogen, at a constant flow of 1 mL per minute and the injector temperature was maintained at 250 °C. The compounds eluted from the chromatographic column were detected using flame burners (FID) at 250 °C.</p>
