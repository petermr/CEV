<p>The essential oil was subjected to gas chromatography with an HP-5 non-polar column (Agilent J&amp;W, Santa Clara, CA, USA, 60 m × 0.25 mm internal diameter; film thickness 0.25 μm) and coupled to a mass spectrometer with an Agilent 5975C Series quadrupole analyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The conditions of analysis were as follows: carrier gas helium with constant flow of 1 mL per min and for injection of the sample initial temperature of 40 °C (maintained for 2 min), heating ramp of 4 °C/min and final temperature of 230 °C, which was maintained for 5 min. The compounds eluted from the chromatographic column were ionized by electron impact at 70 eV. The ionization source was maintained at 230 °C and the quadrupole at 150 °C. The compounds were identified by analyzing the mass spectra of each chromatographic peak, comparing with authentic standards and calculating retention indices. The calculated values were compared with the retention rates published in the literature [
