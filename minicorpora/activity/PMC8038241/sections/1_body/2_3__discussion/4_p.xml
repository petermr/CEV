<p>The high potassium concentration generated by the addition of KCl promotes a depolarization of the membrane through a change in electrical charge, which consequently results in the activation of 
 <sc>l</sc>-type voltage dependent calcium channels (or channels sensitive to dihydropyridine) permitting the entry of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> ions from the external environment into the cytosol. The increase in intracellular Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> concentration is the protagonist of excitationâ€“contraction coupling, where this increase in cytosolic calcium concentration mediates the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, further raising calcium ion levels that are available for myosin light chain phosphorylation, one of the final stages of smooth muscle contraction [

 <sup>2+</sup>- dependent contraction, mediated by the G RhoA protein associated with Rho kinase [
