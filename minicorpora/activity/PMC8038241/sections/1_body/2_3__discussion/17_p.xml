The comparison between live and mobile flies shows a direct negative correlation, both in terms of the EODa concentration and the exposure time, which suggests that locomotor disability precedes general toxic effects, which may lead to the death of the insect, where this result may be explained by the action of essential oil constituents on different target enzymes and genes [
