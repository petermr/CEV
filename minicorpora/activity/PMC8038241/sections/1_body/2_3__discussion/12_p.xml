<p>The α-terpinene compound present in the 
 <italic>D. ambrosioides</italic> essential oil showed a toxic effect against 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. Studies have shown that the toxicity of α-terpinene against 
 <italic>Sitophilus zeamais</italic> adults has LC

 <xref rid="B45-molecules-26-02041" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Paes et al. [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-26-02041" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] showed that α-terpinene was one of the main compounds identified in the 
 <italic>C. ambrosioides</italic> essential oil, which showed an acaricidal activity. However, the use of essential oil in their entirety have shown greater toxic activity than their major constituents in isolation, thus corroborating with studies that demonstrate the toxicity of selected constituents from mixtures present a synergistic effect between the supposedly active and inactive compounds, and that the presence of all the constituents is necessary for the complete toxicity and/or action of essential oils [
