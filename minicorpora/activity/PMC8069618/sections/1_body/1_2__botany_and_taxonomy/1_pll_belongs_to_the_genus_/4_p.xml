<p>PlL is an evergreen environmentally sustainable shrub. It is well-adapted to harsh growing conditions, dryness and a warm environment, which all exercise an influence on the genotype and richness of secondary metabolites [
 <xref rid="B19-antibiotics-10-00425" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The plant is dioecious, where male and female flowers are on independent trees. The leaves are leathery, bright green and alternate. They are arranged in compound, pinnate whorls. The unisexual flowers are grouped in clusters. The globular fruit is a fleshy drupe, which ripens in August and ranges in color from red to brown in view of the different degrees of maturity [

 <xref rid="B20-antibiotics-10-00425" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Common aphid species, such as 
 <italic>Slavum wertheimae</italic> and 
 <italic>Baizongia pistaciae L</italic>., manipulate the leaves to form tumorous galls for the safety and nutriment of their larvae [
 <xref rid="B21-antibiotics-10-00425" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The galls are rich in volatile-like terpenes with an abundance of monoterpenes, Î± -pinene and limonene [
 <xref rid="B22-antibiotics-10-00425" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Their chemical composition differs from that of the healthy leaves, which have in general a higher content of sesquiterpenes [
