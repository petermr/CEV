<p>The biological activity of essential oils (EOs) and polyphenols from plants and herbs is related to the presence of different chemical classes. In this regard, terpenes and terpenoids in EOs are promising agents in the prevention and treatment of diseases [

Their beneficial effects and their roles have been evaluated for many decades in human disease, such as inflammatory diseases, tumorigenesis and neurodegeneration using cell and animal models, suggesting terpenes and terpenoids as potential chemopreventive and therapeutic agents [

Further interesting capabilities have been ascribed to polyphenols from botanical species, with molecules including tannins, flavonoids and lignin-carbohydrate complexes having been associated with strong antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties [
