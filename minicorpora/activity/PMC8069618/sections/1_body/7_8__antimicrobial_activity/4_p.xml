<p>The research started from the fact that terpenoids in EO exert a wide-spectrum of antibacterial, antifungal and even anti-viral activity, and have been demonstrated to inhibit the growth of drug-resistant microbial strains, which are difficult to be treated even by conventional antibiotics [
 <xref rid="B113-antibiotics-10-00425" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Although α-pinene together with the monoterpenes terpinene and myrcene are among the most represented fractions in the Mediterranean oils showing antimicrobial capacity (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00425-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>), it is of general interest if higher activity could be related to specific PlL chemotypes [
 <xref rid="B114-antibiotics-10-00425" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. In this context, as reported regarding the anti-inflammatory capacity, synergy between the chemical fractions of terpenes is proposed to explain PlL EO antimicrobial activities. Synergy was recently claimed to explain the inhibitory activity of the EO against 
 <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic>, 
 <italic>Tannerella forsythia</italic> and 
 <italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B49-antibiotics-10-00425" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The result was related to the pharmacological interplay of the terpenes characterizing the oil chemotype from North Sardinia, which was α-pinene-terpinen-4-ol, further augmented by the non-cannabinoid terpenoids limonene and β-myrcene, the sesquiterpenes (Z)-caryophyllene and (E)- β- caryophyllene. Similarly, the antimicrobial efficacy of extracts can be attributed to the richness of polyphenols [

 <xref rid="B111-antibiotics-10-00425" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>], in particular in regard to the concentrations of tannins, flavonoids, and lignin-carbohydrate complexes in the polyphenols mixture [
 <xref rid="B11-antibiotics-10-00425" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This is also the case with the ethanol extract of fruits, which showed the highest inhibition potential against 
 <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> in comparison to 20 other extracts of pharmaceutical plants [
 <xref rid="B112-antibiotics-10-00425" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Furthermore, the potency of the fruits extract were higher than that of the leaves and woody parts, with MIC values against 
 <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> of 8 μg/mL.
