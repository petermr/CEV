<p>Different antimicrobial activity was reported in the studies testing PlL EO and extracts. A high capacity against both bacteria and yeasts was demonstrated in regard to the leaves EO from plants growing in different regions [

 <xref rid="B58-antibiotics-10-00425" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] were found to have a limited effect against bacteria and yeasts, the ethanol and water extracts of leaves from plants growing in Sicily inhibited the growth of
