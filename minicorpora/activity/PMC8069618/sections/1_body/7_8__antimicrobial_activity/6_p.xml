<p>Concerning 
 <italic>Candida spp</italic>., the activity of PlL derivates is reportedly controversial (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00425-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Low or no susceptibility of the yeasts to the leaves extract, or to the fruits oil, was found. Despite this, PlL leaves EO from Sardinia had low MIC values against 
 <italic>C. glabrata</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> [
 <xref rid="B49-antibiotics-10-00425" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The results were explained as a consequence of the recurrence of pharmacological concentrations of six terpenes, which were above 0.05% in the fingerprint. Additionally, the EO documented the ability to inhibit COX-2 and LOX, which are very important proteins for the development of 
 <italic>Candida</italic> virulence [
