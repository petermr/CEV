<p>Starting from Paracelsus’ statement “the right dose differentiates a poison to a remedy”, investigations have been conducted with the intent to validate pharmaceutically PlL derivatives. For this reason, many studies have been conducted, in particular using in vitro and cell lines models testing different doses of PlL oil and extracts (

As a measure of risk versus benefit, many of them also applied enzymes testing, looking for the capacity of the EO and extracts to interact with the proteins and their involvement in inflammation and oxidative stress. In fact, it is well-known that the in vitro and cell lines systems are largely recommended to elucidate the safety of herbal products and propose the natural agents as nutraceuticals or xenobiotics [
