<p>In this regard, an interesting study was carried out by Romani and co-workers [
 <xref rid="B60-antibiotics-10-00425" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Using ethyl acetate and methanol fractions of PlL leaves, the authors identified a high polyphenol content in the extracts, which represented 7.5% of the leaf dry-weight. In this content, three major classes of secondary metabolites were identified: (i) gallic acid and galloyl derivatives of both glucose and quinic acid; (ii) flavonol glycosides, i.e., myricetin and quercetin glycosides; and (iii) anthocyanins, namely delphinidin 3-O-glucoside and cyanidin 3-O-glucoside. All of these represent strong antioxidant polyphenols, which have implications in the prevention of chronic and inflammatory diseases [
