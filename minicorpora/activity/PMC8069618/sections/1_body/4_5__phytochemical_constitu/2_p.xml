<p>PlL EO is constituted by a mixture of terpenes and terpenoids, mainly monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, which are also responsible for the characteristic smell and flavoring of the plant [

 <xref rid="B31-antibiotics-10-00425" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. It has been reported that terpenes in PlL are more genetically than environmentally related [
 <xref rid="B48-antibiotics-10-00425" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Nevertheless, the environment of growing, seasonability of harvesting and kind of material (edible or not-edible parts of the plant) have to be considered when explaining the differences in chemistry of the oils and extracts [
 <xref rid="B19-antibiotics-10-00425" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Up to 64 chemical constituents have been reported in the PlL EO fingerprint, in addition to other fractions that cannot be quantified by the assays [

 <xref rid="B9-antibiotics-10-00425" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and called “non-cannabinoids terpenoids”. In PlL oil, non-cannabinoid terpenoids are more likely to be represented by α-pinene, myrcene, limonene, (E)-β-caryophyllene and γ- terpinene (

 <xref rid="B9-antibiotics-10-00425" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Furthermore, it is appealing to report that when non-cannabinoid terpenoids reach a concentration equal to or higher than 0.05% in an oil, they can confer pharmacological properties to such an oil, which can be classified as pharmaceutically active [
