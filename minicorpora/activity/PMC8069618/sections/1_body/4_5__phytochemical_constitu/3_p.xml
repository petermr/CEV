<p>In view of the prevalent fractions of monoterpenes and oxygenated sesquiterpenes, the EO can be grouped into different chemotypes [
 <xref rid="B17-antibiotics-10-00425" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In this regard, the recurrent higher amount of α-pinene (16.9–19.5%) and terpinen-4-ol (7.7–16.5%) in comparison to the other compounds, allowed the classification of the oil from the leaves of PlL growing in Sardinia as the α-pinene/terpinen-4-ol chemotype [

 <xref rid="B49-antibiotics-10-00425" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Similarly, the Greek oil from PlL leaves is the α-pinene/terpinen-4-ol chemotype [

 <xref rid="B51-antibiotics-10-00425" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Nevertheless, the simultaneous existence of different chemotypes in a place can be justified by dissimilar geographical sites of harvesting in that country. An example is represented by the Corsican chemotype, which is expressed by three main phenotypes: the first is α-pinene/terpinen-4-ol; the second is terpinen-4-ol/limonene; and the third is myrcene-rich (88%) [
 <xref rid="B19-antibiotics-10-00425" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Very characteristic is the high content of δ-3-carene (65%) in the Egyptian oil [
 <xref rid="B52-antibiotics-10-00425" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], while the monoterpene terpinen-4-ol, together with α-pinene and the sesquiterpene myrcene, are among the higher represented fractions in the chemistry of PlL EO from Spain, Morocco and Turkey [

 <xref rid="B55-antibiotics-10-00425" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Conversely, α-pinene (65–86%) and β-myrcene (3%) are the major fractions which characterize the oils of mastic from plants growing in Spain [
