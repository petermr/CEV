<p>Mainly leaves and fruits are used for preparations of EO and also of water and alcoholic extracts. In 
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00425-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, the major compounds of the EO and the extracts are listed. Hydro-distillation using Clevenger-type devices, and ethanol solvent have been the more common methods to obtain, respectively, the oil and extracts from leaves and fruits. However, the oil obtained by hydro-distillation and the extracts by solvents can have different organoleptic profiles and chemical compositions. These differences, in turn, will affect some properties, among which is the antimicrobial capacity, which is reported to be higher in a material solvent extract in comparison to a hydro-distilled [
