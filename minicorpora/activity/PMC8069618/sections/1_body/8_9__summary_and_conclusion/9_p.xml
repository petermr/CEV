<p>Other important considerations concern the activity of PlL against 
 <italic>Candida</italic> infections. PlL inhibits the growth of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>C. glabrata</italic> with low MICs. In addition, the prevention of arachidonic acid oxidation by COX-2 and LOX antagonism by PlL oil should be of interest for inhibiting the development of 
 <italic>Candida</italic> biofilm and disseminations. Subsequently, PlL could act directly against the yeast and indirectly against its virulence, with no oral cytotoxicity.
