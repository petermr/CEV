<p>Among the non-cannabinoid terpenoid fractions, (E)-β-caryophyllene has been suggested to possess an important role in the anti-inflammatory activity of the oil. Interestingly, the molecule has a strong affinity to CB2, where it inhibits the release of cytokines from LPS-stimulated monocytes, such as TNF-α and IL-1 β expression. Furthermore, studies in animals have proved the relevance of (E)-β-caryophyllene in preventing ischemic/reperfusion oxidative injury when the oil was administered as a dietary assumption. In this context, studies strengthened the adjuvant capacity of α-pinene merged with caryophyllene, in PlL oils by the high anti-inflammatory properties. Conversely, when merged with the non-cannabinoid myrcene, caryophyllene contributed to inhibit nitric oxide production and IL-1β-induced iNOS mRNA, NF-kB and other catabolic and inflammatory mediators of importance in rheumatoid arthritis. Regarding the limonene fraction of the EO, it should be relevant in the oxidative stress-related diseases by inhibiting pro-inflammatory mediators, leukocyte migration and the vascular permeability.</p>
