<p>The chemistry shows that PlL EO is composed of up to 64 molecules, while 46 constituents have been identified in the extracts. Further minor fractions were determined in the reports analyzing both the EO and the extracts even if they could not be quantified. The more recurrent chemical components in the EO from plants growing in the Mediterranean area are represented by Î±-pinene, terpinenes, caryophyllene, limonene and myrcene. Important properties in antagonizing immune-mediated and autoimmunity, neuro-inflammatory, neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, in addition to infections and cancer have been addressed to these molecules. However, the biological character of PlL cannot be entirely focused on one of the main concentrated molecules. The abilities should be attributed to the whole mixture of the terpenes working in synergy, or in addition independently by their concentration in the agent. It is remarkable to note that concentrations of non-cannabinoid terpenoids equal to or above 0.05% increase the pharmacological potency of PlL oil.</p>
