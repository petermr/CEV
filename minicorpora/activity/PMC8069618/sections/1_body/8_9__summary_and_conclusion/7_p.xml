<p>The high antioxidant property of the extracts is remarkable in the literature. This fact has been explained by the richness of polyphenols, including tannins and flavonoids, and sterols showing high protection against free radical damage. Animal testing further supports the in vitro anti-ROS potency of PlL extracts, with a higher effect in comparison to NADPHs. Notably, the aqueous formulations show great capacity in inhibiting lipid peroxidation. The mechanism is interpreted as scavenging of peroxyl radicals, which suggests PlL to be preventive in cardiovascular disease and cancer. Furthermore, the antioxidant properties of polyphenols in PlL extracts should be beneficial in therapy and prevention of gastrointestinal diseases, where oxidative stress has been shown to damage the barrier protection, leading to intestinal pathologies. In this matter, the proved capacity of polyphenols to manage the microbial and metabolomic patterns in the body might represent an additional advantage. These facts should validate scientifically the popular use of PlL extracts to resolve infections and persistent inflammation at the intestinal tract, proposing the materials as natural agents in prevention and therapy of gastro-intestinal diseases.</p>
