<p>In regard to the antimicrobial activity, the capacity of the oil and extracts against periodontal bacteria has been largely documented. These evidences can prove scientifically the popular use of PlL in the relief of gingival bleeding and tooth ache. The ability against periodontal bacteria, further ameliorated by the anti-inflammatory potency, is attractive with regards to a possible use of the EO to antagonize gingivitis, as a primary strategy to prevent periodontitis and as a secondary preventive strategy to prevent recurrent periodontitis after periodontal surgery. The possibility to formulate PlL derivates as potential oral health care products or therapeutics in periodontal disease is further strengthened by the largely documented biocompatibility and antioxidant capacity.</p>
