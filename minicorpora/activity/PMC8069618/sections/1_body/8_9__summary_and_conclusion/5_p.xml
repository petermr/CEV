<p>Regarding the anti-inflammatory capacity, PlL EO and extracts are able to inhibit the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α. Additionally, the capacity to anatgonize the arachidonic acid cascade was highlighted in previous studies. In particular, the antagonism towards the COX-2 enzyme emerged in the research, and then the ability to antagonize the first phase of the active inflammation by inhibiting prostaglandins. Furthermore, the potential LOX inhibitory capability could propose the EO as a COX-2-LOX dual inhibitory natural compound, which might be promising against inflammation and tissue damage.</p>
