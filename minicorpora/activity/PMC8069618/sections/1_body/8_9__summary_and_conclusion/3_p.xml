<p>Regarding the extracts, the high polyphenol content is attractive for prevention, and for therapy of chronic illness and infections. The richness in polyphenols suggests the use of the extracts as nutraceuticals in human health. Among the compounds, flavonol glycosides, i.e., myricetin and quercetin glycosides, could indicate a possible role of PlL in preventing diabetic complications and managing intestinal inflammatory response. Meanwhile, the concentration of bioactive flavanones should put forward the extracts to manage cholesterol absorption, glucose and lipid metabolism. Furthermore, the quinic acid, lignans and anthocyanins content is attractive in view of the high antioxidant capacity, in particular when water-extracted from PlL.</p>
