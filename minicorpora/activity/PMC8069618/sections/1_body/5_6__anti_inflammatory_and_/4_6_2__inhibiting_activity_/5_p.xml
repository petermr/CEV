<p>Animal testing further explored the anti-ROS efficacy of PlL derivates. Ben Khedir and co-workers [
 <xref rid="B70-antibiotics-10-00425" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] determined the scavenger and anti-inflammatory activity of the fruits oil using the carrageenan-induced paw edema in a rat model. In that study, PlL oil demonstrated significantly better anti-inflammatory activity with edema inhibition, in comparison to those produced by the control NADPH. Moreover, PlL oil was able to increase the expression of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase, which are released as a response to the oxidative stress in the inflamed tissue. The effects were interpreted as a consequence of the content of humulene, caryophyllene and polyunsaturated fatty acid in the oil. Humulene and caryophyllene have been shown to inhibit the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) pathway, responsible for the transcription of several proinflammatory cytokines, i.e., TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and iNOS and COX-2 enzymes [
