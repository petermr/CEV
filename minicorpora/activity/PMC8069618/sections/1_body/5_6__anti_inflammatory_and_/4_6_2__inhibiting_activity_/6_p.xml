<p>Other in vivo studies demonstrated that an administration of PlL oil before the induction of the Bilateral Common Carotid Artery Occlusion followed by Reperfusion (BCCAO/R) was able to prevent the oxidative stress challenge in the nervous tissue due to the ischemic insult [

Additionally, PlL oil increased the concentration of the anti-inflammatory endocannabinoid congeners palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and oleoylethanolamide (OEA) [

The outcomes were related to the high presence of the phytocannabinoid (E)-β-caryophyllene, which worked synergistically with the other compounds in the oil, expanding the levels of cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2) and PPAR-alpha receptors. Further studies attest to the role of β-caryophyllene as CB2 agonists, demonstrating its capacity to antagonize the release of cytokines from LPS-stimulated monocytes (TNF-α and IL-1 β) [
