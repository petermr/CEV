<p>The protective effect of PlL EO and extracts against ROS has been deeply documented in the literature (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00425-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). From a scientific point of view, this capacity can be related to the terpenes and polyphenols of the EO and of the extracts, respectively [

 <xref rid="B59-antibiotics-10-00425" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. As the accumulation of ROS directly affects the healthy tissue systems, including cellular lipids, nucleic acids and proteins [
 <xref rid="B98-antibiotics-10-00425" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>], the capacity of the EO and the extracts was studied directly using cell lines and intracellular ROS evaluation assays, or by chemical methods, particularly using the 2,20-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) and the 1,1-diphenyl-2- picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) chemical assays, and more recently using electron chemical devices.
