<p>As it is shown in 
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00425-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, the anti-ROS ability has been mainly investigated in PlL extracts. Scientifically, this ability has been addressed to the richness in polyphenols the extracts possess, which not only inhibits the production of ROS by the direct involvement of specific molecules [
 <xref rid="B99-antibiotics-10-00425" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>], but also can modulate the Keap1-Nrf2/ARE pathway [
 <xref rid="B100-antibiotics-10-00425" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. This is a powerful oxidation-reduction defense system, where polyphenols act to degrade specifically the Keap1 protein and regulate the Nrf2-related pathway [
