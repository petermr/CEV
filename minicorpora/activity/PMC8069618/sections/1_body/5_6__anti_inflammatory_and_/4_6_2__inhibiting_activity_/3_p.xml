<p>Remila and co-workers [

Furthermore, due to the activation of apoptosis mechanisms, the extracts significantly inhibited the growth of melanoma cells. The data was related to the richness in phenolics, flavonoids and tannins in the extracts. Similar conclusions were obtained by Atmani [

In relation to the peak of hydroxyl groups, the aqueous formulations strongly inhibited lipid peroxidation. The mechanism was explained by the scavenging of peroxyl radicals by the extracts. Radicals play a role in the development of cardiovascular disease and cancer. In this regard, the scavenger activity of gallic acid and galloylquinic derivatives, isolated from PlL leaves, is particularly attractive. Notably, a progressive increase in the anti-radical activity associated with the number of galloyl groups in quinic acid was found [
