<p>Comparable anti-inflammatory values were reported in regard to PlL EO using the carrageenan-induced paw edema and cotton pellet-induced granuloma in a rat model [
 <xref rid="B29-antibiotics-10-00425" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Particularly, it was evidenced that when applied topically, PlL EO from leaves significantly inhibited the development of granuloma and the serum level of TNF-α and IL-6 in reply to the irritants. The result was mainly related to the activity of α-pinene, β-pinene, α- phellandrene and sabinene, which were highly represented in the chemistry of the hydrodistilled oil.
