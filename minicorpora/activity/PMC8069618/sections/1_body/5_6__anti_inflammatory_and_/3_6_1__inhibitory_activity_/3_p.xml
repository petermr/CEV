<p>Only one study has investigated the inhibitory activity of the whole PlL EO. It was obtained from the leaves of plants growing in Sardinia and tested against COXs and LOX [
 <xref rid="B49-antibiotics-10-00425" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were 10.3 ± 4.4 μg/mL and 6.1 ± 2.5 μg/mL PlL EO for COX-1 and COX-2, respectively, with higher inhibitory activity toward COX-2 in comparison to that produced towards COX-1. Additionally, COX-2 inhibition by the EO was similar to that recorded using ibuprofen as a positive control. The activity of the oil against LOX did not reach the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value, as PlL EO lowered LOX activity by 30% compared to the control. Despite the low LOX inhibition, the study strengthens the oil as a potential dual inhibitory compound, which was intensively researched in pharmacology to antagonize a great number of inflammatory processes where these enzymes sustain and amplify the disease [

The data obtained in that investigation were addressed to the mixture of terpenoids comprising the oil, with particular regard to α-pinene and terpinen-4-ol (33.38%), enriched by the non-cannabinoid terpenoid limonene (3.4%), β-myrcene (0.9%), (Z)-caryophyllene (1.4%) and (E)-β-caryophyllene (0.1%). The mixture allowed the classification of the oil as pharmacologically active [
