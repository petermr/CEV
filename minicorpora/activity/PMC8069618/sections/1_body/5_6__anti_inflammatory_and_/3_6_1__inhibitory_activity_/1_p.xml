<p>Remila and co-workers [
 <xref rid="B96-antibiotics-10-00425" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>] examined the anti-inflammatory activity of leaves and fruits extracts by measuring the secretion of IL-1β by macrophages exposed to adenosin triphosphate (ATP) or H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. The authors found PlL leaves extract significantly reduced the production of IL-1β from ATP- or H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-activated cells. The inhibitory capacity of the leaves extract was higher in comparison to that of the fruits and of quercetin and gallic acid (tested as isolated fractions of the polyphenol mixture). The data was explained by the higher content of the total phenols and flavonoids in the leaves compared to the fruits and by the synergy between the pharmacological biomolecules of PlL extract. Similar considerations and a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory effect of the leaves extract was reported in other studies, which further strengthened the capacity of flavonoids and tannins [
