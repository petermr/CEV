<p>As mentioned above, the anti-inflammatory effect of PlL is of high relevance in ethnopharmacology. The presence of important anti-inflammatory terpenes in the composition of PlL EO can explain its efficacy. It is well-demonstrated that terpenes are capable of inhibiting several inflammatory molecules, e.g., IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα and COX-2 [

Meanwhile, the anti-inflammatory properties of PlL extracts can be related to the richness of polyphenols, the interplay of which in the inflammatory cascade is mainly demonstrated toward macrophages by inhibiting multiple key regulators of the inflammatory response [

The ability of these natural compounds to modify the expression of several pro-inflammatory genes in addition to their antioxidant characteristics, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, contributes to the regulation of inflammatory signaling [
