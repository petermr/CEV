<p>The chemical constituents of the (AJ) EO were investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02831-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Nineteen compounds were qualitatively and quantitatively characterized in the EO of the (AJ) leaves, representing 100% of the total EO mass, as presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02831-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, where bornyl acetate (63.40%) and endo-borneol (17.75%) were identified as the abundant ingredients. Moreover, the major phytochemical classes were oxygenated monoterpenoids (85.98%) and oxygenated sesquiterpenoid (8.01%).
