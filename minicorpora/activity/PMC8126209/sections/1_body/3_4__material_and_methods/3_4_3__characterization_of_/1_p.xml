<p>The phytochemical profile of A (AJ) EO was determined utilizing a gas chromatograph (Hewlett Packard HP 5890 Series II, Houston, TX, USA) connected with mass spectrometry (PerkinElmer, Elite-5-MS, Massachusetts, United States) with a fused-silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, with a film thickness of 0.25 µm). at a flow rate of 1.1 mL/min, the helium gas was set while the injector temperature was fixed at 250 °C, the oven temperature was set at 50 °C for 5 min followed by a ramp of 4.0 °C/min to 280 °C. The total running time was 62.50 min, and the solvent delay was from 0 to 4.0 min. The mass spectroscopy (MS) scan time was from 4 to 62.5 min, covering a mass range of 50.00 to 300.00 m/z. The mass spectra were collected under electronic ionization conditions at 70 eV [

In brief, retention indices (RIs) have been calculated according to the injected standard mixture of normal alkanes (C6–C27) under the mentioned conditions using the following well-known equation approved by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) (

The identification was also confirmed by comparison of their mass spectra with those stored in the Wiley7n.l MS computer library. The linear temperature-programmed RIs of all the constituents were calculated from the gas chromatogram by interpolation between bracketing

 <disp-formula>RI = 100 × (((tR(i) − tR(z))/(tR(z + 1) − tR(z))) + z)
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where z is the number of carbon atoms in the smaller n-alkane and tR(i), tR(z), and tR(z+1) are the retention times of the desired compound, the smaller n-alkane, and the larger n-alkane, respectively.
