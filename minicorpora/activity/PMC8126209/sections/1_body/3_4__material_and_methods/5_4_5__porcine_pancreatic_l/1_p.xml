<p>A working solution (1 mg/mL) was done by dissolving 100 mg of the (AJ) EO in 100 mL of 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Riedeldehan, Seelze, Germany). Then, the obtained solution was diluted to produce the following concentrations: 400, 300, 200, 100, and 50 μg/mL. Porcine pancreatic lipase enzyme (Sigma, St. Louis,, MO, USA) stock solution (1 mg/mL) was directly prepared before use by dissolving 25 mg of lipase enzyme powder in 25 mL of 10% DMSO. Then, 
 <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenyl butyrate (
 <italic>P</italic>NPB) (Sigma-Aldrich, Schnelldorf, Germany) stock solution was prepared by dissolving 20.9 mg of 
 <italic>P</italic>NPB in 2 mL of acetonitrile. From the prepared serial dilutions of the (AJ) EO, 0.2 mL was mixed with 0.1 mL of the lipase enzyme stock solution and tris-HCl (Sigma, MO, USA) to reach a volume of 1 mL. Then, the solution was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in a water bath. After 15 min, 100 μL of 
 <italic>P</italic>NPB solution was added, and the solution was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. A 1 mL blank solution was prepared by mixing 100 μL of lipase enzyme (1 mg/mL) solution with a tris-HCl solution. The commercial anti-obesity drug orlistat (Sigma-Aldrich, Schnelldorf, Germany) was utilized as a positive control, and we followed the same previous steps as the (AJ) EO. The absorbance was measured utilizing a UV–Vis-spectrophotometer at 405 nm. However, the lipase enzyme inhibitory potential was measured utilizing the following equation:
 <disp-formula>I (%) = [ABS
  <sub>blank</sub> − ABS
  <sub>test</sub>]/[ABS
  <sub>blank</sub>]) × 100%
  <label>(3)</label>
 </disp-formula> where I (%) is the percent inhibition of the lipase enzyme [
