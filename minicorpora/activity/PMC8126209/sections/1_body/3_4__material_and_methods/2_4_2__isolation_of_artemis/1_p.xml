Briefly, 0.1 kg of the dried leaf powder was suspended with 1 L of distilled water, and the EO was extracted at 100 °C using a Clevenger device (Deschem, Changshu, China) operating at atmospheric pressure for 180 min. The obtained (AJ) EO was chemically dried utilizing calcium carbonate and stored at 2 °C in a refrigerator until further use. The extracted EO yield was 1.31%
