<p>The α-glucosidase inhibitory activity of the (AJ) EO was determined according to the standard protocol, with some modifications [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-26-02831" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In each test tube, a reaction mixture containing 50 μL of phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH = 6. 8), 10 μL of α-glucosidase (1 U/mL), and 20 μL of varying concentrations of (AJ) EO (100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 μg/mL) was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Then, the preincubated 20 μL of (5 mM) 
 <italic>P</italic>NPG (4-Nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside) was added as a substrate of the reaction and was again incubated at 37 °C for an additional 20 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 50 μL of Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> (0.1 M). The absorbance of the released p-nitrophenol was measured by a UV–Vis spectrophotometer at 405 nm. With similar concentrations as the plant EO, acarbose was used as a positive control.
