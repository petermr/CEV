Therefore, the current investigation was focused on assessing the ability of the (AJ) EO to inhibit the target carbohydrate metabolic enzyme inhibitors, including α-amylase and α-glucosidase. The results showed that the tested EO exhibited α-amylase suppressing effect compared with the positive control, acarbose, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 14.17 ± 0.39 and 8.53 ± 0.72 μg/mL, respectively, at the tested concentrations (10, 50, 70, 100, and 500 μg/mL). Notably, the (AJ) EO exhibited strong α-glucosidase inhibitory potential at the tested concentrations (100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 mg/mL), with inhibition in a concentration-dependent manner, compared with the positive control, acarbose, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 144.45 ± 0.88 and 62.36 ± 1.05 μg/mL, respectively.
