<p>The current study results showed better inhibition activity of the extracted (AJ) EO as 50 µg/mL caused 57.2% and 42.5% inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2, respectively. However, the (AJ) EO has more selectivity towards COX-1 hence its COX-2 inhibition selectivity &lt; 1 (0.017) compared with that of the commercial pharmaceutical preparation celecoxib [

 <sub>50</sub> values of 15.64 and 91.91 µg/mL, respectively, compared with the pharmaceutical anti-inflammatory drug ketoprofen which has an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 7.89 and 40.18 µg/mL, respectively.
