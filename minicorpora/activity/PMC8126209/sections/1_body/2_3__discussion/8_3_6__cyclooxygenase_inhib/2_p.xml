<p>The (AJ) EO COX inhibition activity test showed that the EO has more selective inhibition towards COX-1. Its COX-2 selectivity value hence was lower (0.17) and comparable to that of ketoprofen (0.196). The percentage inhibition of COX-2 increased with an increase in the concentration of EO used. When the EO concentration was increased from 50 to 350 µg/mL, inhibition increased from 42.9% to 65.3%. Similarly, COX-1 inhibition also increased with increasing EO concentration. Increasing the EO concentration from 50 to 350 µg/mL caused an increase in COX-1 inhibition from 57.2% to 68.2%.</p>
