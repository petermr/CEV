<p>Interestingly, the (AJ) EO showed a ten-fold more potent antifungal activity against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> than the commercial anticandidal drug fluconazole, with a MIC of 0.156 and 1.56 μg/mL, respectively. There was no noticeable difference in sensitivity between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, while it is understood that the Gram-negative bacteria are less susceptible to EOs due to the existence of hydrophilic lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in their outer membrane. LPS prevents various hydrophobic EO compounds from penetrating the membrane. Actually, EOs and their hydrophobic ingredients can destroy bacterial cell membranes by removing their lipid fraction, impairing the bacterial cell’s ability to survive [
