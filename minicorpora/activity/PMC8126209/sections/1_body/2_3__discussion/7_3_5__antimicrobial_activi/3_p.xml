<p>The EO from the dried leaves of (AJ) showed potent antimicrobial properties with higher antibacterial activity against MRSA, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. vulgaris</italic>, each showing a MIC of 0.625 μg/mL than the commercial antibiotic ciprofloxacin which has a MIC of 12.5, 0.78, and 15 μg/mL, respectively. The EO also showed more potent antibacterial activity than ampicillin which does not have antibacterial activity against MRSA and has weak antibacterial activity against the rest of the bacterial strains. Indeed, the EO did not show any inhibitory activity against the growth of
