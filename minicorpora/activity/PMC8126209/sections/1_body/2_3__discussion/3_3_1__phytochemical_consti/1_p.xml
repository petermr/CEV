<p>The chemical ingredients of EOs depend on the plantâ€™s species, climatic conditions, origin, and seasonal variations. The phytochemical composition of (AJ) EO was identified and quantified utilizing GC-MS; 19 molecules were identified in the screened EO, representing 100% of the total mass. The results revealed that (AJ) EO is mainly composed of oxygenated monoterpenoid, monoterpene hydrocarbon, sesquiterpene hydrocarbon, and oxygenated sesquiterpenoid phytochemical classes which accounted for 85.98%, 4.28%, 1.66%, and 8.01%, respectively. The major identified components were bornyl acetate (63.40%), endo-borneol (17.75%), and geranyl isovalerate (7.67%).</p>
