<p>These days, EOs have been thoroughly investigated as potential antioxidant agents to replace synthetic ones. In fact, EOs are mixtures of oxygenated terpenoids, monoterpene, sesquiterpenes, phenols, and other molecules. In most cases, the antioxidant activity of the EOs can be easily explained by the presence of oxygenated hydrocarbons such as sesquiterpenoids and monoterpenoids in their composition which are well-known as potent antioxidants and able to trap the chain-carrying lipid peroxyl radicals responsible for lipid oxidation. Recently, it has been reported that other simple components of EOs including terpenoids may potentially contribute to the scavenging of the harmful free radicals [
