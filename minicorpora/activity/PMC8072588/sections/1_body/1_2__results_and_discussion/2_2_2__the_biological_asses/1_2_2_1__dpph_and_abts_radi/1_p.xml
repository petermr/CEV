 <sub>50</sub> with DPPH 41.09 mg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup> (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00786-t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>) and equivalent mass 0.657 mgVE/gEOs and IC
 <sub>50</sub> with ABTS 10.84 mg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup> (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00786-t009" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>); the equivalent mass here is VEAC = 3.487 mgVE/gEOs, and according to the equivalent antioxidant capacity results, it appears that the leaves essential oil has the greatest scavenging activity. The results shown in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00786-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00786-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> and 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00786-t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref> were used to compare the strength of essential oils’ activity with reference compounds known for their strong antioxidant activity. The results of these tables were also used to calculate the equivalent antioxidant capacity of the essential oil per gram of the reference compound. These results clearly demonstrated the moderate antioxidant activity of the 
 <italic>Thymus algeriensis</italic> oil. The results obtained on IC50 values (8379 mg/mL) are consistent with those of Ali et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-10-00786" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In agreement with Hazzit et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-plants-10-00786" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00786-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), it is difficult to compare the IC50 values that we obtained with the results of previous publications for the same plant due to the different conditions of each experiment and the concentrations and volumes used. The antioxidant activity of essential oil was claimed to be attributed to the presence of phenolic constituents in plant oils, especially thymol and/or carvacrol as major compounds. However, those compounds are absent in the studied essential oil. The results imply that other non-phenolic compounds are responsible for this activity.
