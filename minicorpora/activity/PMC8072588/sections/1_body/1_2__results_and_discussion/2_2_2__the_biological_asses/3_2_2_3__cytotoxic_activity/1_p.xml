<p>The cytotoxic activity test (in vitro bioassay on human tumor cell lines) was conducted and determined by the Bioassay-Cell Culture Laboratory, National Research Centre, Cairo, Egypt. The cytotoxic activity of 
 <italic>Thymus algeriensis</italic> essential oil was tested on the two cell lines: HCT116 (colon cell line) and HePG2 (human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line) (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00786-t013" ref-type="table">Table 13</xref>). The cytotoxicity evaluation was performed for sample concentrations of essential oil that ranged between 12.5 and 100 μg/mL using MTT assays. The results are shown in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00786-t015" ref-type="table">Table 15</xref>. The essential oil possesses a cytotoxic activity on HCT116. As a consequence, the LC50 (lethal concentration of E. oil that causes the death of 50% of cells in 48 h) and LC90 (lethal concentration of E. oil that causes the death of 90% of cells in 48 h) were found to be 39.8 and 59.6 μg/mL, respectively. The inhibition percentage of this essential oil against HCT116 colon cancer cells lines is 100% for 100 μg/mL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00786-f002">Figure 2</xref>); this result shows the good effectiveness of this oil when comparing LC50 between it and the reference compound (Doxorubicin), as it is almost equal to it in effectiveness. On the other hand, from the same

 <italic>Thymus algeriensis</italic> essential oil against HCT116 (colon cell line) showed that the dose of IC50 is 64.13 ± 1.33 μg/mL. In fact, the results obtained on the HCT116 colon cancer cell line were very important compared with the positive control of Adriamycin (Doxorubicin), which is 37.6 μg/mL.
