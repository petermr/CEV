<p>Kurtosis is understood as the degree of clustering of individual units of the community due to the studied variable around the arithmetic mean of this variable, which means in this case the deformation of the distribution due to the flattening or slenderness of the abundance curve. The more slender the abundance curve, the stronger the concentration (degree of concentration), and the more flattened the abundance curve, the weaker the concentration (degree of concentration). In the case of the remediation index, the value of kurtosis was below 3.0, which means a flattened curve; in other cases, this value was &gt;3, which means a slender curvature of the aggregation of these results. The measures of asymmetry (skewness) determined the direction of the distribution of the examined variable features in the community and the degree of deviation of the variable feature distribution from the symmetric distribution. The distribution of the examined features turned out to be asymmetric on the right side (positive asymmetry). Asymmetry means deformation of the distribution of the studied variables due to the extension of the abundance curve to the right in relation to the dominant. The bigger the asymmetry of the distribution, the smaller the cognitive value of the arithmetic mean and other classical measures (
