<p>Three repetitions were used for samples, and triplicates were made for each measurement in all tests. Results are expressed as mean values and standard deviations (SD). Statistical calculations were performed using SAS Enterprise 4.2 software [
 <xref rid="B29-plants-10-00786" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Statistical analyses were based on one-way models of analysis of variance (ANOVA) in laboratory experiments with multiple T-Tukey tests, with the adopted significance level 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.05. T-Tukey’s multiple comparative tests enable a detailed comparative analysis of means by distinguishing statistically homogeneous groups of means (homogeneous groups), which determine the so-called smallest significant differences of means. In Tukey’s tests, they are designated as HSD (Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference).
