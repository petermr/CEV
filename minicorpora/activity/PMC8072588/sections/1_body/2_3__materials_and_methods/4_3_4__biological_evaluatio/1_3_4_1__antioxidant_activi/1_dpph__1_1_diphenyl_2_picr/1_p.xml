<p>The DPPH scavenging assay has been selected as a primary test to be performed at the initial screening of extracts due to its relatively low cost and the high stability of this chemical regent [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-10-00786" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The ability of the tested extracts to scavenge the free radical reagent DPPH˙ was assessed according to protocol described by Lue et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-10-00786" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In test tubes, 1 mL of a fresh methanolic–DPPH solution (250 µM) was vortexed with 1 mL of varied extract concentrations; then, it was incubated at room temperature for half an hour. After incubation, the combination absorbance was calculated against a blank at 517 nm wavelength using a Helios Omega UV/Vis spectrometry. The inhibition percentage was determined using the following Equation (1):
