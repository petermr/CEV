<p>The analysis of the extracted essential oil was performed using an Agilent GC7890a gas chromatography equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a capillary fused bonded column Rtx-5MS (Crossbond diphenyl dimethyl polysiloxane, 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 µm film thickness). The injector and detector temperature were kept at 250 °C and 300 °C, respectively. A volume of 1 μL solution, prepared by 5% vol. EO dilution in n-hexane was injected in split mode (1:50). Nitrogen was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The column temperature was programmed at 60 °C to 280 °C with an increase increment of 3 °C/min and then left maintained at 280 °C for 5 min. The percentages of the chemical constituents were calculated relative to peaks areas determined by electronic integration of the FID detector.</p>
