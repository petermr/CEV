<p id="para0018">The growth and feed utilization of growing quails were improved by supplementation of LGEO. Similar to our results, 
 <xref rid="bib0037" ref-type="bibr">Mukhtar et al. (2012)</xref> clarified that the addition of LGEO in the broiler chicks' diet significantly improved performance indices (BWG, FI, and FCR) compared to the control group. 
 <xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr">Khattak et al. (2014)</xref> stated that the inclusion of lemongrass in the diet enhanced BWG with positive effects on FCR of broiler chicks. 
 <xref rid="bib0048" ref-type="bibr">Tiwari et al. (2018)</xref> detected that BWG was higher in the LGEO-received birds compared to the control group without LGEO. This improvement may be attributed to the active compounds, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of the LGEO. Additionally, this positive effect of LGEO on performance may due to that this oil lead to the better digestion of nutrients.
