<p id="para0020">The blood biochemistry of poultry suggests their physiological disposition in the nutritional plane. The improvement of biochemical parameters indicates a better physiological status of the birds. In the current study, dietary supplementation of LGEO boosted the total protein, albumin and reduced liver enzyme activities. The results were consistent with previous investigations, 
 <xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">Alzawqari et al. (2016)</xref> illustrated that serum total protein and globulin were significantly increased with the addition of lemongrass leaves in the diet compared to the control group. The dietary inclusion of lemongrass in broiler diet lowered liver enzyme activities (

The low levels of liver enzymes in birds administered with the LGEO might be owing to it could repair hepatic injury or restore the cellular permeability that can be caused by cytotoxic and mutagenic compounds. Therefore, this was consistent with the results of
