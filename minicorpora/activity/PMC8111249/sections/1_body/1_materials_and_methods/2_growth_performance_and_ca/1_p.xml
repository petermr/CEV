 <bold>BWG</bold>]) and feed utilization (feed intake [
 <bold>FI</bold>], and feed conversion ratio [
 <bold>FCR</bold>]) were evaluated at 1, 3, and 5 wk of age. For carcass evaluation, at the end of the experimental period, 25 quail birds were randomly weighed, and slaughtered after fasting for 6 h. All the edible organs and parts including liver, heart, gizzard, and eviscerated carcass were weighed, and the results were expressed as a percentage of the final body weight.
