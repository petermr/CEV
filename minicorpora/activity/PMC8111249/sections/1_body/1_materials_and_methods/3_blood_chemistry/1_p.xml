<p id="para0007">Blood samples were collected at the end of the trial from the slaughtered quails. Blood samples were collected in heparinized tubes to obtain plasma after centrifugation for 15 minutes at 3,000 rpm. Plasma metabolites including protein and its fraction, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine, urea, triglycerides, total cholesterol and its fractions (high density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein 
 <bold>[LDL]</bold>, and very-low-density lipoprotein
 <bold>[VLDL]</bold>), and immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA and IgM) were determined using an automatic analyzer with a commercial kits from Bio-diagnostic Company (Giza, Egypt) according to the manufacture procedure. Plasma lysosomal activity was assessed with a 96-well microplate turbidity assay. Malondialdehyde (
 <bold>MDA</bold>), superoxide dismutase, catalase, total antioxidant capacity, and reduced glutathione (
 <bold>GSH</bold>) colorimetrically using microplate spectrophotometer with a commercial detection kit (Bio-diagnostic, Egypt) following the manufacturer's instructions.
