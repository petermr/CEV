<p id="para0011">The effects of LGEO supplementation on growth performance of growing quails during the experimental periods are displayed in 
 <xref rid="tbl0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The birds fed diets containing LGEO had a significantly higher BW at 3 wk of age and BWG from 1 to 3 wk (linear, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) compared with that in the control group. All levels of LGEO (except 600 mg/ kg diet) increased BW at 5 wk of age (quadratic, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) and BWG from 3 to 5 (linear and quadratic, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) and 1 to 5 wk (quadratic, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) compared with that in the control group. FI during the period from 1 to 3 wk was lowered (linear and quadratic, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) in the quail fed 150 and 300 mg LGEO/kg diet compared with that in the control group. During the period from 3 to 5 wk of age, FI was significantly decreased in the birds received LGEO (600 mg/kg diet) diets compared with that of the control. However, there were no statistical differences in FI between the treatments during the period from 1 to 5 wk of age. Feed conversion ratio was improved with addition of LGEO in quail diet during the periods (from 1 to 3 wk and from 1 to 5 wk). During the period of 3 to 5 wk of age, the quails fed LGEO (300 and 450 mg/kg diet) had better FCR than the control and other treatments.
