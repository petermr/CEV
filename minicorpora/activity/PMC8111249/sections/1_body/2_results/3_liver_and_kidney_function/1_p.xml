 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) in the LGEO levels of 150, 300 and 450 mg/kg compared with that in the control group. The quails fed diets containing LGEO levels had lower aspartate aminotransferase (linear, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) than those in the control group. Dietary LGEO levels (300, 450, and 600 mg/kg) reduced lactate dehydrogenase values compared with the control group. The highest creatinine value was observed in quails fed 600 mg LGEO/kg diet (linear and quadratic, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05).
