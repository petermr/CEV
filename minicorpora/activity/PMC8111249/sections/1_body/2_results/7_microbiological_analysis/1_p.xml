<p id="para0017">The results of the caecal microbiota of growing Japanese quail as affected by dietary treatments are shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl0008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>. The dietary supplementation of LGEO levels (300 and 450 mg/kg) increased total bacterial count and 
 <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> count (linear and quadratic, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) compared with the control group. However, the groups fed a diet supplemented with LGEO exhibited lower 
 <italic>Coliform, E. coli, Salmonella</italic> colonization (linear and quadratic, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) than those in the control group.
