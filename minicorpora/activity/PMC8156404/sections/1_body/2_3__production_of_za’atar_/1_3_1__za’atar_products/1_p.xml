The consumer has higher acceptability of fresh za’atar in autumn and winter for its milder taste due to the reduction in the essential oil concentration caused by rainfall. Nevertheless, the harvesting of fresh za’atar must end in early spring, which is the pre-blooming period, in order to give time for the blooming biomass to recover before the harvesting time of dried za’atar in July and June. Dried Za’atar mix products are composed of leaves and inflorescences. Their final form is grounded pure za’atar or za’atar with other ingredient mixes. The harvesting of za’atar for dried za’atar products is preferred to be carried out during the full blooming stage. Essential oil products are produced from the leaves and inflorescences of za’atar in an extracted essential oil or water form. The market value of different essential oil profiles is different. Therefore, knowing and testing the market need is necessary in order to produce the requested profile [
