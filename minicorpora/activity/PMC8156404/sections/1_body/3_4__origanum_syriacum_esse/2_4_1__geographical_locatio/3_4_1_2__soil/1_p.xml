<p>Soil pH and composition have an impact on both 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> essential oil yield and composition. Different soil types and conditions have been found to affect 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> essential oil in two studies. Choosing the proper soil type and conditions will depend on the compound of interest in the essential oil and how they affect it [

 <xref rid="B23-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. There was a significant positive correlation between essential oil yield and soil pH as well as soil phosphorus content (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), while the positive correlation between essential oil yield and organic matter, nitrogen, and potassium was low and insignificant. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) results show that soil pH and composition affected the essential oil contents. Both soil pH and P
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>5</sub> content were significantly negatively correlated with carvacrol, thymoquinone, and p-cymene, and they were significantly positively correlated with thymol, while thymol was significantly negatively correlated with nitrogen, K
 <sub>2</sub>O, and organic matter content [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. For soil types, manure, vegetable compost, non-sterilized, and non-inoculated soils produced 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> essential oil with high thymol content. On the other hand, nursery, potting, professional agricultural mixtures, sterilized inoculated, sterilized non-inoculated, and non-sterilized inoculated soils produced 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> essential oil high in both thymol and carvacrol. Water, organic matter, and mineral rate improve the essential oil yield. Moreover, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) enhances the water and nutrient intake and plant growth, which improves essential oil yield as well. It was noted that AMF promoted the carvacrol and reduced the thymol levels in 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> essential oil [
