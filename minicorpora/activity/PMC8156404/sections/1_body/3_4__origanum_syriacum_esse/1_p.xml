<p>Several studies have been conducted to determine the composition of za’atar essential oil. One hundred and seven compounds have been identified in 19 za’atar essential oil samples in 13 studies conducted on za’atar from Syria [

 <xref rid="B19-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The levels of compounds were reported as their chromatogram areas’ percentages. One hundred and seven different compounds were found in za’atar samples. The most common compound was thymol, which was detected in all essential oils, followed by γ–terpinene and carvacrol, which were found in 18 essential oils, then α-pinene, found in 17 samples, and α-terpinene, found in 16 samples. Other common compounds were p-cymene, β-pinene, caryophyllene oxide, α-terpineol, α-thujene, terpinen-4-ol, camphene, and borneol. Among all compounds in za’atar essential oils, carvacrol, thymol, α-terpinene, o-thymol, γ–terpinene, ß-myrcene, cis-sabinene hydrate, terpinen-4-ol, p-cymene, caryophyllene, and β-caryophyllene had the highest levels. Compounds with the highest variations among their levels in the studies were carvacrol, thymol, ß-myrcene, α-terpinene, cis-sabinene hydrate, γ–terpinene, and β-caryophyllene. There was a wide variety of the detected compounds as well as their levels in the za’atar essential oils. All studies extracted essential oil from air- or shade-dried za’atar, except for Fleisher and Fleisher [

 <xref rid="B35-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], where essential oils were obtained from fresh plants. Eight studies used hydro-distillation for essential oil extraction [

 <xref rid="B19-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. All studies used GC-MS for the analyses of essential oil, except for Al-Mariri et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], where they used GC-HPLC. Kouame et al. [
 <xref rid="B36-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] used Carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (13C-NMR) spectrometry besides GC-MS. Quality control is a major challenge in herbal products and supplements [
 <xref rid="B37-plants-10-01001" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In addition to the difference in experimental conditions in obtaining and analyzing za’atar essential oil in studies, the environmental and processing conditions can also affect za’atar essential oil in both quality and quantity aspects.
