<p>Throughout the world, thousands of people are affected by dermatophyte infections which constitute the most common skin diseases. These infections, especially caused by fungal pathogens belonging to 
 <italic>Trichophyton</italic> and 
 <italic>Microsporum</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], are lead to the fourth highest incidence of disease when compared to hundreds of different illnesses and injuries globally [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. On the other hand, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is also considered the most common bacterial cause of skin problems and soft-tissue infections, as well as nosocomial bacteremia, in America and Europe [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], which colonizes in 20â€“30% of the human population [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], as well as livestock and domestic animals [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Another bacterium found in the nasal flora and skin of healthy dogs and cats is 
 <italic>S. pseudointermedius</italic>. This bacterium occasionally infects human skin and soft tissue, leading to pneumonia, brain abscesses, and bacteremia [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> is considered a leading cause of foodborne disease around the globe [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is another bacterium frequently involved in human and animal infections causing diseases with different degrees of severity [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].
