<p>The 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> genus includes about 30 species that grow in South Africa and, despite their use in the folk medicine, there are still only few studies proving their effective biological activity, which were almost exclusively dedicated to in vitro experiments [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Kamatou and Fisher were the only authors who investigated the South African 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> EO, and only six species were the subject of their publications [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In order to contribute to the knowledge on the effect of new EOs, this work provides new insights into the chemical composition of three EOs from South African 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> spp. grown in Italy, 
 <italic>S. aurea</italic> L., 
 <italic>S. dentata</italic> Aiton, and 
 <italic>S. scabra</italic> Thunb., as well as their in vitro antimicrobial and antiviral properties.
