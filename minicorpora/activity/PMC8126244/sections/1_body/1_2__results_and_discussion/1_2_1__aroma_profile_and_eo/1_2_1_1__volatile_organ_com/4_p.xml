<p>Both leaves and flowers of 
 <italic>S. uliginosa</italic> Benth., studied by Giuliani et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], were characterized by a high percentage of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (90.1% and 92.18%, respectively). The most abundant compounds in flowers were biciclogermacrene (31.3%) and β-caryophyllene (25.6%). In the leaves, the above-cited compounds were also present (16.9% and 12.9%, respectively) even though γ-muurolene (31.4%) was the predominant constituent. Analyzing the 
 <italic>S. scabra</italic> leaf aromatic profile, only β-caryophyllene was present in a high percentage (18.4%), while γ-muurolene was present in a reduced amount (0.1%); biciclogermacrene was completely absent.
