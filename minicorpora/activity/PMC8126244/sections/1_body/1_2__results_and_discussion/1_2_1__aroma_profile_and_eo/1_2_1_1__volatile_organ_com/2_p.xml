<p>The spontaneous emission of 
 <italic>S. scabra</italic> leaves was almost exclusively characterized by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (97.8%). This class was mostly represented by germacrene D (32.8%), β-caryophyllene (18.4%), α-copaene (13.5%), and γ-elemene (6.6%). On the contrary, monoterpenes predominated in the VOC leaves of 
 <italic>S. dentata</italic> (oxygenated monoterpenes (47.5%) and monoterpene hydrocarbons (43.8%)). Camphor (22.4%), 1,8-cineole (16.3%), and bornyl acetate (6.8%) were the major OM constituents, while camphene (19.8%), α-pinene (11.8%) and β-pinene (4.9%) were the most abundant MHs. All of these compounds were also present in flowers of the same species. In the leaves of both sages, some common compounds were found, present in extremely variable percentages: myrcene (1.8% in 
 <italic>S. dentata</italic> vs. 0.2% in 
 <italic>S. scabra</italic>), camphor (22.4% in 
 <italic>S. dentata</italic> vs. 0.5% in 
 <italic>S. scabra</italic>), α-copaene (0.3% in 
 <italic>S. dentata</italic> vs. 13.5% in 
 <italic>S. scabra</italic>), and β-caryophyllene (1.6% in 
 <italic>S. dentata</italic> vs. 18.4% in
