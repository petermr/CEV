<p>The aromatic profiles of the flowers and leaves of 
 <italic>S. dentata</italic> and 
 <italic>S. scabra</italic> are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02826-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, and their respective chromatograms are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-02826">Figure S1a</xref>–d (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-02826">Supplementary Materials</xref>). Oxygenated monoterpenes were the main constituents in the flowers of both 
 <italic>S. dentata</italic> and 
 <italic>S. scabra</italic>, (57.9% and 53.1%, respectively), with three compounds found in common: 1,8-cineole (24.7% in 
 <italic>S. dentata</italic> and 14.3% in 
 <italic>S. scabra</italic>), camphor (30.4% in 
 <italic>S. dentata</italic> and 37.0% in 
 <italic>S. scabra</italic>), and bornyl acetate (0.4% in 
 <italic>S. dentata</italic> and 6.8% in 
 <italic>S. scabra</italic>). Interestingly, there was an absence of monoterpene hydrocarbons in the flower VOCs of 
 <italic>S. scabra</italic>, while they represented 40.4% of volatile flower emissions of 
 <italic>S. dentata</italic>, mainly represented by camphene (15.0%), α-pinene (10.7%), and β-pinene (6.4%). 
 <italic>S. scabra</italic> flowers were characterized by a significant percentage of diterpene hydrocarbons (20.4%), of which cembrene (14.4%) and isopimara-9(11),15-diene (6.0%) showed the highest amount, together with oxygenated sesquiterpenes (13.8%), with nuciferol acetate (13.0%) as the most abundant compound.
