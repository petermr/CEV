<p>There are still few studies concerning the flavor profile of South African sage species. In fact, according to the best of our knowledge, no work has reported the spontaneous emissions of 
 <italic>S. dentata</italic> and 
 <italic>S. scabra</italic>. The articles present in the literature, so far, focused on other species. Ascrizzi [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], studying the VOC composition of 
 <italic>S. aurea</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aurita</italic> L.f., evidenced the prevalence of monoterpene hydrocarbons (93.4%) and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (44.4%), respectively. These results disagreed with our findings in 
 <italic>S. dentata</italic>, in which oxygenated monoterpenes prevailed (57.9% in the flowers and 47.5% in the leaves), although a considerable percentage of monoterpene hydrocarbons was observed (greater than 40.0% both in the leaves and in the flowers). On the contrary, the volatile organic compounds of 
 <italic>S. scabra</italic> leaves (97.8% sesquiterpene hydrocarbons) had a similar trend to 
 <italic>S. aurita</italic> [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Myrcene and β-caryophyllene were the most abundant compounds in 
 <italic>S. aurea</italic> (89.5%) and 
 <italic>S. aurita</italic> (17.8%), respectively. Myrcene was present in a reduced percentage only in the leaves of 
 <italic>S. dentata</italic>, while β-caryophyllene was more abundant in 
 <italic>S. scabra</italic>, even though the prevalent compound was germacrene D.
