<p>The same authors [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], 2 years later, showed how the composition, yield, and biological activity of the EO from South African 
 <italic>S. aurea</italic> changed depending on the harvest season. The highest essential oil yield was obtained in September and October. α-Eudesmol (12.9% in December), β-eudesmol (12.7% in December), myrcene (11.5% in November), and α-pinene (11.9% in July) were the main components. The 
 <italic>S. aurea</italic> sample studied herein was collected between May and June 2017, and only α-pinene (1.3%) and myrcene (1.0%) were present in lower percentages. Still analyzing the South African species, van Vuuren [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] confirmed the dominance of β-eudesmol (14.5%) and α-eudesmol (13.5%) in 
 <italic>S. aurea</italic> EO. Other compounds were also present in a high amount such as α-pinene (8.6%), δ-3-carene (7.4%), β-caryophyllene (5.9%), limonene (5.3%), β-phellandrene (5.3%), γ-eudesmol (4.3%), epimanool (3.9%), viridiflorol (3.6%), β-pinene (3.4%), and myrcene (3.3%). Only δ-3-carene was present in almost the same amount in the studied oil. The remaining constituents were present in a lesser percentage or completely absent, such as β-eudesmol, α-eudesmol, β-phellandrene, γ-eudesmol, and epimanool.
