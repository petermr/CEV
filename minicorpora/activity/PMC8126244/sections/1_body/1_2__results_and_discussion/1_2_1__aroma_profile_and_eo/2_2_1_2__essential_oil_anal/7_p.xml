<p>Kamatou [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] examined the EO composition of 
 <italic>S. africana-caerulea</italic> L. and 
 <italic>S. lanceolata</italic> Lam. and found oxygenated sesquiterpenes as the predominant constituents (58.7% and 47.9%, respectively), mostly represented by spatulenol (29.1% and 18.3%, respectively) and caryophyllene oxide (14.0â€“15.0%). This chemical class, although present in all the examined species in consistent percentages (33.5% in 
 <italic>S. aurea</italic>, 29.5% in 
 <italic>S. dentata</italic>, and 15.8% in 
 <italic>S. scabra</italic>), did not predominate in any of them. The highest percentage of caryophyllene oxide was found in 
 <italic>S. aurea</italic> (3.6%) and 
 <italic>S. scabra</italic> (3.4%), while its level in 
 <italic>S. dentata</italic> did not exceed 0.2%. A small percentage of spatulenol, on the other hand, was present only in 
 <italic>S. scabra</italic>.
