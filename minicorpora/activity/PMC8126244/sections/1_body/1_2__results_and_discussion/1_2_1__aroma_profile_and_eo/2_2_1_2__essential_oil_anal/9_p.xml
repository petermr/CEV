 <italic>S. somalensis</italic> Vatke and 
 <italic>S. dolomitica</italic> were characterized by monoterpenes (73.1% in 
 <italic>S. dolomitica</italic> and 67.8% in 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>somalensis</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] as observed in 
 <italic>S. dentata</italic> EO (67.5%). 1,8-Cineole was the main constituent in 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>dolomitica</italic> (18.9%), while bornyl acetate (16.1%) and camphor (12.5%) showed the highest percentages in

 <italic>β</italic>-Caryophyllene (13.1% in 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>dolomitica</italic>) and 
 <italic>δ</italic>-cadinene (6.4% in 
 <italic>S. somalensis</italic>) were the most representative compounds of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. All these compounds were present in different relative amounts in the investigated sages except for bornyl acetate, which was absent in 
 <italic>S. aurea</italic>. Viridiflorol, the main compound of 
 <italic>S. dentata</italic>, was also the main constituent in both 
 <italic>S. africana-caerulea</italic> (36.7%) and
