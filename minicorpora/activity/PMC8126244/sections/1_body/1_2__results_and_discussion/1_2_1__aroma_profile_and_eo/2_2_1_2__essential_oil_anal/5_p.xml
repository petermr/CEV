<p>The same species collected in the Western Cape region of South Africa in the vegetative stage was the subject of a more recent work [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The authors registered a yield of EO very low in comparison with that found herein (0.25% vs. 1.01%) but in agreement with the amount found by Kamatou [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. They also observed that β-eudesmol (12.3%), α-eudesmol (12.4%), terpinene-4-ol (10.1%), and T-cadinol (7.6%) were the majority. This was in contrast with the results of this study, where the EO was eudesmol-free and terpinene-4-ol was of a very less percentage (0.2%).
