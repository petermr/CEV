<p>Contrary to previous results, 
 <italic>S. chameleaeagnea</italic> Berg. stood out for the prevalence of oxygenated monoterpenes (42.8%), particularly 1,8-cineole (40.5%) [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The same trend was observed in 
 <italic>S. dentata</italic>, even though camphor prevailed and 1,8-cineole was present at only 4.1% of the identified fraction. Other researchers [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] investigated the EO profile of another South African species, 
 <italic>S. uliginosa</italic> Benth. and evidenced the dominance of bicyclogermacreme (16.3%), germacrene D (14.8%), and spathulenol (12.7%). Here, only 
 <italic>S. scabra</italic> EO showed a good amount of germacrene D (32.7%). The other two constituents were almost absent in all three studied species.
