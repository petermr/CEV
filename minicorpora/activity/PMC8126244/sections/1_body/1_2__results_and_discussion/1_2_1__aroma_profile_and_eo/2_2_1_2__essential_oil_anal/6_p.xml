<p>To the best of our knowledge, the chemical composition of 
 <italic>S. dentata</italic> and 
 <italic>S. scabra</italic> EOs has never been reported in the literature. However, numerous works investigated the chemical composition of EOs from different South African 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> species. Fisher [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] studied the chemical profile of 
 <italic>S. disermas</italic> L., 
 <italic>S. dolomitica</italic> Codd, and 
 <italic>S. namaensis</italic> Schinz EOs. Linalyl acetate (34.5%) prevailed in the first species, but it was completely absent in all the sages analyzed herein. The second evidenced important percentages of 1,8-cineole (17.6%), β-caryophyllene (17.4%), and limonene (9.7%); all these compounds were found in reduced amounts in our work. The 
 <italic>S. namaensis</italic> EO, instead, presented camphor (33.5%), camphene (14.7%), α-pinene (9.3%), 1,8-cineole (8.2%), and bornyl acetate (6.8%) as predominant compounds [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. All these compounds were observed in 
 <italic>S. dentata</italic>, even though the main component was viridiflorol (27.7%).
