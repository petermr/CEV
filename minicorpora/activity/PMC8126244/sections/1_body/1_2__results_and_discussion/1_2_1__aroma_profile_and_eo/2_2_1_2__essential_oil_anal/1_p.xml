<p>The composition of the investigated EOs from the three sages is shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02826-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, and their representative chromatograms are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-02826">Figure S2</xref> (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-02826">Supplementary Materials</xref>). Overall, 125 compounds were identified, accounting for at least 98.1% of the whole essential oil composition (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02826-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Out of these constituents, only 15 were found in common among the three species: α- and β-pinene, myrcene, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, limonene, δ-3-carene, 1,8-cineol, terpinolene, camphor, α-copaene, β-caryophyllene, α-humulene, δ-cadinene, viridiflorol, and pentacosane. The extraction yield of 
 <italic>S. scabra</italic> oil was very low (0.10%), while that for 
 <italic>S. aurea</italic> and 
 <italic>S. dentata</italic> was quite high (1.01% and 1.53%, respectively). Sesquiterpenes hydrocarbons and oxygenated sesquiterpenes were the predominant classes in both 
 <italic>S. scabra</italic> (76.6% and 15.8%, respectively) and 
 <italic>S. aurea</italic> (41.5% and 33.5%, respectively), which boasted of a good percentage of MHs (17.0%).
