<p>Comparing the current results of the 
 <italic>S. aurea</italic> EO with those reported in the literature, some substantial differences can be noted. First of all, the main compounds changed depending on the use of fresh or dry material. In fact, fresh leaves of 
 <italic>S. aurea</italic> (native from South Africa but grown in Italy), analyzed by Serrato-Valenti [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], pointed out presented (34.7%), δ-3-carene (16.5%), and camphene (8.3%) as the predominant constituents. The oil extracted herein from dry material showed β-caryophyllene (12.5%) and epi-α-cadinol (10.2%) as the most abundant components, although a considerable percentage of δ-3-carene (7.8%) was also noted. Moreover, both camphor and camphene were present, but in extremely low percentages (0.2% and 0.1%, respectively). The dried aerial parts of native South African 
 <italic>S. aurea</italic> EO was characterized by monoterpene hydrocarbons (35.6%), with myrcene as the most abundant constituent (11.5%) [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. These were in total disagreement with our findings, and the myrcene value did not exceed 1.0%.
