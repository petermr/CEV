<p>β-Caryophyllene, a compound shared by different 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> species, also suppressed HSV multiplication by more than 90% [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. An investigation on 
 <italic>Mosla dianthera</italic> EO, which showed a comparable amount of β-caryophyllene, confirmed its safe and effective therapeutic ability for the treatment of influenza and subsequent viral pneumonia [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Recently, Dunkic [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] demonstrated that, in addition to β-caryophyllene content, germacrene D might play an important role in the antiphytoviral activity. These results were in complete disagreement with those found in this work, where, although 
 <italic>S. aurea</italic> contained large amounts of β-caryophyllene, it was completely inactive on the tested virus. Others compounds were found to inhibit virus replication with a dosage below the cytotoxic level, such as terpinen-4-ol, terpinolene, and α-terpineol [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. All of these compounds were present in the analyzed sage samples, except for α-terpineol, which was present only in 
 <italic>S. dentata</italic> EO, in a very low amount; however, this could explain the activity of this latter EO on H1N1 virus.
