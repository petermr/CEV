<p>The investigation on Tunisian sage (S
 <italic>. officinalis</italic> L.), where camphor was one of main compounds (25.14%) as in our 
 <italic>S. dentata</italic> EO, reported an interesting activity of this oil against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Their results disagreed with ours because 
 <italic>S. dentata</italic> EO showed only slight activity. The observed activity of 
 <italic>S. dentata</italic> EO could be due to the presence of both viridiflorol and camphor. Da Silva [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], in fact, demonstrated that viridiflorol, even though in a low amount, was more effective against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, while Gilabert [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] noted an inhibition of about 40% of the growth of human pathogenic bacteria using the same compound (viridiflorol) at 50 µg/mL. Trevizan [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] also showed the in vitro efficacy of the cited component but on 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (MIC = 190.0 μg/mL), and they compared the in vivo anti-inflammatory activity to dexamethasone. This compound was also noted for its potent acetylcholinesterase inhibition [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. A moderate antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>Ferula vesceritensis</italic>, where viridiflorol was one of the main compounds (13.4%), was reported by Benchabne et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].
