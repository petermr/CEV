<p>Observing the results of antiviral activity once again, only the 
 <italic>S. dentata</italic> EO evidenced very good action on H1N1 virus (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02826-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). This oil presented a fair percentage of β-pinene, (3.2%), a compound known to have good anti-HSV activity, as stated by Orhan [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and Astani [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], whereas, α-pinene reduced the infectivity of HSV-1 by &gt;96% [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The cited constituent was present at a highest percentage in the active sage oil (10.2%). Falang carried out an in silico investigation of the plant constituents of some Nigerian medicinal species [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The authors showed that the phytochemical constituents of the selected plants had better binding affinity to several Covid-19 viral target proteins, testing the 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> EO compounds borneol, camphor, and pinene. Thus, this plant was selected among nine others to proceed with in vitro studies. These constituents were almost exclusive to 
 <italic>S. dentata</italic> essential oil and could be responsible for the antiviral action of this oil.
