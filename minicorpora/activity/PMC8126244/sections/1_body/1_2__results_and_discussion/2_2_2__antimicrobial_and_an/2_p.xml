<p>As far as we know, no report is present in the literature on the biological activity of 
 <italic>S. dentata</italic> EO. Only 
 <italic>S. aurea</italic> EO was the subject of a few studies for its biological activity. The first one dates back to 1998 when Bisio and collaborators investigated its antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The authors tested this oil on 13 microorganisms. They found a nonsignificant effect on Gram-positive bacteria, especially 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. These results were confirmed in this work. Later on, Russo tested the oil firstly on human melanoma cells (M14, A2058 and A375) [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and then on prostate cancer [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In both works, the author affirmed the inhibition of growth and an apoptotic effect on all the tested cells.
