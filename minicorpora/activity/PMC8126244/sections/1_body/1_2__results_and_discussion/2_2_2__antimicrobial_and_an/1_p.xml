<p>The examined EOs showed variable antimycotic degree toward the tested fungi (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02826-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The microdilution test showed that only dermatophytes were sensitive to the sage Eos, particularly 
 <italic>S. dentata</italic>. The low quantity of 
 <italic>S. scabra</italic> EO made it impossible to test its antimicrobial and antiviral activity. Noteworthily, 
 <italic>S. dentata</italic> EO demonstrated a good antifungal action on 
 <italic>M. canis</italic> (MIC = 0.5%). The tested oils were not active against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, whereas a low inhibition efficacy of 
 <italic>Salvia dentata</italic> EO was observed on 
 <italic>S. pseudointermedius</italic> (MIC = 10%). Regarding the antiviral activity, only 
 <italic>S. dentata</italic> EO showed very good H1N1 inhibition. On the contrary, 
 <italic>S. aurea</italic> was completely inactive against this virus (
