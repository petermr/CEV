<p>Viridiflorol was also found as the major constituent in Algerian 
 <italic>S. algeriens</italic> Desf. and Iranian 
 <italic>S. sclareopsis</italic> flower (71.1%) and leaf EOs (23.47%). Antifungal activity against 
 <italic>Alternia solani</italic> and 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> was noted using the flower of Algerian sage even though the best effectiveness was observed using the leaf EO (rich in benzaldehyde, eugenol, and phenylethyl) [

 <italic> S. sclareopsis</italic> leaf EO, however, evidenced a high antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. These results confirmed those found here, where the 
 <italic>S. dentata</italic> EO, i.e., that with the highest amount of viridiflorol, was completely inactive on the tested 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> spp.
