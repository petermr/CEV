<p>The native South African

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-02826">Table S1</xref>) are part of the aromatic plant collection of the Research Center for Horticulture of CREA in Sanremo (Italy). The seeds were purchased from specialized companies during a seed sale of plants from the African flora (Silver Hill—PO Box 53108, Kenilworth, 7745 Cape Town, South Africa and B &amp; T World Seeds—Paguignan, 34210 Aigues Vives, France). The plants were grown in pots under the same edaphic and climatic conditions. After clonal propagation, the plants grew in pots in the open air and were watered periodically. Flowering took place after 1 year. Plant samples were deposited in the herbarium of the Hanbury Botanical Gardens (La Mortola-Ventimiglia, Imperia, Italy). The correct identification of the plants was carried out by Claudio Cervelli. The aerial parts were harvested in the flowering period and dried at room temperature for 5 days.
