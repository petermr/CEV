<p>Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, propagated in modified Eagle’s medium (MEM; SIGMA, Milano, Italy) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; SIGMA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (SIGMA), were used for the inhibitory viral plaque reduction assay (PRA). Briefly, six-well plates were seeded with 2.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells in 3 mL of growth medium and kept overnight in incubators at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. On the day of infection, after removal of the growth medium, cell monolayers at 80–90% confluence were infected with 100 mL of influenza virus H1N1 (human pandemic variant A/Firenze/05/2017 H1N1) with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 in the presence or absence (MEM with DMSO alone) of different concentration (from 0.1% to 0.0001%) of each EO diluted in DMSO in a final volume of 0.3 mL and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Then, after a washing step with PBS 1×, the overlay medium composed of 0.5% Sea Plaque Agarose (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) diluted in propagation medium supplemented with 
 <sc>l</sc>-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl-chloromethyl-ketone-treated trypsin (2 mg/mL; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added to each well. After 4 days of incubation at 37 °C, the monolayers were fixed with methanol (Carlo Erba Chemicals, Milan, Italy) and stained with 0.1% crystal violet (Carlo Erba Chemicals), and the viral titers were calculated on the basis of counting plaque-forming units (PFU). The percentage of PRA was calculated by dividing the average PFU of EO-treated samples by the average of untreated samples (viral positive control in the presence of DMSO alone): PRA = 100 − (PFU obtained with EOs at indicated dilution/PFU obtained with DMSO alone) × 100. All experiments were repeated at least twice.
