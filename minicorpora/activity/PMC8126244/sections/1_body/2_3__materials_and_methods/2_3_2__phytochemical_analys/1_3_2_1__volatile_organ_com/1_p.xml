<p>The analysis of volatile organic compounds was performed on fresh plant using the solid-phase microextraction (SPME) method [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. A sample of the fresh aerial parts of each 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> sp. was placed separately in a glass jar, and then sealed with aluminum foil for 30 min (equilibration time) at room temperature (22 ± 1 °C). By the end, the fiber (PDMS, 100 µm) (St. Louis, MO, USA), previously preconditioned according to the manufacturer’s instructions, was exposed to the headspace for 15 min. Once sampling was finished, the fiber was withdrawn into the needle and transferred to the injection port of the GC–MS instrument, where thermal desorbing and component analysis took place. It was not possible to analyze the spontaneous emissions of 
 <italic>S. aurea</italic> because the fresh plant was not available. For the essential oil extraction, the dried aerial parts of each plant were hydrodistilled using the Clevenger apparatus according to the European Pharmacopoeia (EDQM, 2017). The obtained essential oil was kept at a temperature of 4 °C and away from light sources until analysis. A diluted oil, in 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane by HPLC (at 5%), was injected into GC–MS.
