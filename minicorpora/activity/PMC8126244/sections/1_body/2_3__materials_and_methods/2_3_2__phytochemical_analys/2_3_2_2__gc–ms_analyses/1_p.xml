<p>Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) was used to determine VOC and EO components. The gas chromatograph used was an Agilent 7890B (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). The mobile phase was represented by helium (He). The capillary column was an Agilent HP5-MS (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA), of 30 m length and 0.25 mm diameter. The stationary phase was linked to the internal surface of the column via covalent bonds and was stabilized by transverse bonds. The syringe was inserted into the gas chromatograph through the injector, allowing the adsorbent fiber to come out. The splitless method was used for injection; the injected sample was vaporized and transported to the carrier gas column. The temperature at the injector level was 220 °C. The separation column was contained in a thermostatic chamber, in which the starting temperature was 60 °C, increasing by 3 °C per minute up to 240 °C. The detector coupled to the gas chromatograph was an Agilent 5977B single-quadrupole mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA), operating in full scan mode (1 scan/s), in the range 30–300
