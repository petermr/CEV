<p>The MIC value (minimum inhibitory concentration) was determined by the broth microdilution method following the protocol previously reported [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-26-02826" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In brief, an EO stock solution was prepared by adding 40 µL of each oil to 360 µL of BHI (Brain Heart Infusion) broth. The test involved the preparation of a series of decreasing scalar dilutions (halved) of the antimicrobial agent, to which the same amount of BHI was added. In each well of a 96-well sterile microplate, 95 µL of BHI was added to 95 µL of the stock solution (10% solution). Then, 5 µL of each bacterial suspension was inoculated into each well. The test was performed in a total volume of 100 µL with final EO concentrations of 10% to 0.5%. The same assay was performed simultaneously for microorganism growth control (tested agents and media) and sterility control (tested oil and media). All tests were performed in triplicate, with chloramphenicol (Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, UK) as a positive control.
