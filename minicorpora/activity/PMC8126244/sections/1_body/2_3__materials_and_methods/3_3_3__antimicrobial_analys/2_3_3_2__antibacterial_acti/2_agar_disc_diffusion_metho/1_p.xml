<p>The agar disc diffusion method was executed following the procedures described by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [

Briefly, 9 cm diameter petri dishes containing Muller–Hinton medium were sown, through the use of a swab, with the bacterial strain in order to obtain uniform bacterial growth. Sterile cellulose 6 mm discs soaked in a solution (10%
