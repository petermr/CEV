<p>The volatile emissions of 
 <italic>S. dentata</italic> and 
 <italic>S. scabra</italic>, as well as the EO composition of the cited species, together with 
 <italic>S. aurea</italic> (South Africa sages), were investigated. The chemical profiles of the first two species were reported here for the first time. The EOs obtained in good amounts were tested for antifungal, antibacterial, and antiviral activity. It is worthy to note that the effect of 
 <italic>S. dentata</italic> essential oil was startling and showed a fair to good activity on the tested pathogens. These plants were introduced in Italy for ornamental purposes by CREA-OF (Sanremo); however, according to these encouraging biological activities, the EO of 
 <italic>S. dentata</italic> deserves deep investigation and could exhibit interesting new perspectives for medicinal and industrial uses. The 
 <italic>S. sclarea</italic> EO presented compounds previously known for their good antiviral activity; therefore, the use of another extraction method would be interesting to increase its EO yield in order to verify this potential.
