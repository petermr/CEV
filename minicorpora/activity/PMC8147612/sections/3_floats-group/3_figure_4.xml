  <p>Morphological characteristics of zebrafish embryos and larvae treated with different concentrations of ZO essential oil or vehicle at different time points (24–120 hpf). Normal morphology was found in the group treated with the lowest concentrations and with vehicle (
   <bold>E</bold>,
   <bold>F</bold>). Typical malformations of zebrafish development were observed in embryos that had received ZO essential oil at a dose of 0.49–3.91 µg/mL (
   <bold>A</bold>–
   <bold>D</bold>). Abbreviations: PE, pericardial sac edema; C, coagulation; DT, dented tail; PY, poor reabsorption of yolk sac; MY, malformation of yolk sac; SC, spinal curvature.
