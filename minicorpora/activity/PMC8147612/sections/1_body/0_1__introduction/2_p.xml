 <italic>Danio rerio</italic>, commonly called zebrafish, is a small tropical freshwater fish in the Cyprinidae family. In recent times, animal models using zebrafish are becoming popular and reliable models widely used in biological researches such as in the fields of genetic development, transgenesis, and toxicology [

The egg of zebrafish was transparent, which allows the direct observation of developmental stages (from fertilization, embryogenesis, and organogenesis to larva hatching) and assessment of endpoint morphological changes in toxicity studies [

Moreover, animal models using zebrafish have many advantages including low husbandry cost, requiring small housing spaces, having a small number of chemical compounds and test drugs, short breeding cycle (5–7 days) and higher fecundity (with 200–300 eggs per one pair of adult fish), and are suitable for high throughput screening. These benefits of the zebrafish model are the reasons for the popularity of using these models as alternative models, in comparison to some vertebrate toxicity assessment models [
