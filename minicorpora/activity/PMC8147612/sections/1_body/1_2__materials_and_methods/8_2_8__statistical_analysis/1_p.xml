<p>In zebrafish embryotoxicity and teratogenicity tests, the experiments were conducted with three independent replications. The mortality of zebrafish embryos and teratogenicity test results were compared by means of one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s multiple comparison test. Student’s 
 <italic>t</italic>-test was used for comparisons between two experimental groups in the acute oral toxicity study using SPSS Statistical Package version 22 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical significance of differences was set at 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. Differences between the five groups in rates of time to outcome were compared using the Kaplan–Meier curve, and the log-rank test for significance and statistical analysis of LC
 <sub>50</sub> was calculated using GraphPad Prism8 Software (San Diego, CA, USA).
