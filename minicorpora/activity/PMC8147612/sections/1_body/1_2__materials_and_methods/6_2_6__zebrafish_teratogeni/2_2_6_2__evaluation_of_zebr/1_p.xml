<p>The hatchability of the zebrafish embryos treated with different concentrations of ZO essential oil (0–3.91 µg/mL) was determined between 48 and 120 hpf using a stereomicroscope. The hatching success of embryos was determined by chorion rupture releasing the larvae into the embryo water. Hatchability rates were determined by comparing the number of hatched embryos with the total number of embryos tested.</p>
