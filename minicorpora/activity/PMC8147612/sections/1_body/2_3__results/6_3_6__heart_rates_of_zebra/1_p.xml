 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxics-09-00102-f005">Figure 5</xref>B. There was no significant difference between the means of the heart rates of the ZO essential oil (0.24 µg/mL)-treated group and the 0.1% DMSO-treated group (control). The average heart rate declined at higher concentrations. No heartbeat was detected at 72 hpf in any zebrafish embryos treated with 3.91 µg/mL of ZO essential oil due to embryo death.
