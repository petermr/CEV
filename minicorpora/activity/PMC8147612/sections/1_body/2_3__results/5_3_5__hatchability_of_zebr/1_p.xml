<p>The hatching of zebrafish embryos indicates successful embryonic development of the embryos after 48 hpf [
 <xref rid="B28-toxics-09-00102" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The hatching rates of zebrafish embryos treated with five different concentrations of ZO essential oil (3.91, 1.95, 0.98, 0.49, and 0.24 µg/mL) and 0.1% DMSO (control) are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxics-09-00102-f005">Figure 5</xref>A. As the concentration increased, the hatching rate of treated embryos became lower. No hatching of any zebrafish embryos was observed in the 3.91 and 1.95 µg/mL treated groups. All of the zebrafish embryos treated with 0.24 µg/mL of the ZO essential oil or vehicle were successfully hatched.
