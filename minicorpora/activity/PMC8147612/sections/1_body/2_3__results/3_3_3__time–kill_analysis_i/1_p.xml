<p>Time–kill analysis of five different concentrations of ZO essential oil in a series of twofold dilution concentrations over the range of 0.24–3.91 µg/mL was conducted to evaluate the kinetic killing in zebrafish embryos over the course of 24–120 hpf. The Kaplan–Meier curve was used to display the relationship between time (hpf) to zebrafish embryo death (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxics-09-00102-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The results showed that the killing potency of ZO essential oil appeared to occur in a time-dependent manner. The survival rate of zebrafish embryos treated with the lowest dose of ZO essential oil or with 0.1% DMSO (control) was 1.00. On the other hand, the survival rates of zebrafish embryos treated with 0.49 and 0.98 µg/mL of ZO essential oil were reduced to 0.72 and 0.33 at 120 hpf, respectively. Interestingly, the survival rates of zebrafish embryos treated with 3.91 and 1.95 µg/mL were decreased to zero at 72 and 96 hpf, respectively (log-rank test,
