<p>The demand for bioactive molecules or bioactive agent-loaded nano-constructs with desirable properties has increased in the past few years [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-26-02880" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], as an alternative and robust choice to minimize the extensive use of synthetic drugs. Therefore, carriers of bioactive molecules or drug-loaded constructs must be able to retain their contents until reaching target sites in the body [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-26-02880" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A functional approach to perform efficient delivery with target specificity and controlled release is the use of nanomaterials (e.g., nanofibers, nanogels, micelles, nanoparticles, nanoliposomes, etc.). Among these nanomaterials, nanoliposomes represent the most used phospholipid-based nanocarrier for drug delivery applications [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-02880" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Nanoliposomes are bilayer structures that maintain their nanometric size within the range of 20 to 150 nm, during storage and applications. Additionally, their lipid and aqueous composition allow the entrapment of hydrophobic and hydrophilic agents, either individually or simultaneously [

 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-02880" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, classifications by the number of layers and size are most commonly used [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-26-02880" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], such as, SUV: small unilamellar vesicles (20–50 nm); LUV: large unilamellar vesicles (&gt;560 nm); MLV: multilamellar vesicles (170–5000 nm); OLV: oligolamellar vesicles; MUV: medium unilamellar vesicles (unilamellar vesicles; &gt;100 nm); GUV: giant unilamellar vesicles (cell size vesicles with diameters &gt;1 mm). In unilamellar structures, the vesicle has a single phospholipid bilayer sphere enclosing the aqueous solution. In multilamellar liposomes, vesicles have an onion structure. Classically, several unilamellar vesicles will form on the inside of those with a smaller size, making a multilamellar structure of concentric phospholipid spheres separated by layers of water [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-02880" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Overall, nanoliposomes have an affinity to the biological membrane, which facilitates their cellular absorption. In addition, they are non-toxic, biodegradable, biocompatible, and can be prepared using natural ingredients (e.g., egg yolk, soybean lecithin, sunflower oil, etc.) [
