<p>In this regard, incorporation of EOs into nanoliposomes holds a great strategy to improve bioavailability, minimize toxicity, and prevent the degradation of EOs for therapeutical proposes [

Additionally, a comparison study between OEO in bulk and encapsulated into nanoliposomes was performed by testing the mycelial growth inhibition (MGI) to measure their effectiveness against fungal strains of
