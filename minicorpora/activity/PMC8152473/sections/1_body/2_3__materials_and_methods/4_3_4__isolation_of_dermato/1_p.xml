<p>A fungal strain provided by the Department of Biological Sciences of Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon was used to isolate and reseed 
 <italic>Trichophyton rubrum</italic> species. Briefly, 5.85 g potato dextrose agar (PDA) was diluted in 150 mL of double-distilled water under magnetic stirring. The sample was poured into a flask and sterilized at 121 °C for 1 h and 45 min in the autoclave. Subsequently, the flask was transferred to the laminar flow hood previously sprayed with ethanol solution at 70%. The flask with the PDA solution and a set of Petri dishes were kept in the laminar flow hood under UV light for 15 min. The Petri dishes were filled up to three-quarters of their capacity with the medium and placed under UV light to avoid contamination during agar solidification for 15 min, and then were incubated at 29 °C for 24 h to confirm the inexistence of pollution in the medium. Finally, two sections of the fungal strain were transferred to the medium and incubated at 29 °C for 1 week.
