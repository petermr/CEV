<p>Contact effects of EOs with loaded nanoliposomes and unloaded nanoliposomes on the mycelial growth of 
 <italic>T. rubrum</italic> were assessed in vitro using the agar dilution method [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-02880" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The nanoliposome solutions and control samples were dispersed as an emulsion in sterile PDA containing 1% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) Tween-80
 <sup>®</sup> immediately before pouring it into glass Petri dishes (8 cm diameter) at a temperature of 40–55°C. The dilutions tested were 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 μL/mL. Control plates received the same quantity of Tween-80
 <sup>®</sup> mixed with PDA. A 5 mm diameter disc containing 
 <italic>T. rubrum</italic> was taken from the edge of 7-day-old fungal culture and placed in the center of each plate. After incubation at 25 °C for 3 days, treatment efficacy was determined by measuring the average of two perpendicular diameters through each colony. The percentage inhibition of MGI was calculated according to Equation (2) from mean values of colony diameter in treated and control Petri dishes. 
 <disp-formula>MGI % = [(
  <italic>dc</italic> − 
  <italic>dt</italic>)/
  <italic>dc</italic>] × 100 
  <label>(2)</label>
 </disp-formula> where 
 <italic>dc</italic> (cm) is equivalent to the mean colony diameter for the control sets, and 
 <italic>dt</italic> (cm) is equal to the colony diameter for the treatment sets. Each analysis was performed in triplicate.
