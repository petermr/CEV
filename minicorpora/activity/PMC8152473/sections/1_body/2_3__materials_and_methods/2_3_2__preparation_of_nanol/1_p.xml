<p>The thin film hydration–sonication method was used to carry out the synthesis of nanoliposomes. Briefly, a stock solution of 160 mL at 15 mM was prepared using the lipid components, i.e., SBL and Chol in a 5:1 ratio and dissolved in chloroform. Aliquots of 10 mL were taken and dissolved with the essential oil at different concentrations: 6.2, 4.9, 3.7, 2.5 and 1.2 mM (

The solvent was removed using a rotary evaporator above the 60 °C transition temperature of the lipid at 150 rpm, and a high vacuum, which resulted in a uniform thin lipid membrane on the vessel wall. Traces of organic solvents were removed under vacuum for 1 h, and then by storage of the samples for 24 h in a desiccator. The deposited lipid membrane was hydrated with 20 mL of PBS solution, pH 7.4, containing 1% Tween 80, and by agitation for 30 min at 60 °C. Simultaneously, sonication of the preparation was performed by using a sonicator probe with 60% amplitude of sonication for 10 min with 20 s ON and 20 s OFF intervals to avoid heating and to form small unilamellar vesicles. Finally, the liposomal dispersions were stored at 4 °C for 1 month.
