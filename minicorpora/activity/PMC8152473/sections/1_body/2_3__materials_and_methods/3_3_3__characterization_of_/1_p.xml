<p>Characterization of nanoliposomes was performed by measuring the vesicle size and surface charge using the dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique. The morphological characterization was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The chemical interactions between the phenolic compounds from essential oils and nanoliposomes were evaluated by attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). Afterwards, the evaluation of nanoliposomesâ€™ in vitro antifungal activity was assessed against fungal strains of
