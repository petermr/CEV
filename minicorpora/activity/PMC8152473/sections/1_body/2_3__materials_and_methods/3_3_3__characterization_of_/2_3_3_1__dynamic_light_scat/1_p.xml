<p>Average particle size, zeta potential, and polydispersity index were measured by integrated dynamic light scattering with a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Panalytical Instruments, Malvern, WR14 1XZ, United Kingdom) at 25 °C for a duration of 60 s. Data were analyzed using MALVERN software. To avoid multiple scattering, 200 µL of the samples was diluted (5:2) with a PBS solution and placed in a disposable polystyrene cuvette DTS0012. For measurements of the zeta potential, the samples were correspondingly diluted with PBS solution and transferred to a Universal Dip Cell (ZEN 1002). The measurements were performed the 1st day, 1st week, and 1st month after preparation by triplicate for each sample.</p>
