<p>Attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) was performed using a spectrophotometer (Frontier IR Single-Range Systems Perkin Elmer, UK) equipment. The formulations were collected by centrifuge at 15,200 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C and washed 3 times with double-distilled water to remove the salts and then lyophilized overnight. The measurements were performed at wavenumber: 4000 to 400 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, 16 scans; resolution: 2 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>; speed: 0.50 cm/s; and force gauge: 100. SBL, Chol and Tween 80
 <sup>®</sup> were also analyzed to better understand the vibrations of each compound separately and confirm the incorporation of OEO into nanoliposomes.
