<p>The morphology of the nanoliposomes was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (ZEISS EVO
 <sup>®</sup> MA 25, Ostalbkreis, Baden-Württemberg, Germany) at EHT: 15.00 kV. To confirm the spherical shape of the prepared nanoliposomes, samples containing OEO and empty nanoliposomes were pre-frozen at −80 °C for 24 h and then lyophilized under vacuum. Finally, the samples were coated with gold in a sputter coater under an Ar atmosphere (50 Pa) at 50 mA for 50 s.
