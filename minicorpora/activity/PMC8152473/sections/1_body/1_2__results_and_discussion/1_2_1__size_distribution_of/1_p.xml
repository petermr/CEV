<p>Particle size is one of the most influencing factors guiding the behavior of nanomaterials, stability, release profiles, biological distribution, and cellular uptake. It has been stated that decreasing the size of nanoliposomes promotes their permeation through intercellular paths [

Additionally, the polydispersity index (PdI) of lipid-based nanovesicles may affect their stability and is considered a key factor in particle size distribution. PdI values can range from 0 to 1.0 for an adequately monodisperse and polydisperse nanovesicle, respectively [
