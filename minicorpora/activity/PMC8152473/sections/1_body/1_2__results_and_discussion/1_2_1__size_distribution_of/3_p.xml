<p>The main components of OEO are terpenes, generally mono and sesquiterpenes, with carvacrol, thymol, γ-terpinene, and p-cymene some of the main constituents [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-02880" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. It has been reported that small terpenes can decrease the size of lipid nanocarriers by compelling the phosphatidylcholine structure to increase its surface curvature [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-02880" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For OEO nanoliposomes, PdI values were lower than 0.5 in all cases, indicating a monodisperse system. Several literature reports related to the encapsulation of EOs into nanoliposomes, for instance, pistachio oil (100–250 nm) and PdI (0.1–0.5) [

 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-02880" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and Zataria multiflora oil (97.8–210 nm) and PdI (0.172–0.424) [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-02880" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] are close to the obtained results in this work. In this regard, the size of OEO nanoliposomes meets the conditions specified for pharmaceutical and other delivery applications.
