<p>For the case of OEO-loaded nanoliposomes, the smallest particle size was obtained at higher concentrations of OEO, labeled as F1 OEO (79.63 ± 0.92 nm at 6.2 mM). During the first measurement and after 1 week of storage, F1 OEO kept the smallest particle size, as shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02880-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. However, after 1 month, its particle size increased and was the largest particle size compared to the rest of the formulations. Changes in the particle size of nanoliposomes are attributed to the small average particle size. The smaller the particle size, the higher the surface area, and the strong attractive interaction between particles derived the aggregation agglomeration [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02880-f001">Figure 1</xref>A–C. The nanoliposome formulations were bigger in size during the first measurement with respect to the control sample. However, after 1 week and 1 month, the control vesicle (empty nanoliposome) exhibited the highest particle size with respect to the rest of the formulations loaded with OEO. Lipid composition and encapsulated compounds affect the size of nanoliposomes. In this regard, the bulk of nanoliposomes would be larger in the case of the addition of compounds such as cholesterol [
