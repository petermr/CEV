<p>Zeta potential measurement is a common practice to determine the surface charge of colloidal systems, repulsion forces between them, and their physical stability [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-26-02880" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Hence, the stability of nanoliposomes directly increases the increase in the repulsion of particles by either the electrostatic or steric repulsion of vesicles [

 <xref rid="B30-molecules-26-02880" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Nanoliposome formulations loaded with OEO presented zeta potential values in the range of −36.94 ± 0.36 mV, higher compared to the control samples, which exhibited values from −15.54 ± 1.49 mV to −8.66 ± 1.43 mV (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02880-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The sign and magnitude of zeta potential was determined by the net charge accumulated on the nanoliposome surface. OEO nanoliposomes exhibited negative zeta potential values. These results may be attributed, on one hand, to the choline head present in the phosphatidylcholine group of soybean lecithin [

 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-02880" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], its polar head can reorient depending on the temperature ionic strength. At a low ionic strength, the choline groups are located below the phosphate group (negative zeta potential), whereas at a high ionic strength, the situation is reversed. Moreover, a 1 X PBS solution at pH 7.4 was used during the hydration process which involved anionic species, and their dissociation equilibria involved multivalent anions which may lead to negative zeta potential values [
