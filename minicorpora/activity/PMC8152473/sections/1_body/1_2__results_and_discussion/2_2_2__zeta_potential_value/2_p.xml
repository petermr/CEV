<p>It was observed that zeta potential values were higher at lower OEO concentrations in all the measurements performed. However, all the formulations reached lower zeta potential values after 1 month of storage, such as the case of formulation F3 OEO (−6.62 ± 0.75 mV). A decrease in zeta potential is associated to small particle size, large surface area, and free energy of nanoparticles. If zeta potential values are low, attraction overcomes repulsion in order to minimize the energy, and the mixture forms aggregates [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02880-f002">Figure 2</xref>. This phenomenon has previously been reported by [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-26-02880" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and can be attributed to the sonication energy introduced into the system during preparation, resulting in coalescence or aggregation during storage. Therefore, there was not a significant contribution of Tween-80
 <sup>®</sup> in the stability of nanoliposomes under storage. However, further studies could be performed in the future, varying the amount of surfactant at different concentrations of OEO.
