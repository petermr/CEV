<p>The FTIR spectra of OEO, empty nanoliposomes, OEO-loaded nanoliposomes, and phospholipid constituents were obtained and are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02880-f004">Figure 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02880-f005">Figure 5</xref>. Nanoliposome samples loaded with OEO presented vibrations at 2924 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C–H) stretching alkane, 2855 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C–H) stretching alkane, 1740 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C=O) stretching aldehyde, 1464 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C–H) bending alkane, and 1059 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C–O) stretching primary alcohol. The FTIR spectrum of pure OEO exhibited a high number of vibrations related to the volatile compounds, and the bands at 2964 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C–H) stretching alkane and 1425 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C–H) bending alkane, this latter related to the methyl group, showed a shift in the nanoliposome formulation containing OEO, which can be attributed to the stretching vibration of the C–H groups and the possible overlapping between bands due to the change in the strength of molecular interactions [

 <xref rid="B40-molecules-26-02880" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The empty nanoliposome revealed vibrations at 2919 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C–H), and 2845 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C–H) related to stretching alkanes, 1741 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C=O) stretching esters, 1460 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C–H) bending alkane related to methylene groups, 1053 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C–O) stretching primary alcohol, and 993 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C=C) bending alkene monosubstituted, indicating an increase in stability of alkenes due to the substitution of hydrogen for carbon [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-26-02880" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. These results showed the appropriate incorporation of OEO into the phospholipid matrix.
