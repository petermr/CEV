<p>Entrapment efficiency percentage (EE%) is an important index to determine the capability of nanosystems in preserving and stabilizing the encapsulated compounds [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-26-02880" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In this study, the EE% test revealed that the set of OEO-loaded nanoliposomes reached values up to 79.55 Â± 6.9% (see 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02880-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). It can be observed that the EE% had slight variance after 30 days, and the percentage values were affected directly by the concentration of OEO, as presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02880-f006">Figure 6</xref>. The EE% values are summarized in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02880-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> for the set of loaded and empty nanoliposome formulations tested 1 and 30 days after the synthesis process. It was observed that the highest EE% values were obtained at higher concentrations of OEO, this may be attributed firstly due to the incorporation of cholesterol during preparation which decreases its permeability and favors encapsulation by decreasing the flexibility of the surrounding lipid chains [

 <xref rid="B43-molecules-26-02880" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], reporting that better incorporation of EOs into nanoliposomes membranes is given by the interaction of the hydroxyl groups present in EOs with the membrane components of nanoliposomes (e.g., cholesterol, soybean lecithin, etc.); in this case, the hydroxyl groups act as hydrogen bond donors, and the phosphate head groups of phospholipids act as hydrogen bond acceptors [
