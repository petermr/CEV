<p>These results state the effectiveness of encapsulation of EOs into nanoliposomes to increase the antifungal activity against 
 <italic>T. rubrum</italic> strains. Remarkably, it is interesting that even at the lowest concentrations of EO (0.25 µL/mL), the inhibition (28.13 ± 1.72%) values were higher than the control nanoliposomes (20.9 ± 1.51%) encapsulated into nanoliposomes, and there was an increase in %MGI in all the formulations compared to the EOs in bulk.
