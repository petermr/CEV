<p>In this study, OEO oils loaded into nanoliposomes were tested against fungal strains of 
 <italic>T. rubrum</italic> by using the agar dilution method [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-26-02880" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. With respect to the prepared nanoliposome formulations, it was found that OEO nanoliposomes reached %MGI values in the range of 81.66 ± 0.86% at 1.5 µL/mL (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02880-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Additionally, pure EO (OEO) in bulk was used as a positive control to observe if there was an improvement in antifungal activity after the encapsulation process. The highest %MGI of OEO in bulk was 40.1 ± 2.16% at 1.5 µL/mL concentration. This is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02880-f007">Figure 7</xref>, thus confirming that %MGI values of OEO nanoliposomes were higher than their respective positive controls at all concentrations.
