  <p>Cytotoxic activity of 
   <italic>E. intisy</italic> essential oil on leukemia HL-60, HL-60R, and differentiated Caco-2 cell lines. Cells were exposed to EO for 72 h, at different concentrations and viability was assessed by MTS assay. Data are expressed as mean ± standard error of three experiments performed in triplicate. Different letters represent significant differences (Tukey’s test) in cytotoxic activity among the concentrations of each cell line (
