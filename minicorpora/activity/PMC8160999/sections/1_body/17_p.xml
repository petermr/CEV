<p>In another study, Grigore-Gurgu et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-biomolecules-11-00768" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] used microencapsulation to enhance the biological properties of two bioactive components (flavonoids and peptides) in a single formulation. They microencapsulated flavonoids extracted from yellow onion skin using papain-hydrolysed peptides extracted from bone tissue from phytophagous carp (
 <italic>Hypophthalmichthys molitrix</italic>). The peptides contained some specific binding sites for flavonoids and revealed the involvement of hydrogen bonds and weak van der Waal interactions in microcapsule formulation. These hydrolyzed proteins improved the encapsulation efficiency of flavonoids. The microencapsulated samples exhibited no sign of cytotoxicity in a cell culture model.
