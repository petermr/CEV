<p>On the other hand, Chaudhary et al. [
 <xref rid="B4-biomolecules-11-00768" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] produced natural polymers with enhanced moisture absorption/retention properties, which were proved to aid in the conditioning of soil and improvement in the soil health, specifically in water deficient areas. The authors formulated agarâ€“agar (Agr) and gelatin (GE) copolymerized methyl acrylate (MA) and acrylic acid (AA) hydrogels (Agr/GE-co-MA/AA) by utilizing microwave-assisted green synthesis. By using Agr/GE-co-MA/AA hydrogels as moisture retaining agents, the water holding time was prolonged from 10 to 30 days for soil and 6 to 10 days for sand. This study showed that novel moisture retaining agents for soil, which are biodegradable, non-toxic, and of low-cost may be developed and applied in areas where water scarcity occurs.
