<p>Polysaccharide microgels loaded with ellagic acid were developed by Alhakamy et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-biomolecules-11-00768" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] to enhance its controlled release in the alimentary tract to treat peptic ulcers. The ellagic acid-loaded microgels, which were formed from calcium pectinate, were shown to significantly improve the gastric ulcer index in rats when compared with native ellagic acid.
