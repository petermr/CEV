<p>Many compounds from the plant have been isolated, characterized, and evaluated for their fungicidal or fungistatic properties, which are more systemic, less phytotoxic, and more eco-friendly. Focal antifungal constituents identified and isolated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02933-f002">Figure 2</xref>) from the plant are precocene II, coumarin, Î²-caryophyllene, and eugenol, whose broad spectrum fungitoxic behavior is marked by an immense literature (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02933-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). However, the results of the studies in the context of their constituent composition and antifungal activity are greatly influenced by (a) geo-ecological variations, i.e., altitude, latitude, and average temperatures; (b) the part of the plant that is used, such as the whole plant, inflorescence, roots, shoots, or leaves; (c) the time of collecting sample (January, April, December, September) or post-harvest; (d) extract type/solvent taken (essential oil, semisolid, dried/ethanol, aqueous, acetone, ether, or dichloromethane fractions etc.); and (e) the fungal strain chosen for the investigation [
