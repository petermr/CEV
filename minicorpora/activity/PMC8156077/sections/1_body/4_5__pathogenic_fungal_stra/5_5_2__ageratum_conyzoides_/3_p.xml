<p>The literature documents a few but very convincing reports stating the antifungal activity of 
 <italic>A. conyzoides</italic> extracts against fusarium species. Rai and Acharya [
 <xref rid="B110-molecules-26-02933" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>] screened 11 species of the plants belonging to the family Asteraceae for their antimycotic potential using the disc diffusion technique and listed 
 <italic>A. conyzoides</italic> within those reported to effectively inhibit mycelia growth of 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporium</italic>. However, the higher positions were occupied by various other oils obtained from the other plants of same family, such as 
 <italic>Tagetes erecta</italic> and 
 <italic>T. patula</italic>. Adekunle [
 <xref rid="B111-molecules-26-02933" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>] stated that ethanolic 
 <italic>A. conyzoides</italic> extracts efficiently inhibited all the eight fungi tested, including 
 <italic>Fusarium solani</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, in comparison with nine other plant extracts examined. Aqueous counterparts of the extracts were also studied against the ethanolic ones but were found to be less effective. Sidra and Uzma [
 <xref rid="B112-molecules-26-02933" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>] evaluated 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, methanolic, and aqueous extracts of the different parts of the weed 
 <italic>A. conyzoides</italic> (root, leaf, stem, and inflorescence) against 
 <italic>Fusarium solani</italic> Mart. (Sacc.), isolated from the roots of eggplant. When fungus was exposed to varying concentrations (2, 4, and 6% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) of different extracts, its growth was reported significantly suppressed. For control over fungal biomass, the observed order of activity followed for the plant part used was leaf &gt; inflorescence &gt; stem &gt; root, and for the solvents it was 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane &gt; methanolic &gt; aqueous. The study demonstrated that all plant parts had great allelopathic potential and extracts were fungitoxic to the wilt pathogen 
 <italic>F. solani</italic>. This ability of different extracts to effectively reduce fungal biomass growth shows that they can be used in the management of various diseases. Later, the study of Ilondu [
 <xref rid="B113-molecules-26-02933" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>] was also in line with the earlier findings of Sidra and Uzma [
 <xref rid="B112-molecules-26-02933" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Varying concentrations (8â€“120 mg/mL) of ethanolic leaf extract of the plant 
 <italic>A. conyzoides</italic> were evaluated for their antifungal activity against leaf spot fungi, 
 <italic>Fusarium lateritium</italic>, 
 <italic>F. Solani</italic>, and 
 <italic>Cochliobolus lunatus</italic> by using the poisoned food method. The phytochemical analysis of the extract showed the presence of terpenes and alkaloid in moderate concentration, which may be attributed to the fungicidal effect of the plant. Inhibition potential of the extracts was significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and concentration dependent. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), where no fungal growth was reported, were 120, 80, and 88 mg/mL for 
 <italic>F. lateritum</italic>, 
 <italic>F. solani</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. lunatus</italic>, respectively. These results are encouraging steps toward the development of natural and less expensive fungicides for the management of several diseases caused by Fusarium species.
