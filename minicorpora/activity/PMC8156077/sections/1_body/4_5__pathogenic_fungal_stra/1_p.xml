<p>Fungal diseases are a global problem and are regarded as a considerable threat not only to humans but also to vegetation growth and storage, rendering foodstuffs inappropriate for human intake by retarding their nutritional value and at times by releasing mycotoxins. 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic>, 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> are some genera guilty of producing the most concerning toxins of major field crops, including oilseeds and cereals. These mycotoxins such as aflatoxin B
 <sub>1</sub>, ochratoxin A, and fumonisin B
 <sub>1</sub>, are liable to affect humans and animal health adversely by encouraging teratogenicity, mutagenicity, and hepatotoxicity, resulting in oedema, immunosuppression, hepatitis, hemorrhage, hepatic carcinoma, kidney failure, and esophageal cancer [

 <italic>Ageratum</italic> holds a distinct place among the natural resources being exploited for their antifungal properties because of the presence of an extensive range of secondary metabolites such as flavonoids, chromenes, chromones, coumarin, benzofurans, terpenoids, steroids, and alkaloids. The plant is capable of demonstrating its pesticidal, fumigant, antifungal, and antimicrobial properties, making it a noteworthy substitute for current pathogen-regulating measures. A substantial literature favors the plant by providing the experimental rationale in support of the antifungal activities associated with this invasive plant [
