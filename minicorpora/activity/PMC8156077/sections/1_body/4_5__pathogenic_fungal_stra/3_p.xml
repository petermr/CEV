<p>Various extracts and essential oils obtained from the plant have been reported to possess their action against pathological strains either by destroying fungal cells or by preventing cell growth and reproduction. Together, these constituents are also capable of obstructing the release of mycotoxins, including various sorts of aflatoxins. Inferences of various studies affirming the antifungal activities related to the plant are conferred below, validating the astute use of 
 <italic>A. conyzoides</italic> in the biological management of plant and animal pathogenic fungi. In addition, this is the first review of this kind where effort has been put forth to aggregate investigations conducted on the plant concerning its antifungal prospects and toxicological standing.
