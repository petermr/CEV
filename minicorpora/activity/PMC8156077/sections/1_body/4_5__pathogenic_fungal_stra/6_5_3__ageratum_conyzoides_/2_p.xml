<p>Hoffman et al. [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-26-02933" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] found 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extracts of 
 <italic>Ageratum</italic> remarkably active against both of the tested fungi: 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>A. fumigatus.</italic> Their zones of inhibition were observed to be 25.4 mm and 42.1 mm, respectively, similarly competent to the standard antibiotic counterpart, fluconazole. Later, the search for inexpensive and non-resistant antifungals led Osho and Adetunji [
 <xref rid="B85-molecules-26-02933" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] to inspect the essential oil of 
 <italic>A. conyzoides</italic> stem, leaves, and roots parts for their antimicrobial activities. The sensitivity of 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species (
 <italic>C. glabrata</italic>, 
 <italic>C. stellatoidea</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>) was determined through the well diffusion procedure and MIC. At 10 μL/mL concentration, essential oil from 
 <italic>A. conyzoides</italic> leaves was found most effective against the tested fungus, 
 <italic>Candida stellatoidea</italic> (19 ± 0.4 mm inhibition zone), whereas essential oil from the stems expressed little or no activity against 
 <italic>C. glabrata</italic>. Minimum inhibitory concentrations ranged from 2 mg/mL to 4 mg/mL, suggesting the use of the plant in controlling infections caused by the tested strains of 
 <italic>Candida</italic> (
 <italic>C. stellatoidea</italic>). Recently, Khastini et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-26-02933" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] assessed the aqueous and ethanolic extracts obtained from the maceration of 
 <italic>Ageratum</italic> leaves for their antifungal activity, together with chemical composition screening and percentage yield calculation. Individual extracts evaluated by the disk diffusion technique were found to inhibit the 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> growth significantly because of the presence of various secondary metabolites in the extracts, such as flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins, steroids, and saponins and offered the same minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 80 mg/mL. However, the diameter of inhibition zone was different: 1.59 mm and 1.55 mm for ethanolic and water fractions, respectively. Results confirmed that both the extracts were comparatively weaker fungicides than the ketoconazole that was used as a positive control. Various fungal strains suppressed by the selected plant extracts or oils are depicted in
