<p>Formerly, when the toxicity-related investigations started for precocene II, this chemical constituent was prepared in the lab. Stephen Hsia et al. [
 <xref rid="B139-molecules-26-02933" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>] investigated the hepatotoxic effect of chemically synthesized precocene II in male SD rats and elucidated the mechanism(s) of precocene-induced pathological lesions. Acute i.p. dosing introduced severe necrosis of parenchymal cells of hepatic centrolobular regions, and intermediate metabolites formed in the liver were suggested as the responsible factor for this hepatotoxicity. Later in 1982, the same group assessed precocene-II-related nephrotoxicity in SD rats when administered via i.p. route: multiple (100 mg/kg body weight per day for 5 days) or single doses (200/300 mg/kg body weight) [
 <xref rid="B140-molecules-26-02933" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. Investigations specified elevated BUN (blood urea nitrogen) levels, blood congestion in the glomeruli capillaries, tubular cell deterioration, and tubular cell restoration, reflecting the possibility of nephrotoxicity after a high dose and long exposure to the compound.
