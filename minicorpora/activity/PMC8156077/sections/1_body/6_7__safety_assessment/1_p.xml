<p>In the last decade, the internal use of 
 <italic>A. conyzoides</italic> has been a matter of concern because of the distribution of some hepatotoxic constituents, pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PA), in the respective family, Asteraceae [
 <xref rid="B138-molecules-26-02933" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. Notably, the occurrence or nonappearance of PAs fluctuates greatly from region to region. Some countries such as Belgium and Germany recommend the use of PAs within the limits approved to ensure the clinical safety of patients. Clinical studies are generally performed to validate ethno-medicinal claims and to establish the safety and efficacy of preparations in humans. Even though many researchers have assessed the plant and its constituents for a safer approach; there is a still dearth of the ample facts and figures that are required for an adequate inference about the dose required for a prompt action circumventing any toxicity issue. Nonetheless, these studies deliver a quite resilient source with which to trace future investigations.
