<p id="Par9">Eleven microorganisms were used to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the extract. The used microbial strains were provided by the Iranian Research Organization for Science and Technology (IROST). Four Gram-positive bacteria were 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> (CIP 81.55), 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC 29737), 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> (ATCC 19615), and 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (ATCC 6633) and the group of Gram-negative bacteria included 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic>e (ATCC 10031), 
 <italic>Shigella dysenteriae</italic> (PTCC 1188), 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (ATCC 27853), 
 <italic>Salmonella paratyphi-A serotype</italic> (ATCC 5702), and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ATCC 10536). The used fungal strains were 
 <italic>Aspergillus brasiliensis</italic> (ATCC 16404) and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (ATCC 10231). The bacterial strains were cultured on nutrient agar and the fungal strains on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA). The plates inoculated with the bacteria and fungi cultures were incubated overnight at 37 °C and 30 °C, respectively.
