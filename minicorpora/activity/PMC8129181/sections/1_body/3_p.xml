<p>The response of ruminants to phytochemicals 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> was evaluated in 6 studies. 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2020.00569" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Hassan et al.</ext-link> observed that the supplementation of Murrah water buffaloes with a mixed phytogenics (ginger tuber, turmeric tuber, licorice roots, fennel seeds, fenugreek seeds, ajwain seeds, 
 <italic>Swertia chirata</italic> leaves, 
 <italic>Terminalia chebula</italic> fruit, 
 <italic>Citrullus colocynthis</italic> fruit, and 
 <italic>Phyllanthus emblica</italic> fruit in equal quantities) at 0, 15, 25, and 35 g/d for 6 weeks resulted in substantial changes in the rumen bacteriome composition (increased the abundances of 
 <italic>Firmicutes</italic> and 
 <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> phyla, and decreased the abundance of 
 <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> phylum and 
 <italic>Prevotella</italic> genus) and milk fatty acid (increased 
 <italic>n</italic>-3 fatty acid content and decreased stearic acid content). Heat stress in livestock causes reduction in production performance, immune responses, and health status as well as imbalances of stress-related hormones due to decreased antioxidant status, which can be ameliorated by supplementation of herbs (

The highest dose of mulberry leaf flavonoids at 45 g/d was the most appropriate dose for supplementation in lactating buffaloes to enhance lactation performance and alleviate heat-induced oxidative stress during the summer season. Additionally,

 <italic>Radix puerarin</italic> extract supplementation for 60 days at 0, 200, 400, and 800 mg/kg in the feed concentrate and reported that 
 <italic>R. puerarin</italic> extract at 400 mg/kg improved growth performance and meat quality of heat-stressed beef cattle by improving muscle total antioxidant status, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase activity and reducing muscle fiber diameter, shear force and myosin heavy-chain (fast-glycolytic) muscle fiber composition. 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2020.623710" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Galván et al.</ext-link> included a polyherbal feed mixture (
 <italic>Achyrantes aspera, Trachyspermum ammi, Citrullus colocynthis, Andrographis paniculata</italic>, and 
 <italic>Azadirachta indica</italic>) in diets of growing calves at 0, 3, 4, and 5 g/d and noted that additives at 4 g/d showed the best performance results with improved growth and health status during the pre-ruminant to the weaning period through modification of different gene expression, notably biological processes associated with tight junction, mucin biosynthesis, and intestinal immunoglobulin A production. Moreover, they reported that polyherbal treatment could improve the metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, and also immune response revealed through gene expression analysis.

 <italic>Fumaria officinalis</italic> L., 
 <italic>Malva sylvestris</italic> L., 
 <italic>Artemisia absinthium</italic> L., and 
 <italic>Matricaria chamomilla</italic> L.) at 100 g DM/d and organic zinc at 70 mg Zn/kg diet on ruminal microbial fermentation and histopathology in lambs for 70 d. Supplements did not affect the ruminal fermentation parameters or the protozoal population of the lambs; however, they lowered total ruminal bacterial population. Additionally, the study showed that long-term dietary supplementation with organic zinc combined with a mixture of medicinal herbs with a strong antioxidant capacity could negatively affect the health of the ruminal epithelium. The findings highlight that the effect of dry medicinal herb mixtures depends on the variety and synergy of herbal polyphenols and the combination of bioactive compounds.
