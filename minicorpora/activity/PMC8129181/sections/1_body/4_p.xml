<p>In summary, the research within this special issue, along with many other publications elsewhere, demonstrated the ability of phytogenic feed additives to modify nutrient digestion and ruminal microbes as well as improve health and host metabolism resulting in enhanced ruminant performance and abatement of CH
 <sub>4</sub> production. The effect of phytochemicals is dose-dependent revealing the importance of defining the optimal dose of each phytochemicals under specific conditions.
