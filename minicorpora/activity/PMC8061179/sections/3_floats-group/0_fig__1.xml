  <p>Viral titres of the supernatants collected at 72 h post infection from FCoV (10 TCID
   <sub>50</sub>)-infected CRFK cells untreated and treated with 
   <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> essential oil (TEO) at different concentrations (13.5 and 27 μg/ml).
  </p>
  <p>Viral titres were evaluated by endpoint dilution method, expressed as log10 TCID
   <sub>50</sub>/50 μl and plotted against TEO at different concentrations (A). Viral nucleic acids were quantified by qPCR, expressed as log10 viral NAs /10 μl and plotted against TEO at different concentrations (B). Bars in the figures indicate the means. Error bars indicate the standard deviation.
