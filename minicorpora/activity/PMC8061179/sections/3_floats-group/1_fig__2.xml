  <p>Virucidal effect of TEO at different concentrations (27 and 270 μg/ml) against FCoV (10,000 TCID
   <sub>50</sub>). The virus was incubated with TEO for 10 min (A), 30 min (B) and 60 min (C) at room temperature and subsequently titrated in CRFK cells. Viral titres of FCoV were expressed as log10 TCID
   <sub>50</sub>/50 μl and plotted against TEO at different concentrations. Bars in the figures indicate the means. Error bars indicate the standard deviation.
