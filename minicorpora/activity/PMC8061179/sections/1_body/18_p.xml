<p id="p0120">The chemical composition of TEO revealed the presence of 26 distinct molecules, the main fractions of which were thymol, p-cymene, γ-terpinene, β-linalool, caryophyllene. In order to reduce the cytotoxicity of TEO, it would be interesting to identify the active molecules and to test them individually. As expected, the major component of the TEO used in this study was represented by thymol. Thymol fraction has proved to have efficacy against HSV (
