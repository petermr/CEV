<p id="p0105">The virucidal activity of TEO at different concentrations and for different contact times with FCoV-II was assessed (

 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A). After 30 min, TEO at 27 and 270 μg/ml induced a decrease of 1.25 (

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) log10 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/50 μl, respectively, compared to the virus control (3.75 log10 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/50 μl) (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B). After 1 h, TEO at 27 and 270 μg/ml determined a decrease of 1.25 (p = 0.0007) and 3.25 (p &lt; 0.0001) log10 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/50 μl compared to the virus control (3.50 log10 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/50 μl). Viral inactivation occurred in a dose- and time-dependent fashion, starting from 33.33% and reaching 92.86% when TEO was used at the highest concentration (270 μg/ml), after 1 h (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C). The virucidal activity of TEO could be explained by the ability of damaging viral envelope, thus preventing adsorption and penetration into host cells (
