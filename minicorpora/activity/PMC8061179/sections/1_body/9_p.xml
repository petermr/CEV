<p id="p0075">On the basis of the cytotoxicity assay results, the antiviral activity against the FCoV-II strain 25/92 was evaluated using TEO at 27 μg/ml and also below the cytotoxic threshold (13.5 μg/ml). The use of the substance below the cytotoxic threshold allows us to reduce toxicity and to obtain effective results at a lower cost. Confluent monolayers of CRFK cells of 24 h in 24-well plates were infected with 100 μl of FCoV-II containing 10 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>, with a Multiplicity of Infection (MOI) of 0.14. After virus adsorption for 1 h at 37 °C, the inoculum was removed, cell monolayers were washed once and TEO was added. In untreated infected cells, D-MEM was used to replace the inoculum and used as virus control. After 72 h, aliquots of supernatants were collected for viral titration (
