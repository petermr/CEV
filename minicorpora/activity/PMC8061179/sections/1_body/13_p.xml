<p id="p0095">Viral titres of infected CRFK cells treated with TEO and of untreated infected cells (virus control) were expressed as the log10 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/50 μl and plotted against the drug concentrations. By comparing the viral titre of untreated infected cells (4.25 log10 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/50 μl) with infected cells treated with TEO at 13.5 and 27 μg/ml, a decrease of 0.25 (
