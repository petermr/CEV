<p id="p0080">Virucidal activity of TEO against FCoV-II was evaluated by pre-treatment of the virus (10,000 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) with TEO at 27 μg/ml and over the cytotoxic threshold (270 μg/ml) since, if used as virucide, the molecule is not posed into direct contact with the cells. In detail, 100 μl of FCoV-II were treated with TEO (1 ml) at room temperature. Virus control was used for the experiments. After 10 min, 30 min, and 1 h, aliquots of each mixture of virus-TEO and virus control were subjected to viral titration (
