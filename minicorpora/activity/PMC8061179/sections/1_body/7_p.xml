<p id="p0065">TEO cytotoxicity was assessed by XTT assay (
 <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Denizot and Lang, 1986</xref>) using the 
 <italic>In Vitro</italic> Toxicology Assay Kit (Sigma–Aldrich Srl, Milan, Italy) after exposing the cells to various compound concentrations (7.25, 14.5, 29, 58, 116, 232, 464, 928, 1856 μg/ml) for 72 h. Cytotoxicity was assessed by measuring the absorbance signal (optical density, OD), spectrophotometrically. In all experiments untreated cells were used as negative control and considered at 0% cytotoxicity. Cells treated with equivalent dilutions of DMSO were used as vehicle control. After logarithmic conversion of TEO concentrations, data obtained in the cytotoxicity assays were analyzed by a non-linear curve fitting procedure. Goodness of fit was tested by non-linear regression analysis of the dose-response curve. The maximum non-cytotoxic concentration was considered as the compound concentration at which viability of treated CRFK cells decreased by no more than 20% (CC
 <sub>20</sub>) with respect to the negative control.
