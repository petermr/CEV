<p id="p0100">Viral nucleic acids (NAs) were expressed as log10 viral NAs/10 μl of infected cells treated with TEO and of virus control and plotted against the non-cytotoxic drug concentrations. By comparing viral load of untreated infected cells (6.53 log10 viral NAs /10 μl) with infected cells treated with TEO at 13.5 and 27 μg/ml a decrease of 0.61 (
