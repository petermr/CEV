 <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Salvagno et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Rosato et al., 2018</xref>). Data from GC/MS analyses were expressed as area % ± Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). In all cases SEM was below 10%. Statistical analysis for SEM was performed using Microsoft Excel Office 2010 (Windows 7 Home Premium, Microsoft Corporation, USA). A total of 26 components were identified in TEO sample corresponding to 98.7% of the whole mixture. The detailed chemical composition of TEO was reported in Supplementary Table 1.
