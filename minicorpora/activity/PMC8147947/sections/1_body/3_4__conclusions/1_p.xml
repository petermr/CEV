<p>Plant preparations (essential oils and extracts) and pure compounds exhibit anti-biofilm activity against 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species. Some of them are characterized by high activity in concentrations below 16 mg/L. Given this activity at relatively low concentrations, some may prove to be promising alternatives to antifungal drugs, especially in the cases of resistant or multiresistant strains of 
 <italic>Candida</italic>. Moreover, the simple chemical structures involved and relative ease of extraction from natural sources warrant further research into the development of new, promising, and much-needed plant-based antifungals.
