<p>Antibiofilm activity may vary between plants in the same family. For example, in the Lamiaceae family, essential oil from 
 <italic>Lavandula dentata</italic> acted against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> biofilm at concentrations of 0.045–0.07 µL/mL [
 <xref rid="B21-jof-07-00360" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], while essential oil from 
 <italic>Satureja hortensis</italic> acted against the same biofilm at concentrations of 400–4800 mg/L [
 <xref rid="B51-jof-07-00360" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. There may also be large differences within the same species, due to various reasons. This may be influenced by, for example, different research methodologies, the use of different strains of fungi, and different chemical compositions depending on the plant variety, country, and season of harvest. A notable example of such a difference is observed with 
 <italic>Mentha × piperita</italic>. In studies by Benzaid et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-jof-07-00360" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], essential oil of 
 <italic>M. piperita</italic> acted against 
 <italic>Candida</italic> biofilm at a concentration of 10 µL/mL. However, the work of Agarwal et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-jof-07-00360" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] showed that the same essential oil was active at 800 µL/mL.
