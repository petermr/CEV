<p>Changes in the content of active substances were described by Gonçalves et al. [
 <xref rid="B56-jof-07-00360" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. They showed that in essential oil from 
 <italic>Mentha cervina</italic> collected in August, the amount of isomenthone was 8.7% and pulegone was 75.1%. However, in essential oil collected in February, the ratio of the two compounds reversed and amounted to 77.0% for isomenthone and 12.9% for pulegone. The method of obtaining the compounds likewise had an influence on their content in the final essential oil. In a study by Ćavar et al. [
 <xref rid="B57-jof-07-00360" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], the composition of essential oils of 
 <italic>Calamintha glandulosa</italic> differed depending on the extraction method. The level of menthone was 3.3% using aqueous reflux extraction, 4.7% using hydrodistillation, and 8.3% using steam distillation, while the concentration of shisofuran was only 0.1% using hydrodistillation and steam distillation, while aqueous reflux yielded 9.7%.
