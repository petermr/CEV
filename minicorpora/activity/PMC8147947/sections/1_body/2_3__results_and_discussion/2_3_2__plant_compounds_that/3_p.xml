<p>According to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST), the antifungal clinical breakpoints are between 0.001 mg/L and 16 mg/L [
 <xref rid="B60-jof-07-00360" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Using EUCAST guidelines in this review, the most active compounds that inhibit (&gt;50%) 
 <italic>Candida</italic> biofilm formation are lichochalcone A (from 0.2 mg/L) [
 <xref rid="B61-jof-07-00360" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], thymol (from 3.12 mg/L) [
 <xref rid="B26-jof-07-00360" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], dioscin (from 3.9 mg/L) [
 <xref rid="B31-jof-07-00360" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], baicalein (from 4 mg/L) [
 <xref rid="B62-jof-07-00360" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], warburganal (4.5 mg/L) [
 <xref rid="B52-jof-07-00360" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], pterostilbene, waltheriones and riccardin D (both from 8 mg/L) [
 <xref rid="B63-jof-07-00360" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,
 <xref rid="B64-jof-07-00360" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,
 <xref rid="B65-jof-07-00360" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], polygodial (10.8 mg/L) [
 <xref rid="B52-jof-07-00360" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], cannabidiol and eugenol (both from 12.5 mg/L) [

 <xref rid="B66-jof-07-00360" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], and ivalin (15.4 mg/L) [
 <xref rid="B67-jof-07-00360" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. It is interesting that monotherpenes, which represent the highest percentage of substances listed in 
 <xref rid="jof-07-00360-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, are not the most active compounds. The two larger groups with the best activity are phenolic compounds (thymol, pterostilbene, and eugenol), and sesquiterpene derivatives (warburganal, polygodial, and ivalin). Single compounds with the highest observed activity belong to chalconoids (lichochalcone A), steroidal saponins (dioscin), flavonoids (baicalein), alkaloids (waltheriones), macrocyclic bisbibenzyls (riccardin D), and cannabinoids (cannabidiol). Most of the compounds presented in 
 <xref rid="jof-07-00360-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> acted on biofilm formation and/or mature biofilm.
