<p>In terms of activity, large differences were found, depending on the authors cited. Eugenol and thymol serve as good examples. Both compounds exhibited excellent activity in some studies (from 12.5 mg/L for eugenol [

 <xref rid="B26-jof-07-00360" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]), and in other studies, the activity was very poor (up to 80,000 for both [
 <xref rid="B59-jof-07-00360" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]). These differences may be related, for example, to a different purity of the compound, a different fungal suspension density, or even to the use of other
