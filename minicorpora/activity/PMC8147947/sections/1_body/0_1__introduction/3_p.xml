<p>Treatment of candidiasis depends on the infection site and the patientâ€™s condition. According to guidelines, vulvovaginal candidiasis should be treated with oral or topical fluconazole; however, regarding 
 <italic>C. glabrata</italic> infection, topical boric acid, nystatin, or flucytosine is suggested. In oropharyngeal candidiasis, the treatment options include clotrimazole, miconazole, or nystatin, and in severe disease, fluconazole or voriconazole. In candidemia and invasive candidiasis, the drugs of choice are echinocandins (caspofungin, micafungin, anidulafungin), fluconazole, or voriconazole; in resistant strains, amphoteticin B is used. In selected cases of candidemia caused by 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic>, voriconazole is recommended [

 <xref rid="B12-jof-07-00360" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. More details can be found in the Guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [
 <xref rid="B12-jof-07-00360" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases [
 <xref rid="B11-jof-07-00360" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Increasingly, 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species are becoming resistant to drugs. Marak and Dhanashree [
 <xref rid="B13-jof-07-00360" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] tested the resistance of 90 
 <italic>Candida</italic> strains isolated from different clinical samples, such as pus, urine, blood, and body fluid. Their study revealed that about 41% of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> strains are resistant to fluconazole and voriconazole. Simultaneously, about 41% of 
 <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> strains are resistant to voriconazole and about 36% of strains to fluconazole. In strains of 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic>, about 23% are resistant to fluconazole and about 18% to voriconazole. Rudramurthy et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-jof-07-00360" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] studied resistance in 
 <italic>C. auris</italic>, which is considered a multiresistant pathogen. Among 74 strains obtained from patients with candidemia, over 90% of strains were resistant to fluconazole and about 73% to voriconazole. Virulence factors of 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species include the secretion of hydrolases, the transition of yeast to hyphae, phenotypic switching, and biofilm formation [
 <xref rid="B15-jof-07-00360" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-jof-07-00360" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. All microorganisms in biofilm form are more resistant to antimicrobial and host factors, which leads to difficulties in eradication [
 <xref rid="B17-jof-07-00360" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. It has also been shown that resistance to drugs increases significantly in the case of 
 <italic>Candida</italic> biofilm occurrence. Biofilm prevents the spread of antifungals; moreover, fluconazole is bound by the biofilm matrix [
 <xref rid="B18-jof-07-00360" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The formation of a 
 <italic>Candida</italic> biofilm during infection increases mortality, length of hospital stay, and cost of antifungal therapy [
