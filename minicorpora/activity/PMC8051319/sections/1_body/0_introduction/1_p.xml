<p>Tooth decay is one of the most common infectious diseases in humans. The most important cause of tooth decay is the attachment of oral bacteria especially 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> to different oral surfaces. To do this, these bacteria first attach to the thin salivary membrane by adhesions proteins and accumulate in the biofilm in the presence of sucrose and glucans synthesized by Glucosyltransferases, eventually producing acid and creating a low-pH environment (Ferreira et al., 2020
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>)(Chi, 2013
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). Given the importance of binding properties of these bacteria and their ability to form biofilm that ultimately provides the basis for the destruction of tooth enamel, it is essential to find natural substances capable of inhibiting biofilm formation.
