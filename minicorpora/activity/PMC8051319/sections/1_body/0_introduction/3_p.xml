<p>Biofilm formation is a very fast process that always involves several steps; also, active participation of microbial cells is essential for adhesion. Production of extracellular polymeric materials is of great importance for biofilm formation and surface structures such as pili and flagella (Chen and Wang, 2010

Biofilms from pathogenic microorganisms play an important role in human health and usually, they do not respond well to treatment due to their resistance to detergents and antimicrobial agents.

Identification and evaluation of antimicrobial compounds in extracts and essential oils of medicinal plants as new drug against this challenge, seem to be important (Ghasemi et al., 2012
