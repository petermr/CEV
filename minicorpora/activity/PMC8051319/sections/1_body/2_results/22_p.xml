<p>The PCR reaction using primers designed based on genomic isolates of 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> and their electrophoresis performed by 1% agarose gel is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>. 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> was assayed by primers for 
 <italic>rpoB</italic> gene that contained 151 bp fragments with 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> amplification of the 
 <italic>rpoB</italic> gene indicating the presence of this gene in the bacterium. To probe 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>, the PCR reaction was performed using a specific primer pair of the 
 <italic>rpoA</italic> gene, which provided 198 fragments of fragment to amplify the 
 <italic>rpoA</italic> gene, indicating the presence of this gene in 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> bacterium (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>).
