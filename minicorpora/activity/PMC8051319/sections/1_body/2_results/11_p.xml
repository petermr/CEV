<p>The mixture of the studied medicinal plants was exposed to each of the 7 oral microbes and examined by a light microscope following 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 hr of exposure. The samples were Gram stained and examined by the light microscope (at 100X;

The results of cell structure analysis of oral bacteria exposed to the plant extracts in comparison with the control at several exposure time-points, showed that cocci shape transformed into oval shape and cell destruction was observed. These effects increased with increasing exposure time
