<p>Anti-adherence and antibacterial properties of Psidium, Mangifera and Mentha against 
 <italic>Streptococcus sanguinis</italic> and 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>, were studied by Shafiei et al. (2016)
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr"> â–¶</xref>. Low MIC was achieved by the synergistic effect of the plant extracts. Different anti-adherence and antibacterial effect against 
 <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic> was shown to be due to different proportion of active materials of the herbal extracts.
