<p>In Lang et al. study, the combined effects of essential oils of 
 <italic>M. piperita</italic>, cinnamon and garlic on biofilm formation by 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (PA01), were examined. Their results showed that adhesion and initiation of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (PA01) biofilm production, was decreased. Oil was inhibited and at higher concentrations of these compounds completely removed the biofilm (Lang et al., 2016

 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilm formation are consistent with the results of the present study.
