<p>Samples from oral cavity, tongue tip, and gingival groove were collected using a sterile swab. The specimens were cultured on a Mueller-Hinton agar medium (Merck, KGaA) containing 5% sheep blood and incubated at 37°C for 18 to 24 hr. Bacteria were isolated and diagnosed on the basis of colony morphology, Gram staining, and biochemical tests. Furthermore, four standard bacterial strains
