<p>Wound healing properties of the herbal mixture were assessed by the following method. Anesthesia using ketamine and xylazine was induced. Back hair was shaved and disinfected; then, using circular marker and ruler, circles of approximately 2 cm in diameter, were drawn on the back of the animal. The skin was completely removed by a razor blade, so that the depth of the wound included dermis and epidermis. Wounds were taken care of and the animals were kept in separate cages. Animals were randomly divided into 3 groups of 6. The first group was the control group that received no treatment, the second group was daily treated with Vaseline ointment twice daily, and the third group was daily treated with the herbal mixture 2 times daily at specific times (every 12hr) for a period of 7, 14, 21 and 30 days.</p>
