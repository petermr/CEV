<p>DNA polymerase Taq, restriction enzymes, DNA ladder (100 base pair), ethidium bromide, etc. were prepared from Fanavaran gene company (Iran). The reaction was carried out at a final volume of 25 µl. In this reaction, 1 µlof the template DNA, 5 µlof DNA polymerase taq (5 units per microliter), 0.5 ml of each initiator, 2 µlof the mixed dNTPs (2.5 mM), 2.5 µlPCR buffer (10 x) and 1.5 µlof MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> salt (50 mM) were mixed together; the final volume was set at 25 µl using distilled water. The PCR program was performed at 35 cycles (
