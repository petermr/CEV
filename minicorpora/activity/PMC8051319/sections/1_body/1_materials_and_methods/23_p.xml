<p>Based on the light microscopy results, one of the bacteria was randomly selected and when the changes were observed by light microscopy, the same exposure time was considered for examination by electron microscopy. For this purpose, the test was repeated at the determined concentration of the bacterium and the herbal material. The sample was centrifuged for 4 min at 2000 rpm in 1hr exposure time. The precipitate from the centrifuge was separated from its supernatant and washed using physiological serum and distilled water at 50:50 concentrations. The supernatant was discarded again and the precipitate was put in 2.5% glutaraldehyde stabilization buffer for 24 hr. The sample was then immobilized with sodium cacodylate buffer and osmium tetroxide. Sample dehydration was carried out in 50, 70, 90 and 100% ethanol (three times). The solution was stirred three times each for 20 min. The specimens were mixed in resin and propylene oxide mixtures at different ratios as follows: first, at a ratio of one to three resins and propylene oxide, then, at a ratio of one to one and finally, at a ratio of three to one (each for two times). The specimens were molded to polymerize at 60Â°C for two to three days and sectioned using an ultra-microtome. The sections were mounted on a copper grid impregnated with carbon form to protect the specimen from possible damages such as cracking and breaking. Uranyl acetate 1% and lead citrate were stained for optimum contrast and finally, the sample was dried. Finally, the sections were placed on the grid and examined by TEM.</p>
