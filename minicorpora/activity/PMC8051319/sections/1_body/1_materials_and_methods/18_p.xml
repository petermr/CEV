<p>Determination of MIC was carried out in 96-well plates. For this purpose, 100 µlof bacterial suspension equivalent to 0.5 McFarland was added to all wells of the plates. Then, 100 µl of the plant mixture was added the first well and completely sampled and then, 100 µl from the first well was removed and added to the next well. This procedure went on until well #10. Well No. 11 (positive control) contained 100 µl of bacterial culture medium. Since the extracts are generally colored and cause an optical absorption reading error, well No. 12 (control) contained 100 µlof pure extract or essential oil for determination of the optical absorption of the extract or essence. Optical absorption for all microplates were read at the 545 nm wavelength using an ELISA reader (Coffey and Anderson, 2014
