<p>Coffey method was accomplished as follows: A sterile 96-well microtitre polystyrene plate was used to evaluate the inhibitory effect of 10 microliter herbal materials (in 0.1 mg/ml concentration) on biofilm-producing bacteria. First, the bacterium was prepared equal 0.5 McFarland standards, then, BHI broth medium (Germany, Merck) with 2% sucrose was added. Next, the bacteria were inoculated into the wells and then the test substances were added to each well at different concentrations and placed in 37°C incubator for 48 hr. Herbal material and bacteria were considered positive and negative controls in the 11
 <sup>th</sup> and 12
 <sup>th</sup> wells respectively. After 48hr. of incubation, all wells were slowly emptied, and to stabilize the bacterial biofilm, 200 µl of pure methanol was added to the wells for 10 min and kept at room temperature. After emptying, the crystal violet was added and exposed to this color and room temperature for 20 min and rinsed with DW. Finally, Absorbance was read at 550 nm using a spectrophotometer (Coffey and Anderson, 2014
