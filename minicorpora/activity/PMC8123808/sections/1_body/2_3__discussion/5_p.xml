<p>In the present investigation, two Gram-negative bacterial strains, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, were chosen for measuring the antibacterial activity as these bacteria are becoming resistant to various drugs, and scientists are exploring new molecules to combat these resistant strains. In this study, both samples exhibited antibacterial effects against both selected Gram-negative bacteria, where the MIC of EC-I was lower than that of EC-G oil. In the current study, we obtained 10.13 and 14.4 mm zone of inhibition and MIC 1 mg/mL and 0.5 mg/mL against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> for EC-G and EC-I respectively. Similarly, we obtained 12.33 and 16.66 mm zone of inhibition and MIC 0.5 mg/mL and 0.25 mg/mL against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> for EC-G and EC-I respectively, which indicates that the tested oils are effective. In a previous study, Noumi et al., (2018) reported the range of MIC of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (0.048â€“0.097mg/mL) and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (0.048 mg/mL) for the green cardamom essential oil, which supports the present antimicrobial activity [

 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (22.7 mm and 19.67 mm, respectively), we could not test the MIC due to certain limitations. Similar zones of inhibition for gentamycin have also been reported in previous studies [

 <xref rid="B30-molecules-26-02546" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Compared to the MIC of gentamycin from literature, i.e., less than 0.00156 mg/mL and 0.00313 mg/mL against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa,</italic> respectively [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-26-02546" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], we get another interpretation, which is that the antibacterial activity is present, but compared to the positive control, it seems marginal. This, however, is not surprising as an extract is the mixture of compounds with different chemical constituents amongst whom some may and some may not have antibacterial activities. Hence, isolation of these compounds would be the ideal method to predict whether or not the antibacterial activity is at an appreciable extent or not. Thus, for adding further validity, we will direct our future studies to not only assess the effect of cardamom oil on different pathogenic bacteria involved in gastrointestinal diseases but we will also test the different compounds isolated and subsequently compare them with respective controls including vancomycin and gentamycin for Gram-positive and Gram-negative microbes respectively.
