<p>The concentration of sesquiterpene D-germacrene was higher in the essential oils of EC-I, whereas β-elemene, α-murolene, bicyclo[5.2.0]nonane, 2-methylene-4,8,8-trimethyl-4-vinyl-, δ-guaiene, γ-gurjunene, 
 <sc>d</sc>-germacrene, 
 <italic>D</italic>-nerolidol, (

 <italic>Z</italic>)-farnesal, trans-caryophyllene oxide, aromadendrene oxide-(1), and farnesyl acetate were in higher concentrations in the essential oil of EC-G capsules. Sesquiterpenes such as α-selinene, α -caryophyllene, and (
 <italic>Z</italic>,
 <italic>E</italic>)-farnesal were identified only in the essential oil of EC-I, whereas ledene, alloaromadendrene, α-cadinol, γ-eudesmol, 10-epi, β-spathulenol, longifolenaldehyde, costunolide, and isoaromadendrene epoxide were identified only in EC-G. Diterpene and α-springene were observed in both the samples (0.43% and 1.08% in EC-G and EC-I oils, respectively), whereas cembrene, kauran-18-al, 17-(acetyloxy)-, (4.beta), and thunbergol were found only in the essential oil of EC-G. Some of these components have not been previously reported in the GC-MS analysis of cardamom essential oil.
