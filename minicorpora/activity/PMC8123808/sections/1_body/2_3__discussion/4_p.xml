<p>In the current study, monoterpenes were in higher concentrations in EC-I (83.24%) than in EC-G (73.03%), whereas sesquiterpenes were in higher concentrations in EC-G (18.35%) than in EC-I (9.27%). However, no significant differences in diterpenes (1.03% and 1.08% in the EC-G and EC-I, respectively) were reported between EC-I and EC-G. Gradinaru et al. reported 84.54% oxygenated monoterpenes and 8.27% monoterpene hydrocarbons [
