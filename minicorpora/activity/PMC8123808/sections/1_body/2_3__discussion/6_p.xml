<p>The major compounds α-terpinyl acetate (24.65%) and 1,8-Cineole (14.03%) were identified higher in EC-I than EC-G (18.71% and 10.59% respectively). The high anti-bacterial effects of EC-I are mainly due to these compounds and the other compounds that have antibacterial effects. The compound α-terpinyl acetate is nontoxic and has an effect on neurological disease with anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects [
