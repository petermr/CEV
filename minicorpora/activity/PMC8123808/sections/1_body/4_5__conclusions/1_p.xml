<p>The present findings of GC–MS analysis revealed that α-terpinyl acetate and 1,8 cineole are the major components comparatively higher in EC-I. Monoterpenes were identified as the major components in both the essential oils; however, EC-I was showed to have a higher percentage of monoterpenes than EC-G. Both EC-G and EC-I oils possessed significant antibacterial activity, with EC-I processing more active components than EC-G essential oils. In addition to the antibacterial activity, essential oil of 
 <italic>E. cardamomum</italic> also exhibited antidiarrheal effects along with the antispasmodic activity. Overall, these differences may be due to the presence of different percentages of active and other constituents in the EC-G and EC-I samples. Thus, EC-I exerts more potent antidiarrheal and antispasmodic effects than EC-G. Therefore, present finding delivers a scientific support for the possible future use of E. cardamomum essential oil as an antidiarrheal agent.
