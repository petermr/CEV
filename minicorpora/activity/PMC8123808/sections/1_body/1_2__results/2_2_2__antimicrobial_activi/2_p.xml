<p>The ZOI differed marginally with different capsules and microorganisms used in the assay. Both the samples and the standard drug were detected to be inhibitory to 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, and the EC-I oil was showed to be the most active agent. The MIC of EC-G oil was observed to be 0.5 and 1 mg/mL, whereas that of EC-I was 0.25 and 0.5 mg/mL against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> respectively. Thus, the EC-I oil was more active against both the Gram-negative bacteria.
