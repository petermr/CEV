<p>Protection in castor oil-provoked diarrhea: Both orally administered samples of EC-I and EC-G exhibited dose-dependent protection of mice, whereas the saline group did not exhibit any effect. At the lower tested dose of EC.I (100 mg/kg), two out of five mice exhibited protection, indicating 40% protection. A higher dose of 200 mg/kg exhibited 80% protection, whereas 20% and 60% protection was observed at lower (100 mg/kg) and higher doses (200 mg/kg), respectively. No diarrheal spot was observed in any mice treated with loperamide (100% protection) (
