<p>Similarly, EC-I exhibited a lethal effect on the growth of both 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> after 8 h of incubation. The plot of both samples measured at the 2-MIC stage was approximately identical to that at 1-MIC. EC-I exhibited a rapid killing effect on 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> development, with a lethal effect after 4 h of incubation and after 8 h on 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. The effects of EC-I on 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> growth were destroyed after 8 h of incubation.
