<p>Similarly, non-treated 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> exhibited growth from 5.17 to 8.17 log
 <sub>10</sub> CFU/mL and moved after 8 h into the static phase. After treatment with EC-G, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> growth decreased dramatically in the first 4 h and retained steadily at approximately 2.94 × log
 <sub>10</sub> CFU/mL. After treatment with EC-I, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> growth decreased in the first 4 h and was retained steadily at approximately 2.04 × log
 <sub>10</sub> CFU/mL, suggesting a stronger EC-I killing efficacy against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. The plot of both the samples assessed at the 2 × MIC level was almost similar to that at 1 × MIC. The results indicated that EC-G exhibits a lethal effect on 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> after 4 h and 8 h, respectively.
