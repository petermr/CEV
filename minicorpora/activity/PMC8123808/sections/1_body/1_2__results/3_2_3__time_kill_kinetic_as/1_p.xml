<p>Time-kill assays were performed to explore the cell viability (kill-time) of EC-G and EC-I essential oil, and the results were articulated as a logarithm of viable counts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02546-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Non-treated 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> exhibited growth from 5.24 to 8.32 log
 <sub>10</sub> CFU/mL and moved into the static phase after 8 h. After treatment with EC-G, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> growth decreased dramatically in the first 8 h and retained steadily at approximately 3.45 × log
 <sub>10</sub> CFU/mL, whereas EC-I treatment decreased the growth in the first 8 h and retained steadily at approximately 2.99 × log
 <sub>10</sub> CFU/mL, suggesting a stronger EC-I killing efficacy against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>.
