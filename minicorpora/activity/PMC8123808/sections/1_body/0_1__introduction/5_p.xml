<p>These differences could be attributed to the variability or differences in solvent extraction. Therefore, comparative studies of different species must be conducted not only to understand their full potential as herbs but also to identify the most preferable species, because cardamom growing in a specific region provides more health benefits than those growing in other regions. Additionally, a number of these activities have been tested in aqueous methanolic extracts rather than essential oils, which may exhibit different activities depending on the constituents eluted. Therefore, the present study attempted to compare the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Guatemalan and Indian 
 <italic>E. cardamomum</italic> against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and to explore the in vivo antidiarrheal effect and in vitro antispasmodic activity of the two oils to clarify differences in their medicinal properties.
