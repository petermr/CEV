 <italic>E. cardamomum</italic> oil is known for its characteristic aroma and is widely used in the food and cosmetic industries as a flavoring and fragrance agent. It is an intestinal smooth muscle relaxant [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-26-02546" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and has exhibited antispasmodic, antidiarrheal, and antibacterial activities [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-26-02546" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-02546" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The antibacterial effect of essential oil of 
 <italic>E. cardamomum</italic> against several Gram-negative bacteria [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-02546" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] such as 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> has been reported. 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> commonly resides in human colon and frequently causes diarrhea [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-02546" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], whereas 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> also causes diarrhea, and it may effect immune-deficient or antibiotic-treated individuals, which is difficult to treat due to its innate resistance to several antibiotics [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-02546" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-26-02546" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-02546" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> transmitted through the food chain may cause gastrointestinal infections [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-02546" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Hence, both of these organisms directly or indirectly are potentially involved in the etiology of diarrhea.
