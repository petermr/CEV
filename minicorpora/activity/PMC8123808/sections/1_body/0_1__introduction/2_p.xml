<p>Volatile oils were demonstrated to be good sources of bioactive compounds, in the form of cyclic and acyclic, non-oxygenated or oxygenated hydrocarbons of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and diterpenes. It is used in the treatment of several disease conditions such relieving pain, wound, nausea, and cancer lesions in folk medicine [
