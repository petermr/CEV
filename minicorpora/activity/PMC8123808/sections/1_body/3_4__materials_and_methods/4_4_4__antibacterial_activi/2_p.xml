<p>The bacterial inocula were streaked onto an MHA plate by using a sterile swab. A 6-mm sterile disk was impregnated with 10 µL of 5 mg/mL EC-I and EC-G essential oil prepared in 2% DMSO, and 2% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used as the negative control. The plates were labelled, and the disks containing essential oil were placed onto the plates and incubated for 18–24 h at 37 °C. The diameter of inhibition around the disk was measured and the mean of three tests was reported as the zone of inhibition. Gentamicin (10 µg) was used as a positive control. </p>
