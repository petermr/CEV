<p>The antibacterial effect of the EC-I and EC-G oils was tested against two bacterial strains, namely 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (ATCC 27853) and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (ATCC 35218). The antibacterial activity of the essential oils was assayed using the disc diffusion method [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-26-02546" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] with some modification, and each test was repeated thrice. Mueller–Hinton agar (MHA) was used for the antibacterial assay. 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> cultures in nutrient broth (HiMedia labs, Mumbai, India) were separately inoculated and grown for 18 h at 37 °C. The suspension of both the organisms was separately diluted with saline (phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) to obtain 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> colony forming units (CFU/mL) of microbial suspension.
