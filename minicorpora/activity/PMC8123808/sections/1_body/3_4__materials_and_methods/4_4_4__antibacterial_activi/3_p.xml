<p>Different concentrations (4, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25, and 0.125 mg/mL) of EC-I and EC-G essential oil were prepared in analytical grade 2% DMSO and used for the determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) through the broth dilution method according to methods described by CLSI 2006 [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-26-02546" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. To each diluted tube, 100 µL inoculum was seeded and the control tubes (no bacterial inoculation) were simultaneously maintained. All tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and the lowest concentration of the essential oils that produced no visible bacterial growth was recorded.
