<p>The method described by Shah et al., [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-26-02546" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] was followed to sacrifice rats and to isolate the ileum, the last part of the small intestine. Briefly, rats were anaesthetized with thiopental sodium (70 mg/kg, given intraperitoneally) and then cervically dislocated by a blow on the head. Following isolation, required segments of the ileum (2–3 cm length) were cleaned from adjacent tissues and fecal material and mounted in a tissue bath (volume 20 mL) that was attached with an isotonic transducer coupled to a digital PowerLab (ML-845) data acquisition system (AD Instruments; Sydney, Australia) and a computer using lab chart software (Version 5.3). A fresh tyrode was filled in 20-mL tissue baths gassed with carbogen, and temperature was set at 37 °C. The composition of Tyrode’s solution (mM) was as follows: KCl, 2.68; NaCl, 136.9; MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 1.05; NaHCO
 <sub>3</sub>, 11.90; NaH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub>, 0.42; CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 1.8; and glucose, 5.55; pH 7.4. Tension of 1 g was applied by rotating the transducer knob clockwise, and the tissues were left for stabilisation for 30 min with multiple exposures to acetylcholine (0.3 µM). After obtaining the stable band in the spontaneous ileal contractions, test samples were added to the bath solution in increasing concentrations, which resulted in the inhibition of the CCh and high K
 <sup>+</sup>-induced contractions.
