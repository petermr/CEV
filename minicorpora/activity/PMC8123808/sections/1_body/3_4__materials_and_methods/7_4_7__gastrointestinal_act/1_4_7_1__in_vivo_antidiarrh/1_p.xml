<p>A total of 35 mice were arbitrarily allocated to seven groups with equal numbers of mice in each group. Following 24 h of fasting, mice of the first and second groups were exposed to oral gavage of saline (10 mL/kg) and labelled as sham control and negative control, respectively. After pilot screening for dose selection, the third and fourth groups (test groups) were administered two increasing doses of EC-I (100 and 200 mg/kg; P.O), whereas the fifth and sixth groups were administered EC-G (100 and 200 mg/kg). The last group was administered loperamide (10 mg/kg, P.O.) and labelled as the positive control. Separate cages were assigned to each animal with a blotting sheet on the floor of each cage to know the absence or presence of diarrhea by a blinded observer. After 1 h, all mice except the sham controls were orally exposed to castor oil (10 mL/kg) by using a 1-mL syringe. After 4 h, blotting sheets in all individual cages were inspected for typical diarrheal droppings. Protection was noted in the case of diarrheal drops, as previously reported by Rehman et al., [
