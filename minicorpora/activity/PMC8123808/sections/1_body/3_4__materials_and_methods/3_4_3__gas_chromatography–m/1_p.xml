<p>The gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis of EC-I and EC-G essential oils was performed using the Shimadzu GC–MS system (TQ-8040, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with auto-sampler (AOC-20i). Analysis of the chemical composition was performed in the ionization mode (70 eV) with a scan time of 0.3 s and

 <italic>z</italic> range of 45–400 u. Both the injector and detector temperatures were set at 210 °C. The Rxi-5 MS capillary column (0.25 mm inner diameter, 30 m × 0.25 μm) contained the stationary phase comprising 5% two-phenyl and 95% two-methyl polysiloxane. The column temperature was programmed as follows: Initial oven temperature programmed at 40 °C, held for 3 min; gradually raised to 90 °C at 3 °C/min, held for 4 min; raised to 115 °C at 3 °C/min, held for 10 min; and then increased to 140 °C at 2 °C/min and held for 8 min. Finally, the column temperature was increased to 210 °C at 3 °C/min and held for 5 min. The carrier gas was helium (99.995%) at a constant flow rate of 1 mL/min. The oil identification composition was based on a comparison of their mass spectra and retention time with data of libraries, NIST-14 and NIST-14s (National Institute of Standards and Technologies, Mass Spectra Libraries, Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA) [
