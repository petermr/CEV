<p>Time-kill kinetics of essential oil of EC-G and EC-I samples was performed using the method described by Kang et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-26-02546" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] with slight modification. Two concentrations equivalent to 1 × MIC (1 mg/mL and 0.5 mg/mL for 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, respectively) and 2 × MIC (2 mg/mL and 1 mg/mL for 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, respectively) of the essential oil were prepared. An inoculum size of 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL was added and incubated at 37 °C. A total of 1-mm inoculum of the medium was obtained at different time intervals of 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 h. The colony forming unit (CFU) of the bacterial cells was determined. A negative control containing organisms and DMSO (without essential oil) was also evaluated. The assays were performed in triplicate, and time-kill graphs were constructed by calculating the log CFU/mL of mean colony count against time.
