 <italic>Animals: Wistar</italic> rats (200–250 g; 6–8 weeks old) and Swiss albino mice (25–30 g; 12 weeks or more) of either sex were purchased from the local animal vendors and housed in the animal house of the Barrett Hodgson University (BHU), Karachi, Pakistan. The animals were placed in the transparent plastic rectangular cages (47 × 34 × 18 cm
 <sup>3</sup>) whose bedding (sawdust) was refreshed every 48 h. Standard temperature (23–25 °C) and a light:dark (12:12) cycle were maintained. During housing, the health status of the animals was also monitored. Standard animal diet was fed, which comprised of flour (380 g/kg), fish meal (170 g/kg), fiber (380 g/kg), molasses (12 g/kg), NaCl (5.8 g/kg), nutrivet L. (2.5 g/kg), potassium metabisulfate (1.2 g/kg), powdered milk (150 g/kg) and vegetable oil (38 g/kg), whereas they were provided with water ad libitum. Before the commencement of the experiments, animals were fasted for a day before the experiment (24 h), however, they were provided with a supply of water. The rats were sacrificed under light anesthesia (using thiopental sodium 70–90 mg/kg; i.p.), followed by cervical dislocation. The guidelines detailed in the National Research Council [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-26-02546" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] were followed for all animal-based experiments. The protocols were approved by the Ethical Committee of Research on Animals of the BHU bearing ERC number: BHU-ERC/Pharmacy-001/2020/PI-Dr. Amber Hanif Palla. All results were reported in accordance with the Animal Research: Report of In-vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines [
