<p>Results of the antibacterial assay were expressed as the mean of three repeated experiments. Protection from diarrhea was statistically evaluated by comparing all the groups with the saline control group by using Chi square (χ
 <sup>2</sup>) test. A 
 <italic>p</italic> value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results of the antispasmodic activity assay are expressed as mean ± standard error of mean (SEM). The statistical parameters applied were Student’s 
 <italic>t</italic>-test or two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s post-test for multiple comparisons of concentration-response curves (CRCs) with control. Graph Pad prism (version 4) was used for regression analysis of CRCs.
