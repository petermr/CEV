  <p>The yield of infectious BVDV virus produced in infected MDBK cells treated with α-humulene. MDBK cells were infected with BVDV (multiplicity of infection, m.o.i. = 0.1). The infected cultures were treated with α-humulene at indicated doses (100, 20, 4, 0.8 µM). Viral yields in the culture supernatant were collected and tittered 72 h after infection. Results are expressed as mean ± standard deviationfrom threeseparate experiments done in triplicate. Statistically significant differences are expressed as follows: *** = 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, ns =not statistically significant.
