<p>Compounds’ activity against HIV-1 was determined by the MTT method, as reported previously [
 <xref rid="B34-pathogens-10-00403" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Compounds’ activity against DENV-2, WNV, and YFV was based on inhibition of cytopathogenicity virus-induced in BHK-21 cells acutely infected at an m.o.i. of 0.01. Compounds’ activity against BVDV was based on inhibition of virus-induced cytopathogenicity in MDBK cells acutely infected at an m.o.i. of 0.01. Briefly, BHK and MDBK cells wereplated in 96-well plates (5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> and 3 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per well, respectively). The monolayers were then infected with a proper virus dilution (50 μL) of MEM-Earl with L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 0.025 g/L kanamycin, with 1% inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS). Moreover, 50 μL of medium, with or without serial dilutions of test compounds, was added. After 72 h of incubation at 37 °C, cell viability was determined by the MTT method.
