<p>In particular, 
 <italic>α</italic>-humulene was found to be non-cytotoxic and was able to reduce the viral BVDV titer in vitro assays in a dose-dependent manner. These results require further investigation and additional studies to understand the mechanism of action of the active molecule. Although they have been shown to have interesting potential against BVDV, the constituent mixture of 
 <italic>Salvia officinalis</italic> Essential Oil has no greater potential than a single constituent. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scientific communication reporting the anti-BVDV effects of 
 <italic>Salvia officinalis</italic> essential oil with α-humulene as the main active component.
