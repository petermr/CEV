 <p>Indigenous medicinal plants enriched with flavonoids, alkaloids, poly-phenolic compounds carry antiseptic, disinfectant and antimicrobial activities. During old era, plant extracts were used as strong antiseptics and disinfectants to get ride from microbes. We aimed to present the herbal formulations and preparations for human health hazards free hand sanitizers based on indigenous medicinal plants with reported effective results against infectious microbes along with least toxic impact on environment. Easily available plants formulations safe to human health and environment are presented with easy procedure for their preparations. Data have been collected from literature for dissemination to scientific community and common society. A recent report published on human health hazards linked with the frequent use of alcohol based hand sanitizers provoked the scientific community to prepare safe hand rubs. National Poison Data System, USA revealed 36.7% increase in alcoholic hand sanitizer exposure and toxicity in first three months of 2020 as compared to 2019. Adaptation of alternative preparations of hand sanitizers based on natural and plant resources are the possible solution to get ride off toxicity problem. There should be more detailed screenings of indigenous plants with enriched flavonoids contents for their antiseptic properties and to develop eco-friendly and effective hand sanitizers as compared to chemical formulations.</p>
