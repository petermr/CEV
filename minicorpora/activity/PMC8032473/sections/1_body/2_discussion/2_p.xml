To lessen the threat of disease spread in the community, it is recommended to prioritize better hygiene practices including washing and sanitizing hands frequently and thoroughly. Individually, people are observed to be using alcohol based hand sanitizer with 60–70% alcohol as suggested by 
 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">CDC (2020)</xref>, regularly upon meeting other individuals outside or on return back to home. It is reported that spraying of individual with substances such as alcohol, chlorine is responsible for the toxic influence on entities and lead towards eye and skin irritation, bronchospasm due to inhalation, and possibly gastrointestinal effects such as vomiting and nausea (

In starting six months of 2020, AAPCC stated 10,824 hand sanitizer’s (alcoholic) exposure cases in children under 12 years age and acknowledged that even a minor dose of alcohol may results alcohol poisoning in/among children which is liable for confusion, nausea and lethargy, and in extreme cases, respiratory seizure and death (

Published data showed overall increase of 20.4% as compared to first three months of 2019 and 16.4% as compared to first three months of 2018. Though, National Poison Data System did not provided any evidence or linkage between chemical exposure and COVID-19 cleaning practices, there seems to be a strong temporal link with amplified usage of such products. Daily reports of call to poison center increased abruptly in early March 2020 (
