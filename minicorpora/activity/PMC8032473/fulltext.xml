During old era, plant extracts were used as strong antiseptics and disinfectants to get ride from microbes. We aimed to present the herbal formulations and preparations for human health hazards free hand sanitizers based on indigenous medicinal plants with reported effective results against infectious microbes along with least toxic impact on environment. Easily available plants formulations safe to human health and environment are presented with easy procedure for their preparations. Data have been collected from literature for dissemination to scientific community and common society. A recent report published on human health hazards linked with the frequent use of alcohol based hand sanitizers provoked the scientific community to prepare safe hand rubs. National Poison Data System, USA revealed 36.7% increase in alcoholic hand sanitizer exposure and toxicity in first three months of 2020 as compared to 2019. Adaptation of alternative preparations of hand sanitizers based on natural and plant resources are the possible solution to get ride off toxicity problem. There should be more detailed screenings of indigenous plants with enriched flavonoids contents for their antiseptic properties and to develop eco-friendly and effective hand sanitizers as compared to chemical formulations.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kg005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Natural hand rubs</kwd><kwd>Human health friendly</kwd><kwd>Indigenous herbal plants</kwd><kwd>Bio-antiseptics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0005">Novel corona virus (COVID-19) pandemic disease blowout by new corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from People Republic China (<xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2020</xref>).

id="s0090"><label>4</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0115">During COVID-19 pandemic hand hygiene considered prime among preventive measures. WHO recommended alcoholic hand sanitizers have been reported to cause hazard to environment and human health. CDC has raised a serious concern on alcoholic hand sanitizers exposure and 36.7% increased alcoholic hand sanitizers exposure cases have been noticed in USA as compared to early three months exposure in 2018 and 2019. Similarly, alcoholic hand sanitizer exposures to children under age of 12&#x000a0;years have also been raised considerably. Hand hygiene is basic need during COVID-19, especially during outdoors hand sanitizers meet this need. Alcohol free and herbal hand sanitizers are easy to formulate and have better results compared with the alcoholic hand rubs. Easily available herbal plants used to prepare hand sanitizers with accurate efficacy to reduce microbial load from hands are reported in this article. Formulations and preparations of human health and environmental friendly hand sanitizers are communicated to scientific society and common people for benefits. There should be detailed investigation on eco-friendly/herbal sanitizers based on their antiseptic properties to replace the existing chemical based hand rubs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Declaration of Competing Interest</title><p id="p0125">The author declares no conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bi005"><title>References</title><ref id="b0005"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="h0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abbiw</surname><given-names>D.K.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Useful plants of Ghana-West African use of wild and cultivated plants</article-title><source>Intermediate Technol.
