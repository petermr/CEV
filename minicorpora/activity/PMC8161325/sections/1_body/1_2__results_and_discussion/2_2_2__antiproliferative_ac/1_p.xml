<p>The influence of essential oil and hydrosol of the species 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>veronense</italic> on the proliferation of cancer cells has been studied. As far as we know, no one has investigated the antiproliferative effect of the hydrosol of this traditional medicinal plant. In the literature, we found only one study on the cytotoxic activity of the aqueous extract of a species of the genus 
 <italic>Hypericum</italic>, namely 
 <italic>H. scabrum</italic>, against three cancer cell lines: MCF-7, HCT-116 and LNCaP [

 <sub>50</sub> = 8.3%), HCT116 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 8.81%) and U2OS (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 7.05%) (
