<p>The antioxidant capacity of the extracts was assessed by the DPPH method previously outlined by Brand-Williams et al. [
 <xref rid="B75-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. This method was adapted due to small amount of the sample to 96-well microtiter plates method previously used by Mensor et al. [
 <xref rid="B76-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] and Payet et al. [
 <xref rid="B77-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. This method uses 96-well microtiter plates for the reaction of reduction of alcoholic DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) solution (Sigma–Aldrich) in the presence of a hydrogen-donating antioxidant. Plant extracts as described in the ORAC method were used (acetone dissolved essential oils and absolute hydrosols). After the final step of adding 100 µL of a methanolic solution of DPPH (200 µM) to each well, the reaction begins and the initial absorbance was measured immediately at 517 nm using MetOH as a blank value. After 30 and 60 min of incubation, the absorbance was measured again and the percentage of DPPH inhibition was calculated according to the following formula by Yen and Duh [
 <xref rid="B78-plants-10-01014" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]: % inhibition = ((AC(0) − AA(t))/AC(0)) × 100, where AC(0) is the absorbance of the control at 
 <italic>t</italic> = 0 min, and AA(t) is the absorbance of the antioxidant at 
 <italic>t</italic> = 1 h. All measurements were performed in triplicate. Results were expressed as percentage (%) of inhibition and IC50 values in mg/mL.
