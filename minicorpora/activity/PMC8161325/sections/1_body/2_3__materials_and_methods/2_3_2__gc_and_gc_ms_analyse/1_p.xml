<p>Dried aerial parts (80 g) of the plant material were subjected to hydrodistillation for 3 h in a Clevenger-type apparatus. We collected the fractions of lipophilic (essential oil, EO) and hydrophilic volatile compounds (extracted in the pentane and water fractions, respectively, in the inner tube of the Clevenger apparatus) and stored them in the refrigerator until analysis. Both phases were analyzed by GC and GC-MS. Gas chromatography (GC) was performed using a gas chromatograph (model 3900; Varian Inc., Lake Forest, CA, USA) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID), a mass spectrometer (model 2100T; Varian Inc.), a nonpolar capillary column VF-5ms (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., coating thickness 0.25 μm, Varian, Lake Forest, CA, USA) and a polar CP Wax 52 CB (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., coating thickness 0.25 μm) was equipped. The chromatographic conditions for both fractions were: FID detector temperature 300 °C, injector temperature 250 °C, the carrier gas was helium at 1 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>. The conditions for the columns were: VF-5ms (temperature 60 °C isothermal for 3 min, then increased to 246 °C at a rate of 3 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup>, and held isothermal for 25 min) and for the CP Wax 52 column (temperature 70 °C isothermal for 5 min, then increased to 240 °C at a rate of 3 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup>, and held isothermal for 25 min). The injected volume was 2 μL and the split ratio was 1:20. The MS conditions were: ion source temperature 200 °C, ionization voltage 70 eV, mass scan range 40–350 mass units [

The 2 g of hydrosol was added to the glass bottle and sealed with a metal cap with septum. The headspace needle was injected into the glass bottle sealed with a metal cap with septum. The glass bottle was first placed in 40 °C water with the hydrosol sample and left there for 20 min without the needle to allow the volatile compounds to evaporate from the water. The needle was then injected and left there for 20 min to allow the volatile compounds to adsorb onto the resin needle. The injection needle was then inserted into a GC inlet and left there for 20 min to ensure that all volatile compounds were reabsorbed from the resin into the injection liner. Individual peaks for all samples were identified by comparing their retention indices of n-alkanes with those of authentic samples and literature [
