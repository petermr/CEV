<p>It is important to highlight that the culinary and medicinal use of some

 <italic>.</italic>, 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic>, 
 <italic>N. damascena</italic>, and 
 <italic>N. arvensis</italic>) suggests that their consumption is safe. The seeds are characterized by a low toxicity degree (

 <xref rid="B157" ref-type="bibr">Namazi et al., 2018</xref>), but more studies were focused on
