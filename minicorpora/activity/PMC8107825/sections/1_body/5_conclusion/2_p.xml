<p>When referring to clinical trials, it seems that the supplementation of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> can exert some effects on diabetes, obesity, and hypertension, among others. Nonetheless, the administration way (seeds, powder, oil, etc.), the dose and the treatment period are highly variable and should be further established from a therapeutic point of view, as well the chemical and phytochemical composition. This should be further study in order to formulate functional ingredients/nutraceuticals to promote the health benefit and how should be added into food. Moreover, besides the pleiotropic health applications of 
 <italic>Nigella</italic>, it can be useful in nanotechnology applications as well as to modulate the activity of other therapeutic agents.
