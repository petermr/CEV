 <italic>Nigella</italic> seeds and extracts have a wide range of bioactivities, which have been demonstrated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Nonetheless, 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> is the most studied species probably due to their popularity in folklore medicine. In all cases, future perspectives should be oriented to perform a better characterization of the constituents of the extracts since most studies were only focused on determining the concentration of thymoquinone, but other phytochemicals could be present as in this review more than 80 compounds have been reported. This is also important to remark that bioavailability could affect the way that 
 <italic>Nigella</italic> components act 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, e.g., some studies administered 
 <italic>Nigella</italic> products orally, while other intravenously.
