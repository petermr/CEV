<p>The oil of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds has been highly studied, showing predominance of linoleic acid (1) (50â€“60%), oleic acid (2) (20%), myristic acid (3) (30%), and palmitic acid (4) (12.5%) (

 <italic>Nigella</italic> seed oil from Morocco also showed that the major fatty acids were linoleic acid (1) (58.5 and 56.5%), oleic acid (2) (23.8 and 24.9%) and palmitic acid (4) (13.1 and 11.9%) using cold press and solvent extraction, respectively (

 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds from other Mediterranean countries. These fatty acids were also reported as major compounds from the seed oils, extracted by 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, of different 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> genotypes from India (

 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seed from Turkey and Egypt obtained by supercritical CO
 <sub>2</sub> extraction were similar in fatty acid composition of saturated fatty acids (16%), mainly constituted by palmitic acid (4) and stearic acid (5); monounsaturated acids (23%), mainly oleic acid and 
 <italic>cis</italic>-vaccenic acid (6), and polyunsaturated acids (58%), mainly linoleic acid (1) and eicosadienoic acid (7) (
