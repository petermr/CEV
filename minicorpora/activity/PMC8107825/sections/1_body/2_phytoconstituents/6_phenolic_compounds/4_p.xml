<p>A recent study has shown that there are qualitative and quantitative differences between the phenolic compounds of ethanolic extracts from 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> and 
 <italic>N. damascena</italic> seeds (
 <xref rid="B202" ref-type="bibr">Toma et al., 2015</xref>). For example, quercitrin (59) was detected in both extracts, hyperoside (60) and quercetin (38) in 
 <italic>N. damascena</italic>, while kaempferol (37) was found only in 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic>. Moreover, a recent study has reported a more complex phenolic profile, which was found complexed with 
 <italic>N. damascena</italic> seeds proteins: gallic acid (47), protocatechuic acid (61), 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (62), vanillic acid (48), (+)-catechin (51), caffeic acid (63), chlorogenic acid (52), syringic acid (49), (â€“)-epicatechin (50), 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid (53), sinapic acid (64), hesperidin (65), quercetin 38) and kaempferol (37).
