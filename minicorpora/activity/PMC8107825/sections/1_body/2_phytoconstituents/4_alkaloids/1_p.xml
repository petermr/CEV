<p>The bio-potential of nitrogen-containing heterocycles has been recently revised (
 <xref rid="B227" ref-type="bibr">Thakral and Singh, 2019</xref>). In plants, alkaloids contain one or more nitrogen atoms and usually are situated in some cyclic system. Similarly, these nitrogen-containing heterocycles, such as isoquinoline alkaloids and their 
 <italic>N</italic>-oxides, can be a source of leads for drug discovery (
 <xref rid="B225" ref-type="bibr">Dembitskya et al., 2015</xref>). This included compound such as nigellimine (23) and nigellimine-
 <italic>N</italic>-oxide (24) from 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds. This species also contains other type of alkaloids such as nigellicine (25), and nigellidine-4-
 <italic>O</italic>-sulfite (26) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Nigellidine (27) and its derivative methyl nigellidine, higenamine (28), and nigeglanine (29) were also characterized in 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Atta Ur et al., 1995</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B220" ref-type="bibr">Yun et al., 2014</xref>). Among them, methyl nigellidine, nigeglanoside and nigelloside could be used as markers to differentiate both species (
 <xref rid="B220" ref-type="bibr">Yun et al., 2014</xref>).
