<p>The essential oil composition is highly variable and probably more chemotypes exist. As an example, 
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">Jrah Harzallah et al. (2011)</xref> identified eighty-four compounds in the essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds from Tunisia and the major one was the monoterpenes 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (9) (49.48%), α-thujene (15) (18.93%), α-pinene (16) (5.44%), β-pinene (16) (4.31%). Alternatively, the bioactive compound thymoquinone represented only 0.79%. Similar results were found by 
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">Geng et al. (2009)</xref>; 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds contained 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (9) (33.75%) as the major component using the hydrodestillation mode, with low content of thymoquinone (8) (3.73%), while using supercritical CO
 <sub>2</sub> extraction the major one was linoleic acid (1). Another study reported that 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds from Tunisia and Morocco showed again that 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (9) occurred in a higher relative concentration (60.5 and 56.7%, respectively) (

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Badri et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, the essential oil extracted by hydrodistillation from Egyptian seeds showed the major components were 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (9) (33.0%) and thymoquinone (8) (32.2%), followed by α-thujene (15) (13.0%) and camphene (19) (2.9%) (
 <xref rid="B209" ref-type="bibr">Viuda-Martos et al., 2011</xref>). Rarely, the composition of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds essential oil from Poland showed that two other monoterpenoids were present: 
 <italic>cis</italic>- and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-4-methoxythujane (18) (
 <xref rid="B211" ref-type="bibr">Wajs et al., 2008</xref>). 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Bourgou et al. (2012)</xref> has identified also four terpenoids, 
 <italic>trans/cis</italic>-sabinene hydrate methyl ether (20), 1,2-epoxy-menth-4-ene (21), and 1,2-epoxy-menth-4(8)-ene (22), in Tunisian 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> essential oil from seeds by nuclear magnetic resonance (
