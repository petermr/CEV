 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> powder supplementation (1 g/day) for sixty days caused momentous reductions in concentrations of LDL, TG levels and enhancement in HDL level in hypercholesterolemic patients (
 <xref rid="B196" ref-type="bibr">Tasawar et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 4-weeks trial showed that the administration of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds (1g/day) can reduce total cholesterol and LDL. Thus, it can be interesting as lowering lipid agent in hyperlipidaemic subjects (

 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> oil (3 g/day for 8 weeks) was also tested in a low-calorie diet on cardiometabolic risk factors in obese women. Compared to the placebo group, in the 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> treated group, weight (−6.0%) and WC (−6.9%) decreased. It also favored a reduction in triglyceride and LDL levels (

 <italic>N. sativa</italic> on some anthropometric indices in adult subjects. It indicated that 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> supplementation exerts a moderate effect on reduction in BW (−2.11 kg), BMI (−1.16 kg/m
 <sup>2</sup>) and WC (−3.52 cm) (
 <xref rid="B157" ref-type="bibr">Namazi et al., 2018</xref>). Nonetheless, other meta-analysis performed till January 2018 suggested that 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> supplementation have only an effect on BW (−1.76 kg) and BMI (−0.85 kg/m
 <sup>2</sup>) in adults compared to placebo (
