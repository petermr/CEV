<p>The possibility of application of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seed in patients with metabolic syndrome was firstly investigated by 
 <xref rid="B155" ref-type="bibr">Najmi et al. (2008)</xref>. They found that the administration with 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seed oil (2.5 mL twice a day for 6 weeks) in patients with metabolic syndrome significantly decreased FBG and LDL and increased HDL levels. The same group of authors (
 <xref rid="B156" ref-type="bibr">Najmi et al., 2012</xref>) analyzed the effect of supplementation with powdered 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seed (500 mg/day for two months) in patients with low glycemic control (glycate hemoglobin—HbA1C was lower than 7%). As a result, in the intervention group significant lowering of FBG, postprandial blood glucose (PPBG) and HbA1c was observed.
