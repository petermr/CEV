 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">Hosseini et al. (2013)</xref> investigated anti-hyperglycemic effect of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seed oil in type II diabetic patients. As a result of supplementation with 5 mL of oil/day for three months, blood levels of fasting and 2 h PPBG, as well as HbA1c were significantly decreased compared to placebo group. This hypoglycemic effect can be result of an insulin senzitation and stimulation of pancreatic beta-cell function, resulting in intensified activity and consequent decrease in glucose level. Moreover, 
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">Kaatabi et al. (2015)</xref> reported pronounced antidiabetic activity after three-month application of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> powdered seed (2 g/day) in combination with oral hypoglycemic agent in patients with type 2 diabetes. In this study, 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> received group showed significant reduction of FBG, HbA1C, and TBARS, and at the same time noticeable increase of the total antioxidant capacity, SOD, and glutathione levels were recorded in the intervention group. 
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">Heshmati et al. (2015)</xref> investigated effect of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seed oil application (3 g/day) on glucose metabolism and lipid concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes. According to this study, FBG, HbA1C, and levels of triglycerides (TG) and LDL significantly changed in the intervention group compared to the placebo one. On the other hand, insulin level and its resistance decreased and HDL increased in the intervention group, but after adjusting for confounder factors, these parameters were not significant. Overall, the potential antidiabetic mechanisms of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> could be mediated through a change in the oxidative status (either via upregulation of endogenous antioxidants or reduction of oxidative species), reduction of inflammation, and improvement of lipid profiles (

 <italic>N. sativa</italic> could be a suitable choice to manage the complications of type 2 diabetes, including FBS (−17.84 mg/dL), HbA1c (−0.71%), total cholesterol (−22.99 mg/dL), and LDL (−22.38 mg/dL) (
