<p>There are several clinical studies reporting positive effect of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> application on hypertension. 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Dehkordi and Kamkhah (2008)</xref> demonstrated that application of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds extract (100 and 200 mg for eight weeks) in patients with mild hypertension led to significant reduction of systolic and diastolic BP compared to placebo. At the same time, a significant decrease in total and LDL cholesterol was observed and no other complications caused by the treatment were found. Similar results were obtained for 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seed oil. 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Fallah Huseini et al. (2013)</xref> exhibited that its application in a dose 2.5 mL two times per day for 8 weeks reduced systolic and dyastolic BP in healthy volunteers. Authors suggested that the exhibited effect could be attributed to the activity of thymoquinone (8), one of main constituents of the volatile oil from 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seed, as commented before.
