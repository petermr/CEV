 <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">Kolahdooz et al. (2014)</xref> studied effect of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seed oil on abnormal semen quality in infertile man. These authors showed that the daily application of 5Â mL for two months significantly improved sperm count, morphology and motility and volume of semen, pH, and number of round cells. The exact mechanism of the exhibited effect is not determined, but it is likely related to strong antioxidant activity of the oil. Namely, it is well known that high level of oxidative stress contributes to decreased semen quality (
