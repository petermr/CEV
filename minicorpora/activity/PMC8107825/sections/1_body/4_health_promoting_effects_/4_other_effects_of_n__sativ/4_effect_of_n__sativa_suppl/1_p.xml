<p>Several clinical trials demonstrated positive effects of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> application in resolving symptoms related to some skin diseases. 
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">Ghorbanibirgani et al. (2014)</xref> showed positive effects of 6 months topical application of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> oil on vitiligo lesions compared to fish oil according to Vitiligo Area Scoring Index. In another study, 
 <xref rid="B219" ref-type="bibr">Yousefi et al. (2013)</xref> investigated the therapeutic potential of 2% ointment topically applied (twice/day during 4 weeks) in patients with hand eczema compared to eucerin and betamethasone. According to scores obtained using Hand Eczema Severity index and Dermatology Life Quality Index, they showed that 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> ointment could have the same efficacy as betamethasone, while it is more efficient compared to eucerin. 
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">Jawad et al. (2014)</xref> investigated effect of various preparations of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> in psoriasis treatment. A first group has been receiving 
 <italic>Nigella</italic> ointment topically (10% w/w, twice daily), the second group took crude pulverized plant (capsules with 500 mg three times daily), while the third group received the combination of both treatments. The inspected reaction has been estimated following the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score, while MDA serum level was used as indicator of the oxidative stress. After 12 weeks of treatment ointment reached total healing of psoriatic lesions, with good response in 65% of patients, and a relapse rate of 31% four weeks after cessation of treatment. Oral doses of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> developed good response in 50% of patients, with a relapse rate of 50% observed four weeks after application. The combination of ointment and oral doses gained best results—total cure of lesions, and good responses in 85% of patients, with a relapse rate of 18%. All of these positive effects of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> in dermatological diseases could be attributed to its antimicrobial, antioxidant, immunomodulatory, and anti-inflammatory effects.
