 <xref rid="B172" ref-type="bibr">Rezaeian and Amoushahi Khouzani (2018)</xref> investigated the effect of

 <italic>N. sativa</italic> nasal spray (i.e. 1 g/day of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic>) and in the placebo group received 2 puffs/day of sodium chloride spray (0.65%). Lund–McKay, Lund Kennedy, and Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 scores were used and the outcomes were significantly lower in the intervention group compared to the placebo group. These findings are in line with previous reports about the antihistamine properties of
