<p>HT is one of the most common human autoimmune diseases influencing the thyroid glands and an organ-specific T-cell mediated disease (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Chistiakov, 2005</xref>). The disease is ten times more frequent in women than in men and it affects 2% of general population. HT is associated with serious alterations in composition and the transport of lipoproteins. Several clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> application in patients with HT. According to the study conducted by 
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Farhangi et al. (2016)</xref>, the application of powdered 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds (2Â g) for eight weeks significantly decreased BW and BMI compared to placebo. Also, a positive effect has been achieved on thyroid function. A decrease in the serum concentrations of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) has been shown, while serum concentrations of T3 increased in 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> treated group. In the same study, significant reduction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was noted in the intervention group. It has been observed that its concentration grows during pathological states characterized by increased TSH secretion (
