<p>Clinical studies have mostly confirmed some effects of the seeds of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> and their derivatives (seed extract and seed oil) obtained in the aforementioned 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> animal studies. Particularly, in the on line database about clinical trials “
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>”, there are 16 studies on 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic>. Among them, the status of four studies on blood lipids, obesity and diabetes management has been completed, while other two were about palmer arsenical keratosis and asthma. The administration of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds (or seeds oil/extract) was alone or with other herbal substances (e.g., 
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> extract), with different dosages and up to 60 days. Some of the results were positive, e.g. in total cholesterol and asthma, and subject of publications (
