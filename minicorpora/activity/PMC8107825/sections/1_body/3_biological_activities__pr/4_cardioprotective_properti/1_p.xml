 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> has a high potential for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases, while little is known about the cardiovascular properties of other 
 <italic>Nigella</italic> species. As an example, 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds powder improved lipid profile and prevented atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic rabbits when it was supplied in their diet (5%). It significantly decreased fatty streak formation, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (

 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds (100–400 mg/kg) for six weeks reduced serum glucose and lipids, while it improved atherogenic index of plasma, vasoreactivity, endothelial dysfunction, and vascular inflammation (

 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> (seed, oil and extracts) has a potential role in the management of hypertension, as shown 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> (

 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abbasnezhad et al., 2019</xref>) and

 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">Leong et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Enayatfard et al., 2018</xref>) due to vasorelaxant properties. It also may increase endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, attenuate cardiovascular effects of the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II, and inhibit the parasympathetic tone (
