<p>Thymoquinone is one of the potential active compounds in 
 <italic>Nigella</italic>, as commented before (

 <xref rid="B190" ref-type="bibr">Siveen et al., 2014</xref>;

 <sub>50</sub> = 46 μM) by: enhanced caspase-3 enzyme activity, decreased MDA contents, induced cell apoptosis, and inhibited cell growth (
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">Ismail et al., 2018</xref>). This compound also revealed to be a potential therapeutic adjuvant in human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 64.93 µM, and T47D, IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 165 µM). In other cases, thymoquinone in combination with anti-cancer drugs, can exhibit antagonistic and synergistic effects (

 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Phytoconstituents</xref>” section, 
 <italic>Nigella</italic> genus is a rich source of phytochemicals, including dithymoquinone (10), thymohydroquinone (11), carvacrol (12), thymol (13), nigellimine-
 <italic>N</italic>-oxide (24), nigellicine (25), nigellidine (27), which may contribute to the anticancer properties (see reviews by

 <xref rid="B176" ref-type="bibr">Salehi et al., 2019</xref>). 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Edris (2009)</xref> also remarked that β-elemene (17), which is one of the most abundant compounds in 
 <italic>Nigella</italic> species like 
 <italic>N. orientalis</italic>, 
 <italic>N. damascena,</italic> and 
 <italic>N. arvensis</italic>, has also anti-cancer properties. Moreover, recent studies suggest that 
 <italic>Nigella</italic> saponins, including α-hederin (30), nigella A (31) and B (32), have an anti-cancer protective role (

 <xref rid="B173" ref-type="bibr">Rooney and Ryan, 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B200" ref-type="bibr">Tian et al., 2006</xref>). Remarkably, nigella A (31) and B (32) (40 mg/kg, intragastric administration), extracted from 
 <italic>N. sativa,</italic> inhibited tumor growth in nude mice by 42.82 and 37.20%, respectively, when compared with vehicle-administered animals (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, phenolic derivatives isolated in the seeds of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic>, salfredin B11 (79), nigephenol A (80) and B (81), and nigephenol C (82) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>), showed inhibition against HepG2 cells (
 <xref rid="B193" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). Globally, seeds, their extracts and essential oils from 
 <italic>Nigella</italic> are complex sources of anti-cancer compounds, whose level and synergism/antagonism require further study.
