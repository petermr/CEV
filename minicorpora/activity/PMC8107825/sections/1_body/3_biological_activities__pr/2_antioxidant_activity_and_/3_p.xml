<p>Nonetheless, other

 <italic>Trans</italic>-anethole (14), isolated from the essential oil of

Moreover, in oxidative stress induced experimental subjects, thymol (12) (thymol 10Â mg/kg) has been shown significant impact on sperm quality via increasing the spermatozoa concentration and motility, and lowering the MDA level. It also decreases the dead sperm ratio and enhances the glutathione concentrations in the testicles, liver and kidney tissues (
