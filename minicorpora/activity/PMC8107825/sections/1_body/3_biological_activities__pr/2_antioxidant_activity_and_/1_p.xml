<p>Some studies suggest that 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> oil and extracts have antioxidant properties and can modulate oxidative stress, which could be beneficial for oxidative stress related diseases/disorders. In this sense, oils and solvent extracts from 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds possessed antioxidant activity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (

 <xref rid="B146" ref-type="bibr">Mohammed et al., 2016</xref>;

 <italic>ex vivo</italic> (
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Ghoreyshi et al., 2020</xref>), 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">Mahmoudi et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B171" ref-type="bibr">Rasoli et al., 2018</xref>) and in humans (
 <xref rid="B161" ref-type="bibr">Nikkhah-Bodaghi et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> regular intake of ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seed (400 mg/kg) lowered the lipid peroxidation, and enhanced catalase activity in Wistar rats (
 <xref rid="B171" ref-type="bibr">Rasoli et al., 2018</xref>). Another work suggested that hydroalcoholic and hexane extracts of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seed as well as thymoquinone may counteract oxidative stress caused by high-fat diets (HFDs), e.g. malondialdehyde (MDA) levels decreased, while the activity of catalase enzyme and serum total antioxidant capacity increased (
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">Mahmoudi et al., 2018</xref>). Concerning other 
 <italic>Nigella</italic> species, 
 <italic>N. damacena</italic> 70% ethanolic extract (seeds) has shown antioxidant properties 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, even higher generally than 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds (
 <xref rid="B202" ref-type="bibr">Toma et al., 2015</xref>); the former contained higher amounts of quercetin derivatives. Also, the fixed oil from the seeds of another species, 
 <italic>Nigella unguicularis</italic> Spenner, showed favorable oxidant/antioxidant balance and blood lipids profile when it was administered to rats (1 ml/kg orally for 4 weeks) (
 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">Kökdil et al., 2005</xref>). However, the responsible active compounds were not determined in the latter case.
