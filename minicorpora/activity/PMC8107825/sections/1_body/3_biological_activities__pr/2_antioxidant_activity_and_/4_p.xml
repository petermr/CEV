<p>It should be notice that polar extracts from 
 <italic>Nigella</italic> could have a wide spectrum of other phenolic compounds, which are antioxidant in nature (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4-5">section 4.5</xref>), and thus it should be taken into account in further studies. As an example, free and bound phenolic compounds, which were associated to 
 <italic>N. damascena</italic> and 
 <italic>N. arvensis</italic> proteins from the seeds, have shown antioxidant properties 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Alu'datt et al., 2016</xref>). As noted before, 
 <italic>N. damascena</italic> seeds contain quercetin derivatives, including quercetin aglycone, hyperoside and quercitrin, as well as the total phenolic content showed enhanced antioxidant properties (
 <xref rid="B202" ref-type="bibr">Toma et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, total saponins from 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds increased the plasma superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities and decreased MDA level compared to control group in 
 <sc>d</sc>-galactose-induced aging model (6–24 mg/kg). These seeds also showed (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) DPPH radical scavenging properties (
