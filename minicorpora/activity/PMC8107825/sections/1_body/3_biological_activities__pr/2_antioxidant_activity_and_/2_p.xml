<p>As commented before, thymoquinone can have a protective role against oxidative stress (
 <xref rid="B212" ref-type="bibr">Woo et al., 2013</xref>). Thymoquine has shown antioxidant properties 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, in particular using the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (
 <xref rid="B198" ref-type="bibr">Tesarova et al., 2011</xref>). Essential oil extracted from 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds with higher thymoquinone content showed stronger antioxidant activity than other essential oils (

 <xref rid="B205" ref-type="bibr">Usta and Dede (2017)</xref> assessed role of thymoquinone on oxidative DNA damage and NF-κB levels in diabetic rats. The results revealed that the oxidative DNA damage (8 hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine) and NF-κB levels were insignificantly lowered after treatment. Moreover, it also reduced glycosylated hemoglobin, glucose levels and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activities. In recent 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies, thymoquinone in combination with iron oxide nanoparticles showed attenuation in genetic and oxidative damage, and caused an enhancement in the levels of anti-oxidant enzymes (
