 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> could play a role against diabetes and obesity, and thereby it could be an interesting agent to treat/prevent the metabolic syndrome. In cell 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, the ethanol extract from 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds has shown antidiabetic activity using adipocytes (

 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Benhaddou-Andaloussi et al., 2010</xref>). In particular, it was able to activate the AMPK pathway and the insulin signaling pathway, as well as it acted as an agonist of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARγ) (

 <italic>N. sativa</italic>, which contained compounds such as thymoquinone (8), anethole (14), 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (9), saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, had also antidiabetic properties 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. In this concern, 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> oil (500 mg/kg/day) was co-administered orally along with high-fructose water (20%, w/v) for 45 days. It was able to reduce fructose-induced insulin resistance by reduction of hepatic insulin-degrading enzyme protein and activation of insulin receptor signaling. It also decreased body weight (BW), serum lipids, and glucagon (

 <italic>n</italic>-hexane and petroleum ether from the seeds of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> has shown inhibitory properties against protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B, with half maximal inhibitory concentration values of 33.15 and 18.50 μg/mL, respectively. This could be another mechanism of action since this enzyme is involved in the down regulation of insulin and leptin signaling and thus this plant could have antidiabetic potential (
