<p>The role of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> and its components as promising neuropharmacological agents (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Beheshti et al., 2016</xref>) in facitilating learning and memory have been recently reviewed (
 <xref rid="B174" ref-type="bibr">Sahak et al., 2016</xref>). In rats, 1 ml/kg of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> oil for 14 days depleted reactive oxygen species (ROS)/NO levels, improved neurogenic proteins, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities and neuro-cognitive markers depletions in chlopyrifos exposure (
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">Imam et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> oil improved neurocognicives indices such as Morris water maze. In other study performed in rats, the hydroalcoholic extracts of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds (200 and 400 mg/kg, 5 days) were used to investigate its effects on memory and brain tissues oxidative damage in penthylenetetrazole-induced repeated seizures (
 <xref rid="B207" ref-type="bibr">Vafaee et al., 2015</xref>). The results showed a beneficial effects of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> on learning and memory impairments (Morris water maze) and improved antioxidant effects in the rat brain (lower MDA levels).
