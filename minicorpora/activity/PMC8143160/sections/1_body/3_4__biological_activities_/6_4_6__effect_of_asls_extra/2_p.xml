<p>Extracts from the natural sources are rich in bioactive compounds and perform numerous biological activities, which is key for the formulation of pharmaceutical drugs and innovative food products rich in antioxidants. ASLs have been grossly studied for their health promoting effects using in vivo ad in vitro experiments. However, to establish ASLs as an active ingredient in pharma- and food industry, more clinical trials must be conducted. Furthermore, ASL extracts have been proven to be cytotoxic against cancerous cells, but its toxicity needs more exhaustive studies on the normal cells. Vast molecular diversity of the ASLs have potential to treat other ailments in humans, which needs further attention of the researchers.</p>
