For the treatment of DM, numerous oral hypoglycaemic medicinal compounds, such as sulfonylurea (glimepiride), thiazolidinedione (rosiglitazone), and biguanides, are available in addition to insulin. However, counterfeit medicinal compounds have led to critical complications in patients and are harmful to pregnant women [
