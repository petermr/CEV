<p>The natural metabolite palmitone purified from leaf cuticular wax of 
 <italic>Annona squamosa</italic> showed higher antibacterial activity (MIC: 6.24–12.6 µg/mL) than its individual isomeric hydroxyl ketones, i.e., 11-hydroxy-16-hentriacontanone and 10-hydroxy-16-hentriacontanone (MIC: 20–52 µg/mL). For a compound to penetrate the bacterial cell wall, the lipophilicity of the cell wall and the specific compound need to be mutually compatible. Palmitone is a symmetrical ketone compound compared to hydroxy palmitones, and therefore, has a greater penetration ability and higher antimicrobial activity [

The antimicrobial mechanism of action of leaf extracts can be attributed to the major contributors, i.e., phenolic compounds, which induce disruption of the microbial membrane, coagulation of cytoplasmic components, and cytoplasmic leakage, interfering with microbial cellular metabolism and adapting anti-quorum sensing activity [

A study on the prospective role and applications of ASL extract in the prevention of foodborne bacterial disease indicates that the extract has broad-spectrum but heat-labile activity against foodborne bacterial pathogens because of its ability to scavenge H

Detailed research should be performed to explore the myriad of bioactive compounds that combine to give the leaf extract its therapeutic value, their mechanisms of action and more potential benefits of using ASLs as natural food preservatives.
