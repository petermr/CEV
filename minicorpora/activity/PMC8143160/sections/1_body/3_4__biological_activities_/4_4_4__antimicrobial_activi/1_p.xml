<p>Plant-based antimicrobials have substantial prophylactic properties and are considered to be efficient, safe, and cost-effective alternatives for synthetic antimicrobials that possess more notable side effects. Despite being a commercial fruit plant because of its creamy succulent flesh, 
 <italic>Annona squamosa</italic> is reported to have enormous pharmacological properties, including antimicrobial activity, owing to the presence of different secondary metabolites, such as glycosides, phytosterols, alkaloids, oils, saponins, phenols, and flavonoids [
 <xref rid="B85-biomolecules-11-00614" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. In several research studies, the leaf extracts of 
 <italic>Annona squamosa</italic> were identified to have remarkable antibacterial activity and antifungal activities. Significant antimicrobial activities were exhibited by an active acetogenin compound known as annotemoyin isolated from chloroform leaf extract and by certain flavonoid compounds purified from aqueous leaf extract of the plant [

LC-MS/MS analysis of ASL extracts from plants growing in drylands identified the presence of metabolites, including ephedradine A, ergosine, mudanpioside H, and trichosanic acid, exhibiting significant antifungal activity. The same extract was found to inhibit bacterial growth at a concentration of 8–11 µg, and the compound mudanpioside H was possibly responsible for this antibacterial activity [

 <italic>Annona squamosa</italic> was performed against two gram-positive 
 <italic>(S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic>) and two gram-negative (
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>) bacteria, indicating that the highest zone of inhibition was observed against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 131 µg/mL, followed by petroleum ether extract against P. aeruginosa with an MIC of 164 µg/mL and methanol extract against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> with an MIC of 179 µg/mL. Here, phytochemical studies proved that some of the essential oil compounds, such as linalool, borneol, eugenol, farnesol, and geraniol, present in the leaf extracts contributed to the antibacterial activity [
