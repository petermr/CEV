<p>Leaves of 
 <italic>Annona squamosa</italic> have a number of chemical compounds belonging to diverse groups, including phenolics, annonaceous acetogenins, saponins, flavonoids, alkaloids, glycosides, alkaloids, steroids, and terpenoids [

 <xref rid="B40-biomolecules-11-00614" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Leaf extract at a concentration of 100 Âµg/mL exhibited strong cytotoxic and antiproliferative activities against breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231). The extracts showed a persistent induction of apoptosis and reduction in wound closure. The authors indicated that the anticancer effects could result from the cell cycle arrest of MCF-7 cells at G1 phase and inhibition of their migration to other parts of the body [

The inhibition of these cell lines could also be attributable to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, DNA fragmentation, and nuclear condensation, resulting from the downregulation of the ratio of Bcl-2 (apoptosis regulator) and Bax (induce apoptosis by instigating the release of mitochondrial cytochrome C). Additionally, the activation of Caspase-3 stimulates the expression of a number of microRNA species that target Bcl-2.
