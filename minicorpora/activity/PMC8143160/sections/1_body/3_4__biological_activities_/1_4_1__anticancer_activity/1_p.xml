<p>The ability to evade apoptosis is a unique property of human cancers that can result in effective cancer progression and tumour formation. The high resistance of cancer cells to apoptosis against a pertinent stimulus is a critical rationale underlying therapy failure. Hence, a number of cancer treatment strategies, including radiation therapy and chemotherapy, are primarily based on cancer cell apoptosis [

A long history of using natural products as ethnomedicines, which are inexpensive and have minimal side effects, in contrast to exorbitant synthetic drugs with deleterious effects, has instigated the development of natural pharmaceutical drugs [
