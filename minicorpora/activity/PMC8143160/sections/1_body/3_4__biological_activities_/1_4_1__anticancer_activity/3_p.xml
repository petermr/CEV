<p>In another study, silver nanoparticles were synthesised by ASL extract (As-Ag NPs) and tested for their anticancer activity against the HeLa (cervical) cancer cell line [
 <xref rid="B58-biomolecules-11-00614" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The results indicated that these As-Ag NPs exhibited strong apoptotic action against HeLa cancer cells. This could result from atypical protein signalling and ROS induction, causing oxidative stress and subsequently inducing apoptosis and cell death [

 <xref rid="B56-biomolecules-11-00614" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The IC50 value against WiDr cells was estimated to be 292.39 Âµg/mL. The extracts were found to significantly increase the expression of caspase-3, Bax and bad genes, causing an arrested cell cycle at the G2/M phase and induction of WiDr apoptosis.
