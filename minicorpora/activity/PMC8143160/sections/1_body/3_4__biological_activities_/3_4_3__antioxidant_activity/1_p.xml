<p>In the course of metabolic reactions, cells produce free radicals as a byproduct. Free radicals induce oxidative stress in the cell at higher concentrations, which contributes to cell function disruption. Multiple recent studies have shown that deleterious free radicals cause various degenerative diseases, such as diabetes, cancer, and neurodegeneration [

 <xref rid="B82-biomolecules-11-00614" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the methanolic extract of ASLs revealed the presence of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, such as germacrene-D (22.01%), trans-caryophyllene (12.12%), and bicyclogermacrene (2.80%) [

 <xref rid="B42-biomolecules-11-00614" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Several studies were conducted to determine the antioxidant potential of the ASLs. The DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) scavenging activities of ASL extracts in acetone, methanol, and water were reported to have moderate antioxidant activity with an IC50 value of 33.9 ± 4.8 μg/mL for acetone, followed by methanol and aqueous extracts with values of 51 ± 1.6 and 98.3 ± 0.4 μg/mL, respectively [
 <xref rid="B18-biomolecules-11-00614" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Another such study of ASL extracts in methanol and ethanol resulted in IC50 = 13.61 µg/mL and IC50 = 15.97 µg/mL, respectively [
 <xref rid="B72-biomolecules-11-00614" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. The DPPH free radical scavenging activity of ASL extracts in chloroform, methanol, and water reported IC50 values of 308.3 μg/mL, 342.5 μg/mL, and 439.6 μg/mL, respectively. The NO radical scavenging activity of the extracts reported IC50 values of 185.2 mg/mL, 345.8 mg/mL, and 366.3 mg/mL in methanol, chloroform, and water, respectively. The overall study reported that the methanol extract had higher antioxidant activity than chloroform and water, which was attributed to the presence of a large class of phytochemicals that were absent in chloroform and water extracts. The study also reported phenolic compounds as the main antioxidant components [

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> scavenging activity of different solvent extracts of ASL in methanol, acetone, ethanol, and water, where water extracts exhibited higher activity, i.e., 54.06%, at 25 μg/mL than acetone, ethanol, and methanol extracts. The study also reported the correlation coefficient between the total antioxidant activity and total phenolics, which was found to be 0.8965 [
 <xref rid="B3-biomolecules-11-00614" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A previous study attributed the difference in H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> scavenging capacity between the solvent extracts to the structural features of their active components, which determine their electron-donating abilities [
 <xref rid="B73-biomolecules-11-00614" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. In another study ethanolic extract of ASL was reported to have 133.33 and 264.65 μg/mL DPPH and hydroxyl activity, respectively [
 <xref rid="B83-biomolecules-11-00614" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. The authors concluded that polyphenols extracted from the ASL at optimised conditions have excellent antioxidant properties which can be utilised in preparation of functional foods. In a parallel comparative study, methanol and hexane extract of ASL reported IC50 49.64 and 64.01 µg/mL, respectively [
 <xref rid="B84-biomolecules-11-00614" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. The authors also showed that ASL extracts have superior antioxidant properties than bark extracts. In summary, many interesting results indicated the potential of ASL extracts as antioxidants, but little research on the application of these extracts has been reported.
