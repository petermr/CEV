<p>Hepatosteatosis or fatty liver disease (FLD) is mostly caused by an imbalance in the production and metabolisation of fat in the body, which is caused by dietary habits, sedentary lifestyles, and stress. Moreover, several drugs (e.g., paracetamol) are known to cause damage (as a side effect) to hepatocytes. Due to the effect of a high fat dose and the damage caused by drugs, hepatocytes face oxidative stress, which further leads to hepatosteatosis. Drug-induced liver injury has become a major concern for health-related personnel and industry [

Paracetamol is the most common medicine used in the treatment of various diseases, but it has many negative impacts on various body parts. Consumption of paracetamol causes hyperlipidaemia, which is a common sign of liver damage. Rajeshkumar et al. [
 <xref rid="B71-biomolecules-11-00614" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] used paracetamol-treated (2 g/kg b.w.) albino rats to evaluate the hepatoprotective properties of ASLs. The dose of ASL extract (1000 mg/kg body weight (b.w.)) conferred effective protection of hepatic cells by enhancing protein levels and inducing a significant reduction in serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase and serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase levels in serum. The presence of a flavone [5,7,40-trihydroxy-6,30 dimethoxy flavone 3-O-a-L-rhamnopyranoside (THDMF-Rha)] was reported in the ASL extract. At a dose of 5.0 mg/kg b.w., THDMF significantly reduced hepatic lipid peroxidation in L-thyroxine-induced rats [

 <xref rid="B67-biomolecules-11-00614" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. These rats were further treated with ethanolic extract of ASLs (450 mg/kg b.w.), which reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) levels (45.48%), total serum bilirubin (38.82%), alanine aminotransferase (39.51%), and aspartate aminotransferase (11.69%). Moreover, the effect was similar to that of a hepatoprotective compound (silymarin) after 7 days of treatment. The authors speculated that the presence of coumarins may be the chief factor conferring hepatoprotective activity. A significant improvement was observed in islands of Langerhans in rats treated with aqueous and ethanolic extracts at a dose of 300 mg/kg/day [

In the case of diethylnitrosamine (200 mg/kg)-induced swiss albino mice, the levels of glutamyl oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT), glutamyl pyruvate transaminase (GPT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), acid phosphatase (ACP), alpha fetoprotein (AFP), and total bilirubin increased in serum and tissue, and these were significantly reduced following treatment with ASL extract (5 g/kg for 30 days) [
 <xref rid="B69-biomolecules-11-00614" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Upon application at 250 and 500 mg/kg b.w., the ASL methanolic extract significantly decreased the serum concentrations of bilirubin, ALP, aspartate amino transferase (AST), gamma glutamate transpeptidase (Î³-GT), alanine amino transferase (ALT), and TBARS, but increased the total protein concentration in rifampicin-induced male Wistar albino rats [
