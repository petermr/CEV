<p>ASLs exhibit excellent nutraceutical, phytochemical, biological, and pharmacological activities due to the presence of distinct metabolites, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, and other active components. ASLs offer great advantages in terms of being a natural fruit ingredient, nutritional food component, and natural medicinal plant that has been utilised all over the globe for the treatment of numerous acute and chronic ailments, such as diabetes, cardiac, cancer, and immune-related disorders. ASLs offer high nutritional value, consisting of protein, fibre, carbohydrates, and vitamins, for both humans and animals, thus making them a complete food and natural medicinal agent. Furthermore, ASLs contain high amounts of sesquiterpenoids and terpenes, and the chemical profile of ASL shows 43 different compounds that mainly give rise to essential oil. Various phytochemicals present in ASLs include glycosides, phytosterols, proteins, carbohydrates, saponins, tannins, alkaloids, phenols, flavonoids, peptides, and acetogenins. These compounds contribute to numerous bioactivities of ASL extracts, including anticancer, antidiabetic, antioxidant, hepatoprotective, antimicrobial, and lipid-lowering effects. Hence, ASLs are potential cost-effective ingredients for nutraceutical, medicinal, and food applications. The phytochemical and pharmacological activities of ASLs make them an indispensable and essential component for natural medicine, immunity boosters, and health-promoting ingredients. Many studies have considered phytochemical profiles, but few studies are available on the carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids present in ASLs. Exploration of the molecular mechanisms underlying the various bioactivities contributed by ASLs is also necessary. Furthermore, there is a need to develop value-added products from ASLs to improve their utilisation as health-promoting ingredients.</p>
