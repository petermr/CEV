 <italic>Annona squamosa</italic> has been widely grown in India for its fruits, apart from its leaves, stem, and roots, which are also important because they possess nutraceutical and pharmaceutical value. Furthermore, the essential oil extracted from ASLs displays excellent antiparasitic and antimalarial activity [
 <xref rid="B28-biomolecules-11-00614" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Various studies have been conducted to investigate the chemical composition of ASL essential oil (ASLEO). Shade-dried leaves collected from lower regions of the Himalayas yielded 0.13% essential oil through the hydrodistillation method. Altogether, 43 constituents were detected, which represented 88.6% of the total oil extracted from ASLs. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and GC–flame ionisation detection (GC-FID) analyses of ASLEO showed a dominance of sesquiterpenoids (sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, 63.4%, and oxygenated sesquiterpenes, 21.8%) followed by monoterpenes (monoterpene hydrocarbons, 2.0%, and oxygenated monoterpenes, 1.4%). Among the sesquiterpenes, the major constituents were (E)-caryophyllene (15.9%), γ-cadinene (11.2%), and epi-α-cadinol (9.4%) [

 <xref rid="B28-biomolecules-11-00614" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]; carvone (24.9%), diacetyl (9.3%), and linalool (7.7%) were major constituents reported in Egyptian ASLEO [
 <xref rid="B30-biomolecules-11-00614" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; and leaf essential oil from the closely related plant 
 <italic>Annona muricata</italic> from France contained germacrene D (15.7%), β-elemene (12.0%), sabinene (8.8%), and α-pinene/β-pinene (8.1%) as major components [
 <xref rid="B31-biomolecules-11-00614" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. α-Pinene (1.0–11.9%), limonene (0.8–11.7%), and β-caryophyllene (11.6–24.5%) were the major constituents of ASLEO derived from Vietnam [
 <xref rid="B32-biomolecules-11-00614" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. ASLEO is mainly composed of terpenes and sesquiterpenes. It yields approximately 59 chemical compounds, of which β-caryophyllene (31.1%) and δ-cadinene (6.7%) were found to be the major compounds [
 <xref rid="B33-biomolecules-11-00614" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Fresh leaves of 
 <italic>Annona squamosa</italic> yielded 0.12% (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>) essential oil through the hydrodistillation method. Eighteen constituents were identified from the ASLEO by using GC and GC/MS, which represented 86% of the total oil extracted. The northern region of India demonstrates a prevalence of β-caryophyllene (23%) and germacrene D (21.3%), while the major components of ASLEO from the southern region of India are β-cedrene (23.3%) and β-caryophyllene (14.1%) [
