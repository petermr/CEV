<p>In recent years, custard apple cultivation has been gaining much public attention due to the essential oil extracted from its leaves. Kulkarni et al. [
 <xref rid="B60-biomolecules-11-00614" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] investigated the chemical composition of ASL extracts using the gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) technique. They reported sodium benzoate (27.50%), 4,4-dimethylcholertrol (10.30%), 4,4-tert-butylcalix(4)areve (12.34%), stigmasterol acetate (2.92), butyloctylpthalate (9.67%), and isoamylacetyate (2.29%) in ASL extracts. Garg and Gupta [
 <xref rid="B34-biomolecules-11-00614" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] identified 18 compounds from essential oil extracted from ASLs collected from North Indian Plains, which account for 86% of the oil. The major constituents of ASLs oil categorised as β-Caryophyllene (23.0%), germacrene D (21.3%), monoterpene hydrocarbons (2.5%), sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (76.0%) and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (7.1%), β-elemene (7.8%), and bicyclogermacrene (8.5%). Hydro-distillation of ASLs produced red essential oils, with a yield of 0.76% (

Among all, (E)-caryophyllene (27.4%), bicyclogermacrene (10.8%), germacrene D (17.1%), β-elemene (6.2%), (Z)-caryophyllene (7.3%), epi-α-cadinol (4.3%), γ-cadinene (4.2%), δ-elemene (4.1%), and α-humulene (5.7%) were found in higher concentrations.
