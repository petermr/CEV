<p>Kumar et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-biomolecules-11-00614" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] reported the total phenolic content, with a range of 212.8–1478.4 μg/g, in leaf extracts of 30 different 
 <italic>Annona squamosa</italic> genotypes. A total of seven phenolic compounds, including chlorogenic acid (1.84–5 μg/g), quercetin (0.19–1.60 μg/g), gallic acid (0.45–0.89 μg/g), caffeic acid (0.07–2.57 μg/g), ferullic acid (0.72–2.82 μg/g), cinnamic acid (0.02–0.05 μg/g), and salicylic acid (0.64 μg/g), were detected and quantified from the methanolic extract of ASLs. Similarly, various phytochemicals, such as phenols, anthroquinones, saponins, tannins, glycosides, and flavonoids, were reported by Katole et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-biomolecules-11-00614" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] in ASL extracts. In another study, Malik et al. [
 <xref rid="B46-biomolecules-11-00614" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] isolated and characterised rutin (quercetin-3-rhamnosyl glucoside), a flavonoid compound, from ethanolic extracts of ASLs by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and MS techniques. In a recent study of ASL extracts, Nguyen et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-biomolecules-11-00614" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] reported flavonoid and total phenolic contents of 82.61 ± 0.82 mg of quercetin equivalent (QE)/g and 242.88 ± 6.13 mg of gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g, respectively. These studies suggested that ASLs may serve as potential food supplements to improve human health.
