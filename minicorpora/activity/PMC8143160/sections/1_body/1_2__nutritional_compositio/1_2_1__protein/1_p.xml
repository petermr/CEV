 <italic>Annona squamosa</italic> is a lowland tropical shrub that possesses a high pharmaceutical potential for treating cardiac ailments, thyroid-related disorders, diabetes, and cancer. Phytochemical analysis of ASL extracts revealed the presence of numerous phytochemicals, such as proteins, carbohydrates, saponins, alkaloids, flavonoids, phenolics, and glycosides [

ASLs from Menofia showed a protein content of 13.47 mg/g on a fresh weight (FW) basis, whereas ASLs from Mansoura demonstrated the highest protein content of 17.26 mg/g FW. ASLs from Alexandria (3.52 mg/g FW) and Giza (6.80 mg/g FW) showed the lowest protein content. Thus, a higher protein content in ASL extracts can harness the nutritional value of the food for use by humans as well as animals [

 <xref rid="B23-biomolecules-11-00614" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The biuret test confirmed the presence of proteins and amino acids in aqueous ASL extracts, while Millonâ€™s test confirmed the presence of proteins and amino acids in methanolic ASL extracts [
 <xref rid="B24-biomolecules-11-00614" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Limited research has been conducted to date regarding the quantification of amino acids and protein in ASLs; hence, more attention is needed to explore its protein and amino acid profiles.
