<p>ASLs possess appreciable concentrations of various minerals, such as phosphorus (P), potassium (K), iron (Fe), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), copper (Cu), selenium (Se), and zinc (Zn), and vitamins, namely, A, C (ascorbic acid), E, B1 (thiamine), B2 (riboflavin), B3 (niacin), and B9 (folic acid). These minerals are required to maintain a healthy human body, as they help to perform various activities, such as maintenance of healthy teeth and bones, muscle contraction and relaxation, blood clotting, blood pressure regulation, nerve functioning, immune system health, energy metabolism, and many enzymes [
