<p>The bioactive compounds of by-products can be extracted with Soxhlet extraction, hydro-distillation, maceration, cold-pressing and supercritical fluid extraction (SFE). SFE utilizes solvents (such as carbon dioxide) in its supercritical state, in which the solvent acts simultaneously as a liquid and as a gas, resulting in a more efficient extraction process [
