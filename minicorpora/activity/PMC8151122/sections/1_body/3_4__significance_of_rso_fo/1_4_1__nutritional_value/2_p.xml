Meanwhile the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a 2.5–9% of omega-6 intake and 0.5–2% of omega-3 fatty acid intake of daily energy. These differences between ESCF and WHO recommendations occurs due to different nutritional goals, where ESCF recommendation is based on the amounts necessary to correct a clinically overt deficiency, WHO recommendation is based on considerations of cardiovascular health and neurodevelopment [
