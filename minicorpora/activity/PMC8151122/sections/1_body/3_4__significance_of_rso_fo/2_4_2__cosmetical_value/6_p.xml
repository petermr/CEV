<p>Oomah et al. [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-10-00944" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] reports that RSO can be used as a broad-spectrum UV protectant and provide protection against both UV-A and UV-B. However, not many other SPF tests on raspberry seed oil have been made, but the interest in RSO has accelerated [

 <xref rid="B49-plants-10-00944" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] in 2021 has revealed that the oil may not be as effective as concluded in Oomah et al. [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-10-00944" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] research. In the latest study SPF values of the RSO in vitro was 0.4, in vivo 2.6, and it is significantly lower than the values reported in the controversial studies. Ácsová et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-plants-10-00944" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] showed that the overestimated SPF values of RSO was determined by authors who did not strictly followed Mansur’s original methodology.
