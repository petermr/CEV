<p>100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of RAW264.7 cell suspensions was added to each well at a density of 2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per well and incubated for 24 h. After discarding the medium, twofold serially diluted essential oil solutions (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) were added and incubated for 2 h. Subsequently, lipopolysaccharide solutions (LPS, 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) were added to each well at a final concentration of 1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL and incubated for 24 h. Morphological changes were recorded using a Leica DMi8 inverted microscope (Leica Microsystems, Germany). Then, the supernatants were collected and centrifuged. The accumulation of NO in the culture supernatant was determined by a colorimetric NO detection kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China). Dexamethasone (DXM, 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) was used as a positive reference. The secretion of IL-6 and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> was assayed by ELISA kits in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (MultiSciences Biotech Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China).
