<p>The cytotoxicity was evaluated on murine fibroblast cells (L929) and murine macrophages (RAW264.7) by the MTT assay with slight modification [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The L929 and RAW264.7 cells were separately maintained in RPMI 1640 medium and DMEM medium (10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL streptomycin, and 100 U/mL penicillin) and incubated in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere. 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of cell suspensions was added to each well at a density of 2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per well. After 24 h incubation, twofold serially diluted essential oil solutions (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) were added to each well and incubated for 24 h. Subsequently, 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of MTT solution (5 mg/mL in PBS) was added and incubated for 4 h. After discarding the supernate, DMSO (150 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) was added to each well to dissolve the formazan crystal. The absorbance was recorded at 490 nm using a Varioskan Lux Multimode microplate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).
