<p>The essential oils were analyzed by an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with an HP-5MS capillary column (60 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>m film thickness) and a flame ionization detector (FID) (Agilent Technologies Inc., CA, USA). The split ratio was 1 : 20 (injection volume: 1 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) with helium as carrier gas (1 mL/min). The GC oven temperature was as follows: held at 70°C (2 min), 2°C/min to 180°C (55 min), 10°C/min to 310°C (13 min), and kept at 310°C (4 min). The GC-MS analysis was carried out using an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with an Agilent 5975C mass selective detector. The Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph (GC) coupled to an Agilent 5975C mass selective detector (MS) was used to identify the chemical composition of the essential oils. The parameters of GC and capillary column were the same as in GC-FID. The MS was operated in the electron ionization mode at 70 eV and the mass range (
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 29 to 500). The ion source temperature and interface temperature were 230°C and 280°C, respectively. The relative percentage of chemical constituents was determined by the peak area normalization method. A series of n-alkanes (C
 <sub>8</sub>–C
 <sub>30</sub>) were injected to calculate the retention index. The components of the essential oils were identified by comparison of their mass spectrum and calculated retention index and with those listed in Wiley 275 and NIST 17 databases.
