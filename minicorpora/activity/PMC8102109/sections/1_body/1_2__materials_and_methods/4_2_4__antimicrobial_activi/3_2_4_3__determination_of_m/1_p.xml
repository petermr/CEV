<p>The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) values were assayed by our previously published microplate dilution method [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Briefly, 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of bacterial suspension and twofold serially diluted sample solution (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) were added to each well at a final density of 10
 <sup>5</sup> CFU/mL and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Subsequently, resazurin solutions (20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L, 0.1 mg/mL) were added to each well. After 2 h incubation at 37°C in the dark, the MIC values were determined as the minimum sample concentration without color change. For the determination of the MBC values, 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of samples from the wells without color change was subcultured on Mueller-Hinton agar medium. After 24 h incubation at 37°C, the MBC values were determined as the minimum sample concentration without bacterial growth.
