<p>The inhibitory effects of F-EO, L-EO, and S-EO on the proinflammatory mediator (NO) and cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>) were investigated in the lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. According to the MTT assay, all essential oils revealed no significant cytotoxic effect on RAW264.7 and L929 cells at a dose of 16-128 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL in comparison with the untreated control cells (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Hence, the dose of 16-128 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL was used in subsequent experiments. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(a)</xref>, LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophages became irregular in shape and increased in size compared to those in the control group. Compared with the LPS-induced group, RAW264.7 cells in the F-EO, L-EO, and S-EO at doses of 128 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL treated group exhibited relatively smooth surfaces. The accumulation of NO in the culture supernatant was detected by a colorimetric NO detection kit using dexamethasone (DXM, 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) as a positive reference. All essential oils dose-dependently inhibited NO accumulation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(b)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). In particular, compared with the LPS group (19.31 ± 0.56 
 <italic>μ</italic>M), the F-EO, L-EO, and S-EO (128 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) significantly decreased NO production by 2.93 ± 0.38, 2.84 ± 0.15, and 2.46 ± 0.28 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, respectively. The inhibitory ratios of F-EO (93.15 ± 1.36%), L-EO (93.90 ± 1.34%), and S-EO (94.72 ± 1.34%) at doses of 128 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL were comparable to DXM (91.44 ± 1.70%, 3.23 ± 0.42 
 <italic>μ</italic>M). The secretion of IL-6 and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> was assayed by ELISA kits. All essential oils potently suppressed the secretion of IL-6 in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophages, and the inhibitory ratios of S-EO at 64 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL (52.82 ± 0.26%) and 128 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL (77.81 ± 0.20%) and L-EO at 128 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL (56.98 ± 2.06%) were exceeded that of DXM (25.69 ± 4.39% at 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(c)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Besides, compared with the LPS group (3024.36 ± 85.32 pg/mL), the secretion of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> was significantly decreased by F-EO (2504.25 ± 39.23 pg/mL), L-EO (2485.88 ± 29.91 pg/mL), and S-EO (2308.23 ± 69.09 pg/mL) at doses of 128 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(d)</xref>). As shown in 
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, the inhibitory ratio of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> of S-EO (24.93 ± 2.23%) was equivalent to that of DXM (27.07 ± 0.42%). The proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>) and mediator (NO) play key roles in inflammation disorders, and reducing their release is a promising strategy to treat inflammation-related diseases [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In our previous study, 
 <italic>R. beesianus</italic> rhizome essential oil (128 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) significantly inhibited the production of NO (92.73 ± 1.50%), IL-6 (61.08 ± 0.13%), and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> (20.29 ± 0.17%) in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Compared with the essential oils of 
 <italic>R. beesianus</italic> flower, leaf, and rhizome, the essential oil of stem showed the strongest anti-inflammatory activity. The main components in the essential oils, such as 1,8-cineole, methyleugenol, borneol, 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene, linalool, limonene, 
 <italic>β</italic>-myrcene, and bornyl acetate, have been demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory activity [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Hence, the anti-inflammatory activity of F-EO, L-EO, and S-EO may be due to these predominant constituents. These results suggest that 
 <italic>R. beesianus</italic> F-EO, L-EO, and S-EO can provide natural anti-inflammatory agents for the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries.
