<p>The antibacterial properties of essential oils were qualitatively determined by the inhibition zone diameters (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) and quantitatively evaluated by the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) values (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Streptomycin was used as a positive reference. The 
 <italic>R. beesianus</italic> F-EO, L-EO, and S-EO showed broad-spectrum antibacterial effect with DIZ values between 7.28 and 9.69 mm against 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (MIC: 12.50 mg/mL, MBC: 12.50 mg/mL), 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> (MIC: 3.13–6.25 mg/mL, MBC: 6.25 mg/mL), 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MIC: 6.25–12.50 mg/mL, MBC: 12.50 mg/mL), 
 <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic> (MIC: 3.13 mg/mL, MBC: 12.50 mg/mL), 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (MIC: 6.25 mg/mL, MBC: 12.50 mg/mL), and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (MIC: 3.13–6.25 mg/mL, MBC: 6.25–12.50 mg/mL). In previous studies, the antibacterial activity of predominance components, such as borneol, 1,8-cineole, methyleugenol, 
 <italic>β</italic>-myrcene, limonene, camphene, and 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene, has been demonstrated [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Hence, these major constituents could explain the significant antibacterial properties of 
 <italic>R. beesianus</italic> F-EO, L-EO, and S-EO. These results suggest that 
 <italic>R. beesianus</italic> F-EO, L-EO, and S-EO can be used as a natural source of antibacterial agents for the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries.
