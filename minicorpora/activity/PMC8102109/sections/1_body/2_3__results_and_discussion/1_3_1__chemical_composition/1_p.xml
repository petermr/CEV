<p>The hydrodistillation of fresh flower, leaf, and stem of 
 <italic>R. beesianus</italic> separately yielded essential oils at 0.21% (

 <italic>w</italic>) on a fresh weight basis. The GC-FID/MS analysis showed the identification of forty-six, forty-four, and sixty-three compounds accounting for 98.6%, 98.7%, and 96.0% of the total oil content of flower, leaf, and stem, respectively (

 <italic>R. beesianus</italic> F-EO was mainly composed of bornyl formate (21.7%), 1,8-cineole (21.6%), borneol (9.7%), methyleugenol (7.7%), 
 <italic>β</italic>-myrcene (5.4%), limonene (4.7%), camphene (4.5%), linalool (3.4%), and 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (3.1%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The predominant components of L-EO were bornyl formate (33.9%), borneol (13.2%), 1,8-cineole (12.1%), methyleugenol (8.0%), camphene (7.8%), bornyl acetate (6.2%), and 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (4.3%) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In our previous study, the yield of 
 <italic>R. beesianus</italic> rhizome oil was 0.22% (
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>), and its predominance components were 1,8-cineole (47.6%), borneol (15.0%), methyleugenol (11.2%), and bornyl formate (7.6%) [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. 
 <italic>R. beesianus</italic> stem had the highest essential oil yield, as compared with the flower, leaf, and rhizome. Hence, the observed difference in the yield and composition of the essential oils could be attributed to the part of the plant used.
