<p>To our knowledge, this is the first report on the chemical constituents and bioactivities of essential oils from 
 <italic>R. beesianus</italic> flower, leaf, and stem. Forty-six, forty-four, and sixty-three compounds were identified in the F-EO, L-EO, and S-EO by using GC-FID/MS, respectively. The F-EO, L-EO, and S-EO exhibited significant antibacterial property against 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Besides, the F-EO, L-EO, and S-EO significantly inhibited the production of proinflammatory mediator NO and cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-
 <italic>Î±</italic>) in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells in the absence of cytotoxicity. In particular, the essential oil of the stem showed the highest yield and anti-inflammatory activity. Hence, the essential oils of 
 <italic>R. beesianus</italic> flower, leaf, and stem could be regarded as antibacterial and anti-inflammatory natural products with a high application potential in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic fields.
