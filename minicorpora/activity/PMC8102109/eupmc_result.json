    "<i>Rhynchanthus beesianus</i> is a medicinal, ornamental, and edible plant, and its essential oil has been used as an aromatic stomachic in China. In this study, the chemical constituents, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties of flower essential oil (F-EO), leaf essential oil (L-EO), and stem essential oil (S-EO) of <i>R. beesianus</i> were investigated for the first time. According to the GC-FID/MS assay, the F-EO was mainly composed of bornyl formate (21.7%), 1,8-cineole (21.6%), borneol (9.7%), methyleugenol (7.7%), <i>Î²</i>-myrcene (5.4%), limonene (4.7%), camphene (4.5%), linalool (3.4%), and <i>Î±</i>-pinene (3.1%). The predominant components of L-EO were bornyl formate (33.9%), borneol (13.2%), 1,8-cineole (12.1%), methyleugenol (8.0%), camphene (7.8%), bornyl acetate (6.2%), and <i>Î±</i>-pinene (4.3%). The main components of S-EO were borneol (22.5%), 1,8-cineole (21.3%), methyleugenol (14.6%), bornyl formate (11.6%), and bornyl acetate (3.9%). For the bioactivities, the F-EO, L-EO, and S-EO exhibited significant antibacterial property against <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Proteus vulgaris</i>, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, and <i>Escherichia coli</i> with the inhibition zones (7.28-9.69âmm), MIC (3.13-12.50âmg/mL), and MBC (6.25-12.50âmg/mL). Besides, the F-EO, L-EO, and S-EO significantly inhibited the production of proinflammatory mediator nitric oxide (NO) (93.15-94.72%) and cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) (23.99-77.81%) and tumor necrosis factor-<i>Î±</i> (TNF-<i>Î±</i>) (17.69-24.93%) in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells at the dose of 128â<i>Î¼</i>g/mL in the absence of cytotoxicity. Hence, the essential oils of <i>R. beesianus</i> flower, leaf, and stem could be used as natural antibacterial and anti-inflammatory agents with a high application potential in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic fields."
