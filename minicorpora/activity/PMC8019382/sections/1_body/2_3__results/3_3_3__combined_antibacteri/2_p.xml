<p>The combination of 
 <italic>C. pustulatus</italic> and 
 <italic>R. abyssinicus</italic> essential oils had 29 mm IZ in diameter against both MSSA and MRSA. It showed an effective antibacterial effect on 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli.</italic> It had MIC values ranging from 2.0–8.0 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/ml for tested Gram-negative bacteria and 2.0 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/ml against MRSA. It had MBC value 4.0 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/ml for 
 <italic>K. pneumonia</italic> and MRSA and 16 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/ml against ESBL producing 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Similarly, the combined effect of EOs obtained from 
 <italic>R. abyssinicus</italic> and 
 <italic>D. penninervium</italic> had 29 mm and 22 mm IZ in diameter at 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/disc against 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli,</italic> respectively (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). It had also 32 mm IZ in diameter on MSSA and MRSA. Interestingly, combined effect of three EOs within 1 : 1:1 had 34 mm, 37 mm, and 26 mm on MRSA, VRE, and ESBL producing 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa,</italic> respectively. This combination had MIC and MBC ranging from 0.25–4.0 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/ml for tested bacteria. Overall, the combination of each EO had more potent antibacterial effect on MRSA and 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa,</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> as compared to currently available and affordable antibiotics (
