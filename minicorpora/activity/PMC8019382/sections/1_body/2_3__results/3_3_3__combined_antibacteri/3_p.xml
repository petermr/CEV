<p>The fractional inhibitory concentration index (FIC index) revealed that the combined essential oils from 
 <italic>R. abyssinicus</italic> and 
 <italic>D. penninervium</italic> in 1 : 1 ratio had synergistic effect on MRSA, VRE, and 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae.</italic> It had also adaptive effect on ESBL producing 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa.</italic> On the other hand, mixture of 
 <italic>R. abyssinicus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. pustulatus</italic> had synergistic effect on VRE and additive on MRSA and 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>. Conversely, it had antagonistic effect on ESBL producing 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. The mixture of essential oils from 
 <italic>C. pustulatus</italic> and 
 <italic>D. penninervium</italic> showed additive effect on MRSA and 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae.</italic> Its FIC index values were 075 and 0.625 for MRSA and 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae,</italic> respectively. Overall, MRSA was most susceptible for combined essential oil. In contrary to this, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> resisted bacteria as compared to other bacteria for combined oil (
