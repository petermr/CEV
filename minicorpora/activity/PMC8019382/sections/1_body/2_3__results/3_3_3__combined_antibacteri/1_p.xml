<p>This study revealed that combination of essential oils 1 : 1 ratio was more strong antibacterial effect than individual essential oil alone and even equivalent to modern drug of choice. The combined EOs inhibited the growth of MRSA and ESBL producing 
 <italic>E coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and their reference strains at 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/disc (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), of which the combined EO obtained from 
 <italic>R. abyssinicus</italic> and 
 <italic>D. penninervium</italic> (1 : 1 ratio) exhibited the strongest antibacterial activities. It had IZ in diameters 32 mm, 34 mm, and 19 mm on MRSA, VRE, and ESBL producing 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> at 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/disc, respectively. This mixture had the lowest MIC and MBC values as compared to the other mixture. The MIC value for VRE was 1.0 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/ml and MRSA (2.0 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/ml). The MBC values were ranging from 1.0–8.0 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/ml for ESBL producing 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). This combined oil showed powerful bactericidal effect as compared to modern antibiotics against tested reference and drug-resistant bacteria species.
