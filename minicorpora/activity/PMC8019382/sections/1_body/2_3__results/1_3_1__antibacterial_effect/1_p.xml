<p>Majority of bacteria isolated from wounds were resistant to two or more antibiotics. In this regard, methicillin resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA) and ESBL producing 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> were major wound colonizing bacteria. From Gram-positive bacteria, MRSA and VRE were resisted for amikacin, cefoxitin, amoxicine, ampicillin, and cefotaxime (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). On the other hand, Gram-negative bacteria ESBL producing 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> were isolated from surgical wounds. Those Gram-negative bacteria have been undermining in the case of wound care, whereas these bacteria strains were unpredictably resisted for classical modern third-generation cephalosporins and penicillin classes (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In such cases, gene or gene products of those bacteria transfer intra- or interbacteria species compromised treatment options and worsen the future of medical care.
