<p>The essential oil of

 <italic>R. abyssinicus, C. pustulatus,</italic> and 
 <italic>D. penninervium</italic> showed IZ 20 mm, 19 mm, and 22 mm, respectively, on ESBL producing 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> that were second common bacteria isolates from wounds. Those EOs had MIC and MBC values ranging from 4–32
