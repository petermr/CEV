<p>This study revealed that testing essential oils had broad bactericidal activities. They inhibited growth of 
 <italic>E. faecalis, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae,</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> with zones of IZ ranging from 12–26 mm (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Thus, oils demonstrated an antibacterial effect against wound colonization MRSA and ESBL producing Gram-negative bacteria. Their effectiveness varied with the concentration and type of bacterial species. For instance, 
 <italic>R. abyssinicus</italic> inhibited the growth of MRSA (23 mm) and ESBL producing 
 <italic>E coli</italic> (22 mm) and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (20 mm) at its 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/disc, whereas 
 <italic>D. penninervium</italic> inhibited the growth of MRSA (21 mm) and ESBL producing 
 <italic>E coli</italic> (18 mm) and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (22 mm) at its 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/disc. These essential oils had an inhibitory effect on both reference strains and MDR bacteria with IZ ranging from 9–26 mm in diameter and MIC and MBC values ranging from 2–32 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/ml. The EOs of 
 <italic>R. abyssinicus, C. pustulatus,</italic> and 
 <italic>D. penninervium</italic> showed IZ in diameter values 23 mm, 19 mm, and 21 mm on the MRSA, respectively. Vancomycin resistant 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> were highly susceptible for tested EOs as compared to other species.
