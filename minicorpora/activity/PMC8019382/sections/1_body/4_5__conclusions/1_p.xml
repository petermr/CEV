<p>This study revealed that testing combined effect of essential oils had broad bactericidal activities, of which they demonstrated more strong antibacterial effect against common wound colonization of MRSA and ESBL producing 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa.</italic> Moreover, majority of combined oil had synergistic and additive effect which provided information to search a novel compound in combination of essential oils or alone. Hence, identifying and structural elucidation of compounds with immunomodulatory and bactericidal effect from essential oils help pharmaceutical companies and researchers to develop less toxic, safe, and affordable drugs or modulators or precursors for the synthesis of new antimicrobial drugs and/or ointment to treat wounds.
