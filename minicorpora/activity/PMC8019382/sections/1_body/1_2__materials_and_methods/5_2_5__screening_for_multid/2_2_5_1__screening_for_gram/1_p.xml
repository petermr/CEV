<p>Selected multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria such as ESBL producing 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> were detected by double disk synergy test (DDST) as described by Jarlier [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Mueller Hinton Agar was inoculated with standardized inoculum using sterile cotton swab. Augmentin (20 
 <italic>μ</italic>g amoxicillin and 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g of clavulanic acid, AMC) disk was placed in the center of the plate and test disks of cephalosporins (ceftazidime 30 
 <italic>μ</italic>g, ceftriaxone 30 
 <italic>μ</italic>g, and cefotaxime 30 
 <italic>μ</italic>g) and aztreonam 30 
 <italic>μ</italic>g disks were placed at 20 mm distance (center to center) from the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid disk before incubation. The plate was incubated overnight at 35°C. Enhancement of the zone of inhibition of any one of the four drug disks toward amoxicillin-clavulanic acid suggested the presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> was screened for its resistance to more than two different classes of antibiotics following disk diffusion method as CLSI guidelines [
