<p>Multidrug-resistant bacteria were isolated from wounds. All bacterial cultures were first grown on 5% BA plates at 37°C for 18–24 hrs before inoculation onto the MHA. Few colonies (3–5) of similar morphology of the respective bacteria were transferred with a sterile inoculating loop to a liquid medium until adequate growth of turbidity with McFarland in 0.5. Then, the bacterial suspension was streaked on MHA plates using a sterile swab in such a way as to ensure thorough coverage of the plates and a uniform thick lawn of growth following incubation. The susceptibilities of clinical isolates were tested by using the MHA containing a range of antimicrobial agents. Dilutions of overnight broth cultures were inoculated onto antibiotic-containing plates to yield final inoculums of approximately 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU per spot for
