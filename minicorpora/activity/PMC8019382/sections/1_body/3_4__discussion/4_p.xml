<p>This study revealed that combined effect of essential oils was more effective and efficient antibacterial effect than used alone and even equal to modern drug of choice. These synergistic combinations signify to exploited novel compounds from essential oils. This is also the enhanced bactericidal effect of the compounds. In such case, essential oils are suitable candidates to develop topical ointments for wound care and beyond [

Overall, essential oils have compounds that used to produce affordable and safe antibiotics and potentially activate the immune system for fast wound healing. The EOs have therapeutic compounds that exert beneficial pharmacological potential on wound care to overcome the problem from multidrug-resistant bacteria.
