<p>These study findings showed that almost all tested essential oils had promising antibacterial activity on the multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacteria colonizing and triggering wound infection, of which MRSA was more susceptible to tested essential oils in combination and/or alone. Likewise, VRE was also inhibited by most tested essential oils at 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/disc. These findings substantiate earlier studies that the therapeutic agents derived from essential oils can devastate the cell wall of bacteria and later kill them. Many compounds such as leptospermone, tricyclene, flavesone, myrcene, carvacrol, p-cymene, and eugenol are able to activate humoral and cellular immunity [
