<p>This study revealed that MRSA, VRE, and ESBL producing 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> were human pathogen MDR bacteria isolated from wound samples. Those strains were compromised for all or the majority of antibiotics used in low- and middle-income countries (

In this way, infected wounds with multidrug-resistant bacteria have limited treatment options and escalating mortality, morbidity rates, and treatment costs [

As a result, they imposed a potentially large health and socioeconomic burden on societies and worries about the future provision of medical-surgical and other healthcare services [
