<p>Modern humans have universally used medicinal plants for healing properly many ailments [

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Evolving of the powerful analytical tools based upon proteomics, metabolomics, and genomics can aid to discover novel compounds from medicinal plants. The compounds of plant origin have divergent chemical structures and functionally relevant precursor molecules to discover antibiotics [

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Besides this, widely ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological studies of essential oils from plants contributed to finding various compounds, of which leptospermone, tricyclene, flavesone, myrcene, carvacrol, p-cymene, eugenol, 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene, phenylpropanoids, 
 <italic>β</italic>-selinene, and calamenene are some important compounds inhibiting the growth and biofilm formation of pathogen bacteria and used as immunomodulatory compounds [

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. For instance, carvacrol caused collapse of the proton-motive force and depletion of the ATP pool, with consequent cell death [
