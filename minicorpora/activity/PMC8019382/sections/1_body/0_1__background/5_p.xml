<p>Currently, using combined conventional antibiotics and essential oils or essential oils themselves as wound care ointments are promising strategies to overcome multidrug-resistant bacteria. MRSA and ESBL producing 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> have resisted for amoxicillin, tetracycline, piperacillin, ofloxacin, and oxacillin [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Many studies showed that combined effect of 
 <italic>Leptospermum scoparium</italic> and Tri-EDTA; 
 <italic>Mentha piperita and Micromelum integerrimum</italic> and
 <italic>;</italic> cinnamon bark oil and cinnamaldehyde had synergistic antibacterial activity on MSSA
 <italic>, E. coli,</italic> MRSA, ESBL, and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> [

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. From these viewpoints, we purposed to evaluate combined antibacterial activity of EOs extracted from 
 <italic>R. abyssinicus, C. pustulatus,</italic> and 
 <italic>D. penninervium</italic> against bacteria isolated from wounds. Essential oils had immunomodulatory compounds that serve as a baseline data to formulate and designing novel compounds and find out the scientific rationale for the combined effects of untapped medicinal plants used by different societies.
