<p>The biochemical composition of 
 <italic>M. charantia</italic>, 
 <italic>M. foetida</italic> and 
 <italic>M. balsamina</italic> gives them a great and interesting nutritional and medicinal value. Many of its components have singular biological activity and the synergy of them may exert interesting pharmacological properties. Several studies demonstrated that these important plants have the potential to be utilized for medicinal purposes as they exhibit anti-diabetic, anti-microbial, anthelmintic, abortifacient, anti-bacterial, anti-viral, and chemo-preventive activities. These species possess a promising and innovative source of natural bioactive agents such as resins, alkaloids, flavonoids, glycosides, steroids, terpenes, cardiac glycoside, saponins, pectin, carbohydrates, amino acids, proteins, fats, fiber, chlorophyll, phosphorus, calcium, potassium, magnesium, sodium, zinc, manganese, and iron. The main biological activities of Momordica spp. has been summarized in
