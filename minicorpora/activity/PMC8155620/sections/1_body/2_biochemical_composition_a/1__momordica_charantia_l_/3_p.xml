<p>Main phenolic acids found in 
 <italic>M. charantia</italic> are gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, catechin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, and ferulic acid (

 <italic>β</italic>-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, 
 <italic>α</italic>-carotene, and 
 <italic>β</italic>-carotene have also detected from the fruit of 
 <italic>M. charantia</italic> (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). The variation in phenolic acids and carotenoids contents at different maturity stages create a strong relationship with the anti-oxidant activities of 
 <italic>M. charantia</italic> fruit. The crop consists of non-essential amino acids such as arginine, alanine, aspartic acid, glycine, glutamic acid, proline, histidine and serine. Such non-essential amino acids are inherently higher in concentration, as compared to essential amino acids such as leucine, cysteine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, methionine, lysine, threonine, tyrosine and valine. From the leaves of 
 <italic>M. charantia</italic> leucine and aromatic (tyrosine and phenylalanine) were the predominant amino acids, while aspartic acid and glutamic acid are major non-essential amino acids of this plant (
