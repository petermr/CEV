 <italic>Momordica charantia</italic> L. (Bitter melon), 
 <italic>Momordica foetida</italic> Schumach. (Bitter cucumber), 
 <italic>Momordica balsamina</italic> L. (African pumpkin) are widely cultivated and they belong to the family Cucurbitaceae (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Daniel et al., 2014</xref>). In some African countries; fruits, leafy shoots and the ripe seeds from these three species are harvested for consumption as vegetable, spices and leaves are mixed with water and consumed as beverages (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Cantwell et al., 1996</xref>). 
 <italic>Momordica</italic> species (spp.) are annual crops but can be regarded as perennial crop due to their performance during the season (

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abegunde et al., 2018</xref>). These crop species are mostly adapted to areas of minimum annual average rainfall such as those that receive an average of 400 mm as well as those with mild and frost-free winters (
 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr">Tokhtar and Doan, 2014</xref>). 
 <italic>Momordica</italic> spp. require a minimum temperature of 18°C during emergence and germination and during vegetative stage and flowering and an optimal temperature ranging between 24 and 27°C (
 <xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al., 2008</xref>). Some researchers have stated that the crops adapt and perform well in deep and well-drained sandy loam and slit loam soils which are rich in organic matter and adapt well in soils with optimum soil pH ranging from 4.3 to 8.0 (
 <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">Tan C. et al., 2015</xref>). However, they can adapt to alkaline soils with up to pH of 8.0 (

 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Harinantenaina et al., 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al., 2008</xref>). 
 <italic>Momordica</italic> spp. are open-pollinated and consist of separate male and female flowers on the same plant (
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">Palada and Chang, 2003</xref>). Flowering of 
 <italic>Momordica</italic> species begins a month after planting until reaching dormancy. The fruits are orange in color and soft when ripe with black seeds (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Bakare et al., 2010</xref>). The local South African indigenous traditional people have been using 
 <italic>Momordica</italic> spp. as culinary species or enhance bitterness of the meat and of vegetables (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">Madala et al., 2014</xref>). However, studies on the trend of food consumption for rural residents in developing countries have often focused relatively on the economic factors such as prices, income, and market development 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Jia et al. (2017)</xref>, and have rarely covered social and psychological influences.
