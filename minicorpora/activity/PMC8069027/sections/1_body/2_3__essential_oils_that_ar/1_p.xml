<p>Depending on the source, essential oils are highly volatile, colored, and/or transparent in nature. They are considered natural products with a strong smell and are generally produced by aromatic plants as secondary metabolites [
 <xref rid="B70-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Although they are the secondary metabolites, their susceptible nature can be degraded quickly under the influence of oxygen, light, and moderate temperature fluctuations. These oils represent a significant part of conventional pharmacopeia (i.e., the official publication of medicinal drugs). Generally, the essential oils are extracted from flowers (rosemary, chamomile, and lavender), fruits/berries (black pepper, juniper berry, and May chang), buds (clove), leaves (thyme, eucalyptus, and rosemary), roots (ginger, angelica), seeds (coriander, cardamom, and fennel) and bark (cassia and cinnamon) of aromatic plants. Furthermore, these essential oils are also deposited in glandular trichomes, cavities, and plant secretory cells [

 <xref rid="B71-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The oils present in these aromatic plants are known to exhibit some excellent properties, such as antioxidant [

 <xref rid="B30-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], insecticidal [

 <xref rid="B32-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], analgesic, and anti-inflammatory [
 <xref rid="B37-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and as food preservatives [
 <xref rid="B36-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The researchers observed that the oregano essential oil (OEO), rich in carvacrol and thymol, is an effective antimicrobial agent against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria such as 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa,</italic> and 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia,</italic> as well as against other multiresistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. This oil also exhibits antitumor activities against a variety of cancers, such as hepatic, cervical, colon, and breast cancers, with IC50 values ranging from approximatively 8 to 300 Âµg/mL. In addition, the antibacterial, ant-inflammatory, and antioxidative effects of OEO have been shown to aid certain common skin disorders such as acne, aging, and wound healing [

 <xref rid="B74-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,
 <xref rid="B75-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. The essential oils and their constituents mainly target the cytoplasm and plasma membrane and sometimes change the cell morphology, leading to microbe death. It is worth mentioning that more than 60 individual components are present in essential oils [

 <xref rid="ijms-22-04017-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) can comprise up to 85%, whereas other components are available in trace amounts [

 <xref rid="B78-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. The phenolic compounds of essential oils are mainly responsible for their antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="B79-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. The composition of aromatic oils is enormously altered by gene type (species, cultivar, clone, ecotype), environmental factors (geographical origin, climatic condition, soil composition), and technical factors (cultivation, types of collection, storage of crude material, and processing technique). For these reasons, a plant of the same species but from different conditions can reveal contrasting characteristics and chemical compositions [

 <xref rid="B81-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Therefore, few methods are mainly used to extract essential oils, including steam distillation and hydrodistillation. However, steam distillation is the most preferred method, as it does not require any solvent and is faster than other methods. Additionally, steam distillation preserves the pristine quality of oils. Structures of some of the main constituents of essential oils are shown in
