<p>Researchers have used the coprecipitation method for the preparation of cinnamon essential oil (CEO) and β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) inclusion complex into polylactic acid (PLA) polymer to produce antimicrobial PLA/CEO/β-CD nanofilm by electrospinning [

 <xref rid="B133-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. The researchers indicated that pork covered with PLA/CEO/β-CD nanofibers remained preserved for a long time. Further, the PLA/CEO/β-CD nanofilm was harmless and environmentally friendly, which could benefit other meat-based food products when used as active packaging material.
