<p>Mohammadi et al. investigated the effects of chitosan nanofibers, emulsified cinnamon oil, and cinnamon essential oil-loaded nanolipid carriers on microstructural antibacterial activity and mechanical strength of the resulting bio-nanocomposite films prepared by the casting method [

This study introduces a novel eco-friendly bio-nanocomposite in packaging industries for the shelf-life extension of different perishable foods. The nanofibers developed in this study decreased the water solubility and water-vapor permeability of whey protein isolate film by incorporating chitosan nanofibers and cinnamon oil in both forms (emulsified and nanolipid carriers) [
 <xref rid="B150-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. Whey protein isolate has high water-vapor permeability, which is due to the presence of hydrophilic groups. This can be diminished by introducing functional groups that decrease the hydrophilic sites or incorporation into chitosan nanofibers, which slows down water molecules’ penetration [
 <xref rid="B151-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>]. It was observed that by incorporating chitosan nanofibers in whey protein isolate films, tensile strength and Young’s modulus increased, but after integrating cinnamon oil in both forms (emulsified and nanolipid carriers), tensile strength and Young’s modulus decreased [
 <xref rid="B152-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. The reduced transparency of nanocomposites after incorporating chitosan nanofibers and cinnamon oil resulted in an increase in barrier properties against food spoilers (light, oxygen, heat). The increase in barrier can be favorable for preserving the foods and protecting food against oxidative reactions. The whey protein isolate–chitosan nanofiber composite containing cinnamon oil-loaded nanolipid carriers showed more antibacterial efficiency against

 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> strains than the whey protein isolate–chitosan nanofiber composite containing emulsified cinnamon essential oil.
