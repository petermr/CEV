<p>The antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antifungal properties of tea tree essential oils can be retained by adding them into biodegradable films [

 <xref rid="B170-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>]. It was observed that a small concentration of TTO (0.08%) increased the tensile strength due to the crosslinking effect between matrix and oil, while the elongation rate was reduced. However, the value of TTO above 0.08% experienced the opposite situation, except for the low level of nanofiber cellulose concentration when the elongation percentage was even lower. The films containing TTO had a water-contact angle &gt;65°, and therefore were considered as more hydrophobic than control films with nanofiber cellulose and films without the TTO and nanofiber cellulose. The low water-contact angle of control films with nanofiber cellulose and films without the TTO and nanofiber cellulose was due to the cassava starch amylases’ chemical affinity with water [

 <xref rid="B172-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>]. Actually, the cellulose fibers were less hygroscopic than starch, which led to the weakening of the amylaceous matrix hydrophilicity, and therefore the film solubility [
 <xref rid="B173-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>]. Despite the oils’ lipidic characteristics, the solubility of films with TTO was somewhat more substantial than the solubility of control films (nanofiber cellulose). This could be related to a decrease in the matrix’s molecular interactions in which the disorder may increase component solubility [
 <xref rid="B174-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>]. Terpinene-4-ol components present in TTO with higher antibacterial activity could be responsible for raising the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane’s permeability and promoting microbial cell damage [

 <xref rid="B178-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>]. The results derived from this research suggest using cassava starch–glycerol with nanofiber cellulose film to cut down the application of synthetic polymers and maintain the active properties of TTO. This film has a bright potential for cosmetic, pharmaceutical, and food-packaging operations.
