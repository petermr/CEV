<p>Tea tree essential oil (TTO) is a natural essential oil, a complex blend of different organic compounds derived from 
 <italic>Melaleuca alternifolia</italic>. It exhibits a wide variety of antifungal, antibacterial, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory activity. Its large spectrum of antimicrobial activity is mainly due to its diverse chemical nature, especially its volatile components, e.g., 1,8-cineole, terpinen-4-ol, and terpilenol. 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O157:H7, one of the leading contagious microbes, boost their numbers immediately on contaminated meat products, such as beef, because of higher moisture and rich protein content [

 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O157:H7 can cause serious ailments such as hemorrhagic colitis [

The plasma-treated PEO nanofiber membranes containing TTO/β-CD-IC could extend the shelf-life of beef, thereby suggesting a role as a possible application in active food packaging. The researchers produced nanofibers with a smooth and uniform surface morphology. The results indicated a positive relation between release efficiency and antibacterial activity. After giving plasma treatment to PEO nanofibers, the release efficiency of TTO exceeded, and the antibacterial activity of PEO nanofibers also was enhanced accordingly. For this reason, plasma-treated TTO/β-CD-IC PEO nanofibers showed a higher bactericidal effect than TTO/β-CD-IC PEO against

Plasma-treated TTO/PEO/β-CD-IC nanofibers at 4 °C, 12 °C, and 25 °C after storing for 7 days showed improvement in color, flavor, appearance, and overall acceptability of beef samples compared with the control and plasma-treated nanofibers at 35 °C [
