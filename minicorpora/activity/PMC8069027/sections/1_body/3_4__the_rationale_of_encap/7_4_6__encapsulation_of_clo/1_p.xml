<p>Clove oil (CLO) is isolated from 
 <italic>Eugenia caryophyllata,</italic> an aromatic flower bud made up of caryophyllene, eugenol, and other compounds such as benzyl alcohol. Owing to its therapeutic properties such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial activities, its key components have been commonly used for decades. Even though it possesses extensive antimicrobial and antioxidant activities, CLO is unable to inhibit the growth of bacteria in the long term due to its volatility and instability [

 <xref rid="B200-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">200</xref>]. CLO’s antibacterial activity is due to its three main compounds: eugenol, eugenyl acetate, and β-caryophyllene. Cui et al. developed CLO-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (CNPs) to enhance their stability and long-term antibacterial activity [
 <xref rid="B201-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">201</xref>]. The morphology of electrospun CLO@CNP-loaded gelatin (GEL) nanofibers was thin and smooth. These nanofibers were stable and had a uniform diameter [

 <xref rid="B203-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">203</xref>]. Increasing the concentration of CLO@CNPs, GEL, and treatment time improved the in vitro antibiofilm effect of 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O157:H7 and reduced the population of biofilm formation up to 99.99%. The population of 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O157:H7 biofilm on cucumber also decreased when tested at 4 °C and 12 °C for four days. However, at 25 °C and 37 °C, the antibiofilm effects of GEL/CLO@CNPs nanofibers were not satisfying because of the faster growth of 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O157:H7 at a higher temperature. The sensory evaluation results indicated that the GEL/CLO@CNPs nanofiber treatment could maintain the color and flavor of cucumber well for more than four days, compared with the control groups. The overall results indicated that the GEL/CLO@CNPs nanofibers had good stability and antibiofilm activity and could have food-packaging applications.
