<p>Another study was conducted by Unalan et al. to design electrospun antibacterial poly(Îµ-caprolactone)-gelatin/clove essential oil (PCL-GEL/CLO) nanofiber mats for wound healing [
 <xref rid="B204-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">204</xref>]. The nanofibrous mats could cover the wound area, and could maintain a proper moist environment and antibacterial properties to prevent wound contamination [

 <xref rid="B208-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">208</xref>]. Glacial acetic acid was used as a solvent, as it is nontoxic [

 <xref rid="B210-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">210</xref>]. Smooth, uniform, bead-free, and thin (41 to 300 nm) PCL nanofiber mats encapsulating GEL and CLO were obtained. The inclusion of CLO decreased the water-contact angle, making the PCL-GEL/CLO6% nanofiber mat more hydrophilic, which is desirable for wound-healing applications [
 <xref rid="B211-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">211</xref>]. In vitro biocompatibility tests showed that CLO-loaded PCL-GEL nanofiber mats were harmless to normal human dermal fibroblasts. On the other hand, after adding CLO to PCL-GEL/fibers, they showed antibacterial activity against

 <xref rid="B212-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">212</xref>]. Thus, these CLO-loaded PCL-GEL nanofiber mats may have implications in wound-healing operations and can be treated as a promising biomaterial to restrict bacterial infections without using antibiotics.
