<p>Similarly, a great threat to human health and a significant loss in the economy comes from

 <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic> on the meat surface. In this regard, Lin et al. prepared antibacterial nanofibers while encapsulating TEO/β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) ε-poly-L-lysine (ε-PLY) (TCPNs) nanoparticles into a gelatin (GEL) polymer using the electrospinning method [

From the sensory analysis, it was seen that there was no significant difference between treatment TCPNs containing GEL nanofibers (TEGNs) and the pure GEL nanofiber. Hence, the TCPNs-loaded GEL nanofibers had a considerable possibility for meat storage without affecting sensory evaluation.
