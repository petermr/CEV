<p>Certain readily available sustainable biopolymers, e.g., starch, have incorporated antimicrobial agents to provide microbiological stability to foods [

 <xref rid="B220-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">220</xref>]. Still, they have not been widely used in the packaging industry to replace conventional petroleum plastic, mainly because of their low mechanical, barrier, and technological properties [

 <xref rid="B223-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">223</xref>]. Therefore, nanocomposites that exhibit better mechanical, thermal, optical, and barrier properties than pure polymers were incorporated into biopolymer films to overcome these limitations [

 <xref rid="B227-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">227</xref>]. As the concentration of essential oil increased, brightness decreased for both bentonite and halloysite, making them cloudy, which resulted in smoother surfaces that influenced light diffraction [

 <xref rid="B229-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">229</xref>]. Starch polymer thickness enlarged with the incorporation of OEO and nanocomposites [
 <xref rid="B230-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">230</xref>]. The oxygen and carbon dioxide permeability were elevated by bentonite/OEO fibers, and for halloysite films, carbon dioxide permeability declined as the OEO amount increased. Composite starch/bentonite or starch/halloysite fibers present a fibrous like design, reduce pore density, and expand pore size after adding OEO. Generally, Mexican OEO containing edible starch fibers had an excellent fungicidal effect. Mexican OEO was remarkably effective against

 <italic>Rhizopus</italic> species. Halloysite films were more effective than bentonite at a 1% concentration of OEO [
