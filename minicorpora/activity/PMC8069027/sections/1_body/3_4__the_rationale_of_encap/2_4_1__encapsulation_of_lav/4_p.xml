<p>In another study, Balasubramanian et al. fabricated NaCl-assisted polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofiber loaded with LO by the electrospinning technique [
 <xref rid="B103-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Different concentrations of an electrolyte solution of NaCl (0%, 0.1%, and 0.3% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>) were added to the polymeric solution to enhance the electrospinning capability. It was observed that with the addition of 0.3% electrolyte solution, the bead formation stopped, the degree of polydispersity decreased, and the superior nanofibers were formed with an average diameter of 88.55 nm [

 <xref rid="B105-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Thermal gravimetric analysis indicated that as the LO was encapsulated into the PAN nanofiber, the thermal stability increased [

 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic> for more than 30 days. Maximum loading capacity and encapsulation efficiency were achieved when 0.3 wt % LO was encapsulated into PAN. When the LO increased, the loading capacity and encapsulation efficiency also increased in the matrix [

 <sup>−1</sup>, the cell viability was reduced. The LO/PAN nanofibers avoided cell damage even at a larger amount of 200 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. Thus, PAN nanofibers can be used as a promising antibacterial material in various fields, such as biomedical, textile, and water-treatment applications.
