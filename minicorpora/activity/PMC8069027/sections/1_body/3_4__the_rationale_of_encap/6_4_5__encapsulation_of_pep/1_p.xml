<p>Peppermint essential oil (PO) is primarily obtained from the leaves of 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic>, a medicinal plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family. It is commonly distributed in the world’s temperate zones, primarily throughout Europe, North America, and North Africa. Menthol, menthone, menthofuran, and menthyl acetate are the main components of this oil. Other bioactive compounds in PO include polyphenols, flavonoids, tocopherols, caffeic acid, choline, carotene, and tannins. It has been used to treat tumors, sore throat, indigestion, fatigue, colds, and cramps, owing to its different bioactive ingredients. It also possesses certain biomedical properties such as antibacterial, antiviral, and antioxidant. Unalan et al. fabricated poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) electrospun mats loaded with different concentrations of PO (1.5, 3, and 6%

This study showed that the morphology of the electrospun fiber mats was smooth, uniform, and bead-free following the PO’s integration into the PCL solution. Raman spectroscopy and GC–MS analysis confirmed the presence of 1, 8-cineole, menthol, and menthone, the main components of PO [

 <xref rid="B181-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>], after observing the peaks of these different components in the fiber [

 <xref rid="B185-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>]. The PCL electrospun fiber mats’ water-contact angle was 104 ± 8°, although the PO inclusion marginally declined the contact angle of water to 98 ± 5°. This small reduction of the water-contact angle with the addition of PO might be due to the combination of H
 <sub>2</sub>O molecules with the oxygenated group present in this oil’s chemical structure [
 <xref rid="B186-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>]. The encapsulation efficiency of PO into PCL and its antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> improved as the concentration of this oil increased [

 <xref rid="B187-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>]. It was also observed that the PCL nanofiber was harmless to human dermal fibroblasts. However, there was no significant difference between PCL fibers consisting of different PO concentrations. Therefore, PO-incorporated PCL nanofibers prepared by electrospinning are considered promising candidates for wound-healing applications.
