<p>Jaganathan et al. developed electrospun polyurethane (PU) nanofibers loaded with PO and copper sulfate (CuSO
 <sub>4</sub>) for wound dressing [
 <xref rid="B188-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>]. PU was used because of its excellent mechanical and ultraviolet stability, biocompatible and biodegradable behavior, and oxidative and thermal stability [

 <xref rid="B190-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>]. CuSO
 <sub>4</sub> was incorporated to form an ideal scaffold, as it helps to attain the fiber diameter and wettability beneficial for the growth of fibroblast cells. It also has the antimicrobial activity to suppress the invasion of microbes, which is necessary for wound healing [
 <xref rid="B191-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>]. Atomic force microscopy analysis revealed that the PO/PU/CuSO
 <sub>4</sub> nanofibers showed a smaller fiber morphology, resulting in a smooth surface essential for adherence and the growth of fibroblast cells [

 <xref rid="B192-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>,
 <xref rid="B193-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>]. In addition, the satisfactory porosity assisted in efficiently delivering nutrients and eliminating waste for superior attachment and growth [
 <xref rid="B188-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>]. The addition of PO improved the water-contact angle of PU, while the addition of CuSO
 <sub>4</sub> to the PU/PO reduced the water-contact angle. However, the polymer matrixâ€™s wettability improved, making it suitable for fibroblast adhesion [
 <xref rid="B194-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>]. After adding PEO and CuSO
 <sub>4</sub>, the tensile strength of the neat PU increased. The presence of PEO and CuSO
 <sub>4</sub> in the PU matrix deferred the time of blood clotting, which is advantageous for wound healing, as identified by an activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time assay [
 <xref rid="B195-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">195</xref>]. An MTS assay found that human dermal fibroblast cells were firmly attached and actively proliferated in all electrospun membranes compared to the control plates. It was also observed that the phenolic components assisted in preserving the fibroblasts against oxidative stress caused by hydrogen peroxide, thereby resulting in cell proliferation and migration [
 <xref rid="B196-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>,
 <xref rid="B197-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">197</xref>,
 <xref rid="B198-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">198</xref>]. Accordingly, the prepared wound-dressing composite was based on PU/PO and PU/PO/CuSO
 <sub>4</sub> due to their superior physicochemical and biocompatibility qualities, which rendered these fit for wound healing.
