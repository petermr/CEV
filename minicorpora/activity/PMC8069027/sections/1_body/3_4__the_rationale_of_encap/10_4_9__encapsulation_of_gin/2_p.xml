<p>Silva et al. fabricated ultrafine fibers by incorporating ginger essential oil (GEO) into zein (Z); polyethylene oxide (PEO), and soy protein isolate (SPI) polymers via electrospinning to restrain 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> growth in fresh Mina’s cheese [
 <xref rid="B251-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">251</xref>]. The GEO showed antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> 0157:H7, 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus,</italic> and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa.</italic> However, in comparison with other strains, 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> were too delicate to the action of GEO and exhibited the largest area of inhibition [
 <xref rid="B261-ijms-22-04017" ref-type="bibr">261</xref>]. For 
 <italic>Escherichia</italic> coli 0157:H7 and 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, GEO had a minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration at 2.3 μL.mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and 4.7 μL.mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. Despite GEO’s content, the ultrafine fibers prepared from the SPI-PEO-Z blend displayed cylindrical shapes with homogeneous morphology without any bead formation after the electrospinning. The average diameter of fibers increased as GEO concentration (3%, 6%, 9%, and 12%) increased. After penetration into polymers, the GEO’s thermal stability improved. The number of 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> on the fresh cheese decreased when the cheese was wrapped with fibers consisting of GEO as compared to cheese covered with fiberless packaging and fibers without GEO. The in situ analysis of the 12% GEO nanofiber revealed that active fibers could be an important and natural alternative for managing 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> in Mina’s fresh cheese during storage. In this report, it was noted that the oil incorporated in the fibers could extend its antimicrobial activity. Besides, the release of the essential oil compounds into the food through volatilization did not involve physical touch, which can reduce the unsatisfactory sensory characteristics that can occur in foods. Therefore, active fibers containing 12% of GEO provided a strong probability of being used to eliminate microbial contamination in food packaging.
