<p>Standard solutions of the 33 target compounds were first prepared in methanol at 1 mM concentrations, and solutions were gradually diluted in the mobile phase to the working concentrations that ranged from 0.01 to 50 μM. Each solution contained 16 phenolic acids, (caffeic, chlorogenic, trans-cinnamic, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic, ferulic, gallic, 3-hydroxybenzoic, 4-hydroxybenzoic, 5-hydroxyferulic, 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric, protocatechuic, rosmarinic, salicylic, sinapinic, syringic, and vanillic acid), 2 phenolic acid derivatives (p-methyl coumarate and salicylic acid 2-
 <italic>O</italic>-β-D-glucoside), and 15 flavonoids (apigenin, chrysin, galangin, kaempferol, myricetin, naringenin, pinocembrin, catechin, morin, hesperidin, rutin, quercitrin, naringin, luteolin, and quercetin). Each methanolic extract (50 μL) was evaporated to dryness and redissolved into 200 μL of the mobile phase, sonicated for 5 min, and centrifuged for 5 min at 12,400 rcf before injection. All standards and reagents were of the highest available purity and purchased from Sigma Aldrich Company (Czechia), and the measurements were performed in triplicate.
