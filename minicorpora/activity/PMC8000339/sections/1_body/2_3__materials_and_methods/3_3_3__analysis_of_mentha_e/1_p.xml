<p>The total phenolic content was spectrophotometrically determined according to the method of Singleton and Rosi [
 <xref rid="B71-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The data were calculated according to a standard curve of gallic acid (25–1000 μg/mL) and expressed as gallic acid equivalents (GAE) per gram of dry weight. Methanolic extracts (10-25 μL)were diluted with 6 mL of distilled water in a 10 mL volumetric flask; then, a 500 μL of Folin–Ciocalteu reagent (diluted with water 2:1, v:v right before use) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Then, 1.5 mL of 20% sodium carbonate solution was added, and the samples were made up to 10 mL with distilled water. The samples were incubated in the dark for 2 h, and the absorbance was spectrophotometrically measured at 765 nm (Spectrophotometer UV/VIS S-20, Boeco, Germany) against a blank. All measurements were performed in triplicate.
