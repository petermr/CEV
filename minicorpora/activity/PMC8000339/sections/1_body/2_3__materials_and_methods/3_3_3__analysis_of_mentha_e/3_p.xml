<p>UHPLC–MS/MS analyses were carried out using an Ultra Performance LCMS 8050 system (Shimadzu, Japan) with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with electrospray ionization (ESI) source operating in the negative mode. Lab Solutions software version 5.2 (Shimadzu Corporation, Japan) was used for instrument control, data acquisition, and processing. The sample solutions were injected into a reversed-phase column (Acquity BEH C18, 1.7 μm, 3.0 × 150 mm, Waters, Milford, MA, USA) with an appropriate pre-column. The separation and identification of phenolic compounds were performed according to the conditions described before [

Briefly, the mobile phase consisted of a mixture of aqueous solutions of 0.1% formic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid in methanol (solvent B) at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The column temperature was maintained at 40 °C. The linear gradient consisted of 5% B for 3 min, 5–25% B for 4 min, 25–30% B for 6 min, 30–35% B for 4 min, 35–60% B for 6 min, 60–100% for 4 min, isocratic for 1.5 min, back to 5% B within 0.1 min, and equilibration for 3.4 min. The back pressure ranged from 45 to 50 MPa during the chromatographic run. The effluent was introduced into an electrospray source (interface temperature of 300 °C, heat block temperature of 400 °C, and capillary voltage of 3.0 kV). Argon was used as the collision gas, and nitrogen was used as the nebulizing gas. To achieve a high specificity in addition to the high sensitivity, the analysis was performed in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode.
