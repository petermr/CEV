<p>The majority of 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> species tolerate a wide range of soil chemistry and conditions. The most important factors are neutral pH, organic content, overall water-holding capacity, and drain ability [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, environmental conditions not only strongly affect the quality of 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> essential oil but also phenylpropanoid composition. For example, the essential oils of 
 <italic>M. arvensis</italic> from Brazil, Taiwan, and China significantly differ in the contents of the major compounds menthol, and menthone. Additionally, considerable differences in the oil from 
 <italic>M. piperita</italic> of European origin were also found [

 <xref rid="B1-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In general, long warm days promote both phenolics and monoterpene synthesis and accumulation. Additionally, plant harvesting is an important factor that influences essential oil quality and quantity [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Plants harvested at the flowering stage usually have a higher concentration of menthol and its derivatives than plants harvested in the bud formation stage.
