<p>Species of the genus 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> are widely distributed in temperate and sub-temperate regions. The understanding of the systematics of this genus has been an extremely challenging and very complex task. Many studies have elucidated these problems [

 <xref rid="B16-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Taxonomic difficulties are mainly caused by a high incidence of polyploidy, variations in base chromosome number, diverse morphologies, vegetative propagation, and frequent interspecific hybridization [

 <xref rid="B18-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, chemical analysis is an important tool to help discriminate between the species of this genus [

 <xref rid="B19-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], although most of the commercially important mints are hybrids or amphiploids. The genus 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> (Lamiaceae) consists of eighteen species and eleven hybrids, which are separated into four sections: 
 <italic>Pulegium</italic>, 
 <italic>Tubulosae</italic>, 
 <italic>Eriodentes,</italic> and 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> [
 <xref rid="B5-plants-10-00550" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In general, species of the genus 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> are described as aromatic perennial plants with rhizomes or rhizomatous stems. Individual species differ in plant height (from small 
 <italic>Mentha x piperita</italic> var. 
 <italic>citrata</italic> to high 
 <italic>Mentha rotundifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>Mentha longifolia</italic> in leaf color (from light green, such as 
 <italic>Mentha spicata</italic>, to dark green with hints of purple, such as 
 <italic>M. x piperita</italic>), leaf length (short like 
 <italic>Mentha arvensis</italic> to long like 
 <italic>M. longifolia</italic>), leaf surface (from glabrous like 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic> to hairy like 
 <italic>M. longifolia</italic>), the shape of inflorescence (from the remote verticillasters of 
 <italic>Mentha pulegium</italic> to the dense spike-like inflorescence of 
 <italic>Mentha aquatica</italic>), and flower color (from nearly white to purple) [
