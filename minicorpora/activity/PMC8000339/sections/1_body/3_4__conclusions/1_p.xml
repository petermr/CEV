<p>The present study evaluated the phenolic profile, antioxidant properties, and enzyme inhibitory properties of thirteen 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> species of European origin, all grown under the same environmental conditions. Overall, the results demonstrated that the majority of investigated plants represent promising sources of food rich in natural antioxidants, as well as sources of active ingredient agents for the pharmaceutic and cosmetic industries. Data showed that not only 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic>, 
 <italic>M.</italic> x 
 <italic>piperita</italic>, and 
 <italic>M. arvensis</italic>, which are already implemented in food and pharmaceutical industries, but also other 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> species, such as 
 <italic>M. longifolia</italic>, 
 <italic>M. microphylla</italic>, and 
 <italic>M.</italic> x 
 <italic>villosa</italic> that are cultivated for ornamental purposes, have beneficial properties for humans. Citrus-scented 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> x 
 <italic>villosa</italic> might a good candidate, especially due to its easy cultivation.
