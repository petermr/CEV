<p>The investigated 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> species also revealed some activity to inhibit the enzyme tyrosinase. Among thirteen species, the methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> (123.89 ± 5.64 μg KAE/g) and 
 <italic>M. x piperita</italic> (102.82 ± 15.16 μg KAE/g) showed the highest activities (
