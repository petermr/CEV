<p>The single essential oils for each of the seven investigated MAPs were analyzed on a GCMS-QP2010 (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) gas chromatography-mass spectrometry system to determine their chemical composition. The separation of the compounds was achieved using a HP-5 MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., film thickness 0.25 μm; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The EOs of the most effective bi- and tripartite blends were analyzed on a GCMS-QP2010 (Shimadzu) gas chromatography-mass spectrometry system to determine their chemical composition. The separation of the compounds was achieved using an INNOWAX fused silica column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., film thickness: 0.25 μm; Agilent Technologies).</p>
