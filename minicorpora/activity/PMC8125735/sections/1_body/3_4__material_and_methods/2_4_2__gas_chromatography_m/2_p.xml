<p>All the samples were diluted with hexane (1:10, 
 <italic>v/v</italic>). For all samples, the injection volume was 1μL, in split mode (1:10) and the injector temperature was kept at 230 °C; Helium was the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>. The column temperature for the single-note EOs was programmed at a rate of 4 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> from 50 °C to 290 °C, and at a rate of 3 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> from 50 °C (20 min) to 250 °C for bi- and tripartite blends of EOs. For all samples, the temperatures of the GC–MS transfer line and ion source were maintained at 300 °C and 230 °C, respectively, while ionization was performed in the EI mode (70 eV), and full-scan mass spectra were acquired from m/z 100 to 600. Arithmetic indices for all compounds of single-note EOs were determined using 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes as standards [

 <xref rid="B41-molecules-26-02731" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], assisted also by data reported in scientific literature [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-26-02731" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. For all samples, the identity of several components in single or blended EOs was further confirmed by co-chromatography with authentic compounds. The relative percentage amounts of the separated compounds were calculated from the total ion chromatogram by a computerized integrator.
