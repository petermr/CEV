<p>Minimum Bactericidal Concentrations (MBC) were determined for the top-10 most effective EO blends showing the lowest IC
 <sub>50</sub> values. After repeating serial dilutions and IC
 <sub>50</sub> experiments for the specific blends, 10 μL were obtained from the different microcultures and transferred into a 384-well microplate containing fresh BHI medium. The microplate was incubated at 25 °C and bacterial growth was monitored for 22 h, as described above. MBC was determined as the lowest EO blend concentration yielding no bacterial growth. Six replicate measurements of MBC were performed for each blend.
