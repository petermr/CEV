<p>The chemical composition of the 127 blends was calculated using the mixing ratios and the corresponding compositions of pure EOs reported in our recent study [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-02731" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. To reveal putative relationships between EOs ingredients and their inhibitory activity against the target bacterial pathogen, a principal component analysis (PCA) was performed. A total of 36 compounds presenting a concentration higher than 0.5% in at least 30% of the 127 blends were used as active PCA variables, while the MIC values were also projected onto the PCA plot as a supplementary variable (i.e., not considered for the computation of the components). The PCA was conducted based on Pearsonâ€™s correlation matrix by using the XLSTAT software (version 2016; Addinsoft Inc., New York, NY, USA).
