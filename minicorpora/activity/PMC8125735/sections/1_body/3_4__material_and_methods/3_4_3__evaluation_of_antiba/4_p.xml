<p>Microplates were incubated at 25 °C (optimum growth temperature for 
 <italic>A. veronii</italic>) for 22 h and bacterial growth in each microculture was monitored by measuring optical density at 600 nm (OD600) every 20 min using a microplate reader (Infinite F200 PRO, Tecan GmbH, Grödig Austria). The area under the growth curve (i.e., OD600 vs. time) was integrated for each microdilution assay and the data were used for estimating half maximal concentration of each blended essential oil inhibiting 50% of bacterial growth (IC
 <sub>50</sub>). All experiments were performed in triplicate and the average IC
 <sub>50</sub> of each blend was derived. Growth controls (cell culture without EOs) and sterility controls (BHI broth without cells) were also included in every microplate that was assayed. In addition, treatment of bacterial cells with florfenicol and oxytetracycline, two standard antibiotics that are commonly administered to farmed fishes, were used as positive controls.
