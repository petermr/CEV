<p>The ability of each mixture to inhibit the growth of the pathogen 
 <italic>A. veronii</italic>, was evaluated using the broth microdilution method described in our previous studies [

 <xref rid="B43-molecules-26-02731" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This was based on the microplate procedure originally presented by Wiegand et al. [

 <xref rid="B45-molecules-26-02731" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] with some necessary modifications (e.g., Mueller-Hinton broth replaced by Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) medium). In brief, an overnight broth culture of 
 <italic>A. veronii</italic> was diluted with fresh BHI broth of 2× concentration to obtain a turbidity equal to 0.5 McFarland (i.e., ~10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU mL
 <sup>−1</sup>). The bacterial suspension was further diluted 1:100 with 2× BHI to achieve a cell density of ~10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. Each EO was first dissolved in DMSO and then diluted with water to a final stock concentration of 1600 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> (final DMSO concentration of 10%). Mixing of EOs in varying proportions (

 <sup>−1</sup>) and addition of bacterial suspension in BHI broth (50 μL in each well; 1× BHI final concentration) were performed using an automated liquid handling system (Biomek 2000; Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA).
