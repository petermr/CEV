<p>Blending was restricted to EOs from seven MAPs that were previously found to possess the most potent inhibitory activity against fish bacterial pathogens [

In order to investigate EOs blending in a systematic way and reveal how the proportions of various EOs affect antibacterial activity, a full simplex-centroid experimental mixture design was applied (Statgraphics Centurion 18, Statgraphics Technologies Inc., The Plains, VI, USA). This resulted in 127 combinations with each component varying from 0 to 100% (
