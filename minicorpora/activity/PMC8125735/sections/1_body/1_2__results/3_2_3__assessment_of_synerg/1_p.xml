<p>By taking into account the proportions and IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the seven EOs, the theoretical IC
 <sub>50</sub> of blends were calculated (on the basis of additive effects) and compared to the experimentally measured values. More specifically, the ratio between theoretical and measured inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50_T/M</sub>) was calculated for all 127 blends and the results were used to evaluate the additive (IC
 <sub>50_T/M</sub> = 1), synergistic (IC
 <sub>50_T/M</sub> &gt; 1) or antagonistic effects (IC
 <sub>50_T/M</sub> &lt; 1) in the different EOs combinations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02731-f004">Figure 4</xref>). For 46 blends the IC
 <sub>50_T/M</sub> values (0.81 to 1.29) were statistically indistinguishable from 1, implying additive antibacterial interactions between mixed EOs.
