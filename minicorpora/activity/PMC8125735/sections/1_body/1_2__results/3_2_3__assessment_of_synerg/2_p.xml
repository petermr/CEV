<p>More interestingly, a total of 71 combinations presented IC
 <sub>50_T/M</sub> ratios significantly higher than 1 (1.19 to 3.13), indicative of synergistic antibacterial effect, while antagonistic interactions between EOs were inferred only for three blends (IC
 <sub>50_T/M</sub>: 0.65 to 0.81). By far the highest value was observed for the 1:1 mixture of Greek oregano and wild carrot (blend #10; IC
 <sub>50_T/M</sub> = 3.1), for which the measured IC
 <sub>50</sub> was 68% lower than the theoretically calculated IC
 <sub>50</sub>. Similarly, the second highest ratio was found for the 1:1:1 mixture of Greek oregano, wild carrot and Spanish oregano (blend #38; IC
 <sub>50_T/M</sub> = 2.3), which presented 56% difference between measured and theoretical IC
 <sub>50</sub>. Both blends were included in the top-10 most potent blends against
