<p>It is interesting that in the blend #35 consisting of EOs from Greek oregano, rosemary and Spanish oregano (1:1:1), carvacrol was in less amount (33.15%) than those of the individual essential oils of Greek oregano (72.0%) and Spanish oregano (42.0%). Moreover, this blended preparation was rich in eucalyptol (20.15%), a major compound of pure rosemary essential oil (45.0%). In blends #10 and #38 (containing wild carrot EO), Î±-Pinene was one of their major compounds; however, this was in less amounts (18.44% and 13.14%, respectively) compared to that of the individual EO oil of wild carrot (20.5%).</p>
