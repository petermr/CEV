<p>The GC-MS analysis of pure EOs from the seven MAPs indicated 49 main constituents in total. The relative concentrations of individual components are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-02731">Table S1 (Supplementary Materials)</xref>. Among the Lamiaceae members, savoury, Greek oregano and Spanish oregano had several compounds in common, with 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (6.5 to 11.9%) and γ-terpinene (5.3 to 34.0%) being the main constituents after carvacrol (32.8% to 72.0%). Rosemary was found to be rich in eucalyptol (45.0%), camphor (11.5%) and α-pinene (8.8%), while pennyroyal contained pulegone (47.6%) and piperitenone (33.0%) as main components. In the wild carrot, isoeugenol methyl ether (14.8%), α-pinene (20.5%) and β-himachalene (21.6%) were detected at high levels. Lemon balm demonstrated a distinct chemical composition among EOs with citronellal (10.2%), γ-muurolene (12.6%) and β-caryophyllene (27.7%) being the main components.
