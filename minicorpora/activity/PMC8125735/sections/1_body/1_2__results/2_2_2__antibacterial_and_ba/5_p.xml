<p>The differences in the chemical composition of pure EOs and their blends as well as the interrelations of inhibitory activity with chemical constituents were further evaluated by principal component analysis (PCA). The first two principal components (PC1 and PC2) explained 31.7% and 23.3% of the total variance present in the dataset (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02731-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Interestingly, eight out of the top-10, most effective blends were clustered together in the outer part of the lower left quadrant of PCA scores plot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02731-f003">Figure 3</xref>a). The same area of PCA loadings plot was populated by carvacrol, γ- and α-terpinene, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, α-thujene, γ-terpinene and linalool, all of them being major shared constituents of Greek oregano, savoury and Spanish oregano (

 <sub>50</sub> vector was positioned in the diagonally opposite quadrant, implying the strong influence of those compounds to the increase of inhibitory activity against 
 <italic>A. veronii</italic> bv. 
 <italic>sobria</italic> (i.e., lower IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for higher levels of the specific compounds in the blends). The rest two blends (#10, #38) remained in the left side of the scores plot (i.e., opposite to IC
 <sub>50</sub> vector), but at the upper quadrant. Both of them contained wild carrot, the main compounds of which (e.g., α-pinene, β-himachalene, isoeugenol methyl ether, limonene) were also placed at the upper left panel of the loadings plot.
