<p>In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02731-f002">Figure 2</xref>a, the ten best-performing blends for bacterial growth inhibition are ranked hierarchically from the smallest to the highest IC
 <sub>50</sub>. When contrasted to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02731-f002">Figure 2</xref>b, it is apparent that a similar trend of gradually increasing bactericidal activity (MBC) applies for the blends #2, #10, #38, #16 and #35. On the other hand, the blends #31, #5, #8 as well as the blends #11 and #1 representing different combinations of Greek oregano, Spanish oregano and savoury deviated from the IC
 <sub>50</sub> pattern and showed comparatively lower MBC values than anticipated.
