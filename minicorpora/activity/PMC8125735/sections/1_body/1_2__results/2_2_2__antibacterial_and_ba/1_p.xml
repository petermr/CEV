<p>The seven EOs were effectively mixed at various proportions and a total of 127 blends were prepared and tested against 
 <italic>A. veronii</italic>. The growth inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of the different blends varied by an order of magnitude (43.4 to 397.5 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>), providing a median value of 123.3 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02731-f001">Figure 1</xref>). With regard to the top-10, most effective blends, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> diverged much less and varied from 43.4 to 62.8 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02731-f002">Figure 2</xref>a). Despite this limited variability, statistically significant differences were evident in the inhibitory activity of specific blends. In particular, the solution #2, which corresponded to pure EO from savoury (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-02731">Table S2, Supplementary Materials</xref>) exhibited the highest antibacterial activity (43.4 ± 3.9 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) with a statistically significant difference in comparison with all other blends tested (t-test, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The blend #10 containing EOs from Greek oregano and wild carrot in equal proportions provided the second strongest inhibition against 
 <italic>A. veronii</italic>, with its IC
 <sub>50</sub> value (51.1 ± 1.6 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) also being statistically different from those of the other mixtures (

 <sub>50</sub> values having a relative standard variation of about 5% and the majority of pairwise differences barely reaching statistical significance (
