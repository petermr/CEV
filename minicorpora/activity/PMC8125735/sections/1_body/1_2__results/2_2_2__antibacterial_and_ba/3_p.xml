<p>More complicated blends containing four to seven different EOs showed comparatively decreased effectiveness against 
 <italic>A. veronii</italic> and they were totally absent from the top-10 list. The ten blends with the highest inhibitory activity were further tested for their ability to cause complete eradication of 
 <italic>A. veronii</italic>. The minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of the examined blends ranged from 116 to 207 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02731-f002">Figure 2</xref>b) and they were two to four times higher than the corresponding IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02731-f002">Figure 2</xref>a). Blends #5, #31 and #8 exhibited marginal differences in terms of bactericidal activity and their MBC values (116 to 123 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) were significantly lower compared to all other blends. Interestingly, the top-2 hits (#31 and #8) were blends of Greek oregano, savoury and Spanish oregano, while the third hit (#5) was the only consisting of a pure EO (i.e., Spanish oregano). Among the other seven blends, the MBC values varied by less than 9% (161 to 207 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) and they were at least 30% higher compared to the group of the three most effective combinations.
