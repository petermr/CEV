<p>In this study, individual EOs of seven Greek native MAPs and numerous mixtures thereof in all possible combinations (blends of two to seven MAPs in equal proportions) were assessed for their antimicrobial properties against the fish bacterial pathogen 
 <italic>A. veronii</italic> bv. 
 <italic>sobria</italic>. Additive and synergistic growth-inhibiting properties were observed in most of the mixtures examined, with the EOs blend of Greek oregano and wild carrot exhibiting the greatest synergistic action. On the other hand, antagonistic interactions were evident only in a few mixtures characterized by the combined presence of rosemary, lemon balm and pennyroyal. Greek oregano, savoury and Spanish oregano EOs were the most effective ones when applied either in pure form or blended with other EOs. With regard to their blends, the combination of EOs from Greek oregano and wild carrot, as well as the combinations of those two with Spanish oregano or savoury (all in equal proportions) were among the most potent ones against bacterial growth. Overall, the choice of the best EOs mixture against 
 <italic>A. veronii</italic> bv. 
 <italic>sobria</italic> depends on whether the main purpose is to inhibit its growth or achieve its complete eradication. For growth inhibition, the pure EO from savoury (blend #2) and the mixture of Greek oregano and wild carrot EOs (blend #10) represent the best options. However, blended EOs of Greek oregano and savoury EOs (blend #8), as well as Greek oregano, Spanish oregano and savoury EOs blend (#31) are more efficient in achieving the complete eradication of the study pathogen. If both inhibition and/or complete suppression of bacterial activity is the aim, the blends #5, #8 and #31 are the best ones, showing consistently low values for both IC
 <sub>50</sub> and MBC, with Greek/Spanish oregano being the common EO in all three blends, and carvacrol being their most abundant chemical compound. For growth inhibition of the studied pathogen, pure savoury EO and the mixture of Greek oregano and wild carrot EOs represent the best options; for its complete eradication, the blended Greek oregano and savoury EOs as well as Greek oregano, Spanish oregano and savoury EOs blend are more efficient. If both inhibition and eradication are aimed, the two latter blends and pure Spanish oregano EO are highly effective (all with abundant carvacrol content). Undoubtedly, further in vivo tests are required to verify the applicability and effectiveness of this alternative antibacterial agent under real fish farming conditions. In practice, fish feeds supplemented with various levels of the aforementioned best-performing EO blends should be prepared and used in infected fish to reveal whether these natural plant products are effective in farmed fish without side effects for large-scale curative and/or preventive treatments.
