<p>Several pure EOs from single MAP species have been tested to date for their antimicrobial activity against microbial pathogens of aquaculture environments with promising results [

 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-02731" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, there is limited knowledge regarding the antimicrobial activity of blended EOs [

 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-02731" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-02731" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The particular interest for blending relies on the concept that the combination of EOs from two or more MAPs may result in a product with greater bacteriostatic or bactericidal efficacy than each individual EO alone. This is possible due to the synergistic effects that may arise from the coupling of chemical components from the different EOs. On the other hand, the combination of EOs may also lead to simply additive or even antagonistic effects. In this context, the activities of various EO mixtures are typically examined and the results are usually contrasted with the effects of single EOs and/or dominant compounds thereof [

 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-02731" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In general, any detected interaction (synergistic, additive or antagonistic) between two compounds of a single EO or between two or more EOs in a mixture depends on the concentrations of individual components or single EOs [

 <xref rid="B32-molecules-26-02731" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], the studies dealing with blends of EOs tested against microbial pathogens of the aquaculture sector still remain scarce to date [
