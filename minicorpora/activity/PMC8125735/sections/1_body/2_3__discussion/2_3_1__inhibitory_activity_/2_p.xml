<p>Unexpectedly, the mixture of Greek oregano, savoury and Spanish oregano (1:1:1, blend #31, which were the most carvacrol-rich EOs was not the most effective blend against the tested bacterial strain. The inhibitory activity of this blend was ranked fourth among all 127 combinations and it was lower than the activity of savoury EO, but higher than those of pure EOs from Greek and Spanish oregano. Interestingly, the 1:1 combination of Greek oregano with Spanish oregano (blend #11) exhibited nearly additive effect (ratio = 0.99), showing slightly higher antimicrobial activity compared to single-note EO of Greek oregano. Similarly, the blend of Greek oregano with savoury (blend #8) and the one composed of Spanish oregano with savoury (blend #16) were deemed to exhibit additive interactions since their IC
 <sub>50_T/M</sub> ratios (i.e., 0.93 and 0.81, respectively) were not statistically different from 1 (at
