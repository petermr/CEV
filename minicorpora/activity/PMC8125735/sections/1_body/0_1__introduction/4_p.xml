<p>Despite the research progress in testing antibacterial efficacy of EOs from various MAPs and of their isolated major components, there are limited studies focusing on potential antagonistic, additive or synergistic effect of mixed EOs from different MAPs or other sources [

 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-02731" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, it remains largely unclear whether the antimicrobial effects of individual EOs is retained or even increase once these are blended with EOs from other MAPs [
