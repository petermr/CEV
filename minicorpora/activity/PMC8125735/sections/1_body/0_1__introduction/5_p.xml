<p>To date, there are only few studies investigating the effect of EOs and their individual components against

 <italic>veronii</italic> bv.

 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-02731" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Additionally, there is only limited knowledge regarding the complex interactions of blended EOs from different MAPs against the specific pathogen [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-02731" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In this context, the primary aim of the present study was to investigate possible synergistic antimicrobial effects of mixed EOs from selected MAPs of Greece against 
 <italic>A. veronii</italic> bv. 
 <italic>sobria</italic>. Our investigation was specifically focused on EOs from seven MAPs that showed the greatest inhibitory activity against bacterial fish pathogens in a previous screening study [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-02731" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. To this end, a total of 127 combinations of EOs from the seven selected MAPs were prepared and were tested in vitro against 
 <italic>A. veronii</italic> bv. 
 <italic>sobria</italic>. A secondary aim of this study was to evaluate whether blending of these EOs can result in an enhancement of antimicrobial activity against the selected bacterial fish pathogen. To address this aim, we systematically examined the inhibitory and bactericidal activities of EOs blends and compared them to those of pure counterparts.
