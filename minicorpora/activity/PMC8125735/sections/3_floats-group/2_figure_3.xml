  <p>Principal component analysis scores plot (
   <bold>a</bold>) and loadings plot (
   <bold>b</bold>) derived from the compositional data of the 127 essential oilsâ€™ blends examined (see 
   <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-02731">Table S1 Supplementary Materials</xref>). The blue dots reflect the differences in the chemical composition of individual blends, while the red vectors represent the 36 chemical compounds of the essential oils that were used as active variables. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
   <sub>50</sub>) of the blends against 
   <italic>Aeromonas veronii</italic> bv. 
   <italic>sobria</italic> is also projected on the loading plot (blue vector; supplementary variable).
