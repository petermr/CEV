  <p>The following are available online, Table S1: Main constituents and percentage content of essential oils (EOs) from seven Greek native medicinal-aromatic plants (MAPs) tested in vitro against 
   <italic>Aeromonas veronii</italic> bv. 
   <italic>sobria.</italic> *GO: Greek oregano; *S: Savoury; R: Rosemary; WC: Wild carrot; *SO: Spanish oregano; P: Pennyroyal; L: Lemon balm (for the origin of the material see 
   <xref rid="molecules-26-02731-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The EOs content in bold letters from MAPs marked with asterisk (*) were evaluated as highly effective single-note EOs against the studied fish pathogen (from Anastasiou et al. 2020, with modifications); Figure S1: GC-MS Chromatograms of the most effective bi- and tripartite blends of essential oils (EOs) tested in vitro against 
   <italic>Aeromonas veronii</italic> bv. 
   <italic>sobria</italic> after evaluation of 127 preparations using EOs of seven Greek native medicinal-aromatic plants and their combinations. For the percentage content of the most effective blended essential oil preparations see
