<p id="Par22">The treatment of (NPKb) + U50% exhibited the highest rate of superoxide radical scavenging (59.50%) as compared to the lowest (47.62%) in control. The treatment of (NPKb) + U50% differed from the other treatments significantly. Also, the plants varied insignificantly in these traits when they were treated with (Nb) + U50% or (Pb) + U50%. The comparison of the means indicated that the superoxide radical scavenging rate was increased by 24.96%, 19.63%, and 17.46% versus the control plants (Fig.
