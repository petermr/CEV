<p id="Par47">Before the experiment, the soil was sampled from a depth of 0–30 cm for analysis (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Then, the plots were leveled and prepared in dimensions of 3 × 2.5 m
 <sup>2</sup>. Each plot was composed of 12 sowing rows spaced by 25 cm with an on-row spacing of 15 cm. The seeds were sown on March 11, 2017, and emerged with rainwater. The first irrigation was performed 2 weeks after sowing. Thinning and soil addition were performed on May 10, 2017 (thinning is the picking out the overpopulated plants in the early growing stage from a row to reach appropriate density and to ensure plants have adequate space, earthing up or ridging is the method for piling soil up around the base of a plant. This technique is used to stimulate plants growth and stabilize plants stem to avoid lodging).
