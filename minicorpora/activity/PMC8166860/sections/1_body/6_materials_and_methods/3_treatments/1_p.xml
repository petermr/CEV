<p id="Par48">The study was carried out on the basis of a randomized block design (RBD) with 10 treatments and three replications. The treatments included control (no fertilization), U (100% chemical fertilizer as urea at 53.3 kg ha
 <sup>−1</sup>, Nb (Biofertilizer, Azotobacter vinelandii), Pb (Biofertilizer, Pantoea agglomerans and Pseudomonas putida), Kb (Biofertilizer, Bacillus spp.), NPKb (NPK, biofertilizer), Nb + 50% U, Pb + 50% U, Kb + 50% U and NPKb + 50% U. The plants were sown at a density of 40 plants per square meter or 400,000 plants per hectare. AzotoBarvar-1 contained 
 <italic>Azotobacter vinelandii</italic> (strain O4), an obligate aerobic free-living gram-negative soil bacterium that fixes soil N. PhopshoBarvar-2 contained two types of phosphate solubilizing bacteria, 
 <italic>Pantoea agglomerans</italic> (strain P5) and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> (strain P13), which use the secretion of organic acids and phosphatase acids to hydrolyze insoluble P compounds. PotaBarvar-2 included two types of 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. bacteria solubilizing K. The microorganisms in this fertilizer decompose insoluble K compounds in the soil around the rhizosphere and release this cation.
