<p id="Par11">The highest and lowest seed yields per plant were observed in the treatment of (NPKb) + U50% (4.88 g m
 <sup>−2</sup>) and the control (2.48 g m
 <sup>−2</sup>), respectively. The treatment of (NPKb) + U50% had a statistically significant difference from all other treatments. The plants treated with (NPKb) + U50% and those treated with (Pb) + U50% showed 96.67% and 79.20% higher seed yield per plant than the control (Fig.
