<p id="Par16">The highest biological yield of 15.48 g m
 <sup>−2</sup> was obtained from the treatment of U and the lowest one of 9.79 g m
 <sup>−2</sup> from the control. The treatment of U differed from the other treatments significantly. The treatments of U and (NPKb) + U50% improved biological yield by 58% and 36.83% versus the control, respectively when compared to the control (Fig.
