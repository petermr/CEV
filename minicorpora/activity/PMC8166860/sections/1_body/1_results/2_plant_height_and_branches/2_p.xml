<p id="Par8">The highest and lowest branch diameters (15.62 and 14.23 cm) were obtained from the plants treated with (NPKb) + U50% and those treated with (NPKb), respectively. The plants inoculated with (NPKb) + U50% and U exhibited 9.71% and 9.01% higher branch diameter than the plants treated with (NPKb), respectively. There was no significant difference between (NPKb) + U50%, (Nb) + U50% and U treatments (Fig.
