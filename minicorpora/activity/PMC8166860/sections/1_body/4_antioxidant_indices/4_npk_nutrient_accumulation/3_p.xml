<p id="Par44">The enhancement in alona leaf potassium was attributed to the combined use of organic and chemical fertilizers, which can in turn increase and improve soil properties and characteristics, resulting in well rooting and absorption of potassium. Similar results have been observed in the NPK contents of dill plants treated with combined bio-chemical fertilizers
