 </sup> found that a combination of chemical fertilizers, as well as phosphorus and nitrogen biofertilizers, increased the leaf P content of roselle. Also, the use of biological phosphorus fertilizers increased plant nutrition absorption and leaf nitrogen, as well as the growth parameters of tomato plants
