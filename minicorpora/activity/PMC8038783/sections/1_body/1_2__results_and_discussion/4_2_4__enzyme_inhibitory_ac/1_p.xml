<p>Obesity, dyslipidemia, glycemic index imbalance, glucose intolerance, or hypertension are early signs of the possible development of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes. A possible alternative to reduce postprandial hyperglycemia is the inhibition of key associated enzymes to type 2 diabetes, such as α-amylase and α-glucosidase [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-26-02100" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. To control blood glucose levels, inhibition of these enzymes is an important strategy. However, the main drawback of the inhibitors currently used, such as acarbose and voglibose, is their side effects such as diarrhea, abdominal bloating, and flatulence [

OV ADAR’s extract showed a potential effect on the restraint of α-amylase activity (44.71 ± 0.86 µg/mL) and exerted much more powerful α-glucosidase inhibition (7.11 ± 1.37 µg/mL) than Acarbose, a reference compound used in the clinical treatment of diabetes. On the other hand, oregano extract presented a low inhibitory activity on pancreatic lipase (922.35 ± 30.99 µg/mL), compared to positive control Orlistat
