<p>The ferric reducing antioxidant power of the samples was determined according to described by Parra et al. [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-26-02100" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], with some modifications. In a 96-well microplate, 25 µL of stock solution was mixed with 175 µL of FRAP reagent. The mixture was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C, and absorption was recorded at 593 nm in a Synergy™ HTX multimodal microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA). Data were expressed as µmol TE/100 g DW. Trolox is used as standard and ethanol 80%
