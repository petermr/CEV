<p>Plant extracts represent a good alternative to the most common antioxidants conventionally used for sperm preservation. Among these traditional antioxidants, many of them are isolated from plants (e.g., epicatechin gallate, quercetin, aspalathin), as their inclusion in the semen extender is not profitable because of their high price. Moreover, these compounds are normally employed individually, while the use of plant extracts, as a whole, can provide a large set of secondary metabolites (e.g., phenols, terpenoids, etc.) with a powerful antioxidant effect and antimicrobial properties [

 <xref rid="B98-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Recent advances in phytotherapy research have brought promising applications related to drug delivery. For instance, plant cells cultured in vitro release extracellular vesicles (EVs) that can be easily harvested for pharmaceutical practice [
 <xref rid="B99-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Considering that some plant EVs have shown inhibitory effects against pathogenic microorganisms [
 <xref rid="B99-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>], they may be studied as possible substitutes for antibiotics in the semen preservation process. Recently, several studies reported that some polyphenols can modulate cellular metabolic pathways and transform some compounds into others, exerting not only potent antioxidant effects but also a cascade of secondary protective effects [

 <xref rid="B101-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Some polyphenols have been shown to modulate the sperm metabolism by increasing the efficiency of mitochondrial respiration [

However, the source of the raw plant material, the extraction method, and the concentration of the plant extract play an important role in its effects on the sperm cell. Thus, there are many factors that affect the active constituents of plants, such as the plant age, environment (temperature, altitude, soil, rainfall, etc.), collection, processing, and storage. The different extraction methods also influence the phytochemical profile of the extract, even if using the same amount and source of plant. Moreover, the variety of plant types available on the market (e.g., fermented or unfermented, leaves or buds, etc.) exert different effects on sperm cells [
 <xref rid="B53-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="B93-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>] because, for example, plant fermentation induces quantitative changes in the phenolic composition [
 <xref rid="B102-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. The part of the plant (e.g., root, bark, stem, leaf, flower, pollen, fruit) used to make the extracts is another factor to bear in mind because it may affect the chemical composition of the extract and thus its possible effects on sperm function. The selection of the plant extract concentration to be used in the sperm samples is an important step and is also influenced by the extraction method employed. Thus, in the view of the data presented in the present work, the same plant species can exert negative or positive effects on sperm parameters, in the same animal species, depending on the extract concentration employed. It is also important to bear in mind that the same concentration of plant extract can have different effects on sperm parameters depending on the preservation method used (e.g., refrigeration vs. cryopreservation). For instance, at the same concentration, 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> extract increases shrimp sperm survival during refrigeration but not after freezing and thawing [
 <xref rid="B72-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,
 <xref rid="B73-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. This could be due to the different stresses that each preservation method exerts on spermatozoa. The cryopreservation process is considered the most harmful preservation method because of the additional damages (e.g., mechanical damage) caused to the sperm’s structure. These mechanical damages might not be prevented by the action of some plant extracts. However, the addition of some plant extracts (e.g., 
 <italic>A. vera</italic>) can be more appropriate for the cryopreservation process, as substitutes of cryoprotectants such as egg yolk [
 <xref rid="B43-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], than for the refrigeration of sperm samples. Due to all the aforementioned factors, it is important to standardize the production process of plants intended for use as phytopharmaceuticals [
 <xref rid="B103-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>] and the working protocols in andrology laboratories. Moreover, it is advisable to increase the production of plant breeding lines for use as phytopharmaceuticals, where the product’s traceability is ensured (e.g., abiotic factors, nonuse of pesticides). Under such controlled conditions, the chemical profile of the extract could be more stable, thereby allowing standardization of the suitable concentrations to be used for sperm preservation. Additional studies that also involve fertility trials are desirable to further support the extensive incorporation of these natural compounds into sperm diluents. Even though the use of plant extracts as preservatives for semen storage is in its infancy, their use is promising and they can be considered natural and profitable alternatives to the most common additives currently used for sperm preservation.
