<p>The use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) is nowadays a common praxis applied to livestock breeding, wildlife conservation, and human fertility treatment. Artificial insemination (AI), which entails the collection and processing of the male gamete, is the ART most popularly applied to domestic animals thanks to the several advantages that it provides to the breeders compared to natural mating. For instance, AI favors the interchange of genetic lines and, the selection of the best-quality sires by the creation of germplasm banks, while it helps to considerably reduce the spread of disease and increases the animals’ reproductive performance. Furthermore, due to the accelerated biodiversity loss, ARTs are of paramount interest in conservation breeding programs (CBPs). Within the most threatened vertebrate taxa are amphibians and freshwater fishes. Thus, for instance, the use of cryopreserved sperm in amphibians from CBPs allows the fertilization of a single female’s spawn with spermatozoa from many genetically diverse males without the need of animal transport [

In humans, the employment of ARTs is increasing considerably due to the significant growth in infertility cases in the last few decades. Moreover, semen cryopreservation is the most suitable option to preserve the fertility of men undergoing cancer treatment [

In this sense, it is important to optimize the protocols for semen storage by increasing sperm life span without compromising sperm function. This would translate into increased fertilization rates in AI outcomes. Plant extracts have recently emerged as a cheap and natural source of additives to preserve and enhance sperm function during semen storage. Most plant species are considered powerful sources of antioxidants, which can act as reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers for palliating the deleterious effects of oxidative stress on sperm function. Moreover, these natural compounds can have antimicrobial properties and increase the activity of several antioxidant enzymes. The present work aims to provide an overview of the use of plant extracts as natural compounds for sperm preservation in different animal species (including humans) and their effects on sperm function. Extraction methods, suitable concentrations to be used for the different species evaluated, and the possible side effects of the plant extracts are also provided.
