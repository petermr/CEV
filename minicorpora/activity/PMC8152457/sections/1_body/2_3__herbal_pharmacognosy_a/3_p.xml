<p>As previously discussed, semen preservation (especially cryopreservation) promotes damage to sperm structure and thus to sperm function. Moreover, the overproduction of ROS during sperm storage can lead to oxidative stress, compromising the sperm integrity and fertilizing ability. In order to palliate these undesirable side effects of sperm storage, several compounds have been added to the semen extender in order to optimize the preservation protocols. Most of these substances are chemically synthesized and their prices are usually elevated (especially some antioxidants). On the other hand, in the last two decades, the use of plant extracts, as an economic and natural source of antioxidants, has become a new approach for the preservation of semen, with promising results.</p>
