<p>Pharmacognosy is defined as the study of drugs from natural sources such as microorganisms, plants, fungi, and animals. Thus, herbal pharmacognosy (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B21-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]) is focused on the study of plants and their derived compounds as possible therapeutic agents. For thousands of years, plants have been used as drugs to treat numerous illnesses (wounds, burns, and insect bites), being the basis of many modern medicines and a source of new drugs in pharmacology. Plants produce a wide range of chemical compounds (phytochemicals) that protect them against potential pathogens (bacteria, fungi, viruses), herbivores, and pests as well as attracting pollinators and facilitating symbiosis with other organisms. These phytochemicals are known as secondary metabolites and are derived from primary metabolites (involved in normal growth, development, and reproduction) such as carbohydrates, lipids, and amino acids, among others. Secondary metabolites have been widely used by humans (e.g., pigments, condiments, medicines) and are the main compounds responsible for the pharmacological activity of plants. Many drugs currently used in modern medicine (atropine, codeine, morphine, taxol, etc.) are derived from plant secondary metabolites. The major groups of secondary metabolites found in plants include alkaloids, phenolic compounds, and terpenoids. Numerous valuable properties such as antioxidants, antimicrobial, antiviral, antitumor, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic, and antiparasitic have been linked to these compounds.
