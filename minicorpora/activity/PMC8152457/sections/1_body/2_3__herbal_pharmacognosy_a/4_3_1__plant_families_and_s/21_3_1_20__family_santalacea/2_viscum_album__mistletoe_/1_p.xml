 <xref rid="B85-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. The range of concentrations used was from 2 to 10 mg/mL. Only at the initial time of sperm incubation (0 h) was an increase in sperm motility and velocity observed. Moreover, during the following incubation times, the lowest concentrations did not show any positive effects, but detrimental effects were observed at the highest concentrations used in several sperm parameters.
