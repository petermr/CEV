<p>Clove bud has been employed as an additive to different types of extenders for ram sperm cryopreservation [
 <xref rid="B78-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. The tested extract concentrations ranged from 35 to 115 µg/mL. Sperm motility and kinetics, viability, and membrane integrity were better preserved by this plant extract during semen cooling and after thawing in comparison with the control group. The suitable range of extract concentrations was from 35 to 75 µg/mL. On the other hand, a concentration of 115 µg/mL had deleterious effects on sperm function.
