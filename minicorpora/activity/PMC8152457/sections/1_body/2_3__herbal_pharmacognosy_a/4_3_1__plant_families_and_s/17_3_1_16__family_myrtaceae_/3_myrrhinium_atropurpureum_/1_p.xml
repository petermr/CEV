 <xref rid="B76-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] at 17 Â°C. Among the four concentrations used, two of them (0.1% and 1%) showed cytotoxic effects immediately after their addition to the culture media. A concentration of 0.01% had deleterious effects on sperm parameters after 2 h of semen incubation. The remaining concentration employed (0.001%) had neither positive nor negative results on sperm function. None of the concentrations tested had inhibitory effects on bacterial growth (
