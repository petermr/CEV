<p>The essential oil of this plant has been tested on boar spermatozoa [
 <xref rid="B64-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,
 <xref rid="B75-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] incubated at 16 °C for 3 h at a range of concentrations from 0.2 to 2 mg/mL. While some concentrations did not significantly affect sperm parameters, others had a negative impact. On the other hand, even though a concentration of 0.4 mg/L did not show an enhancement of sperm parameters, it exerted a similar antimicrobial effect to that of ampicillin in boar semen stored at 16 °C for 120 h.
