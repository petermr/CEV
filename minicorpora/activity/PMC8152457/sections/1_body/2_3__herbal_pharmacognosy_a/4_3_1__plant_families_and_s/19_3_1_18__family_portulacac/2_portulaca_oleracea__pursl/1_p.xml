<p>This plant extract has been employed for goat semen cryopreservation [
 <xref rid="B82-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Different extraction methods and concentrations (25, 50, and 100 µg/mL) were used. Pursley extract had positive effects on several sperm parameters (motility, viability, mitochondrial activity, plasma membrane and DNA integrity) and reduced the MDA content in the semen samples when compared to the control group. The most suitable concentration was 50 µg/mL and the best results were obtained with the methanolic extract. However, some concentrations (from different extraction methods) were detrimental for sperm parameters.
