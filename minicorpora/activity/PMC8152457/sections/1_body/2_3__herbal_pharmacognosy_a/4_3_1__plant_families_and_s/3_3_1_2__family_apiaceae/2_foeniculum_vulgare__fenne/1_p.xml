<p>This plant has been used as an additive for boar [
 <xref rid="B37-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and ram [
 <xref rid="B38-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] semen diluents during sperm cryopreservation. In boar, ejaculated sperm were frozen by using three concentrations of fennel (2.5, 5, and 10 g/100 mL). The plant extract had positive effects on sperm motility and viability, especially at the highest concentration tested. Moreover, the two highest concentrations reduced the malondialdehyde (MDA) content of the sperm samples when compared to the control group. In ram, semen was cryopreserved by the use of three extract concentrations: 5, 10, and 15 mg/mL. Fennel improved several sperm parameters, such as viability, motility, kinetics, plasma membrane integrity, and mitochondrial activity, and reduced the MDA content. The most suitable extract concentration for the cryopreservation of ram semen was 10 mg/mL at a concentration of 200 Ã— 10
 <sup>6</sup> sperm/mL.
