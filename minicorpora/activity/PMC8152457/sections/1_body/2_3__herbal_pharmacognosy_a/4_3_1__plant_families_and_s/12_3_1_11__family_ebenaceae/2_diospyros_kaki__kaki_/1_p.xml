<p>The pulp of this plant exerted beneficial effects on bull sperm parameters during semen chilling and after freezing and thawing [
 <xref rid="B51-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The extract concentrations employed ranged from 1% to 10%. There was an improvement in sperm motility during 11 days of semen storage at 5 Â°C. After semen thawing, this plant showed positive effects on sperm motility and membrane integrity. The best results on sperm parameters were obtained through the use of concentrations ranging from 1% to 6%. Moreover, a higher conception rate was observed in cows inseminated with semen samples treated with this pulp fruit at concentrations of 2%, 4%, and 6%.
