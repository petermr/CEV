<p>The ebony family comprises more than 600 species, which are the source of several products with economic importance, such as timber (ebony) and fruits (e.g., persimmon). The family includes trees and shrubs, most of which are evergreen, and some are deciduous. The members of this group are distributed in pantropical regions, with a few species in temperate regions. The fruit is acutely astringent in all species until it is ripe.</p>
