<p>The rhizomes of this plant have been used as additives for the cryopreservation of ram epididymal sperm [
 <xref rid="B45-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and shrimp spermatophores. Ram sperm were cryopreserved by using a Tris egg yolk diluent supplemented with three concentrations of ginger extract (5, 10, and 20 mg/L). After sperm thawing, several parameters (viability, motility, velocity, acrosome integrity, and mitochondrial activity) were enhanced by this plant extract when compared with the control group. Moreover, the MDA levels were lower in the samples treated with this plant. The best results were obtained by the addition of 5 and 10 mg/L of this plant extract to the semen extender. Moreover, the cleavage rate was markedly higher in matured oocytes fertilized with frozen semen treated with 20 mg/L. On the other hand, the sperm samples treated with this plant showed a higher ratio of sperm chromatin dispersion. In shrimp [
