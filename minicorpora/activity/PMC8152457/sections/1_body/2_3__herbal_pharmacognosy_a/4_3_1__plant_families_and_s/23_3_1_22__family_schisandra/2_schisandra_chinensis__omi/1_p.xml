<p>This plant has been tested on bull semen [
 <xref rid="B87-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] stored for 24 h at room temperature (22–25 °C). Within the different concentrations tested (1–75 µg/mL), those within the range of 5–50 µg/mL showed antioxidant properties and exerted the best effects on sperm parameters. Thus, sperm motility and mitochondrial activity were enhanced by this plant extract. Moreover, lipid peroxidation, ROS production levels, and protein oxidation were significantly lower in the samples treated with this plant extract in comparison with the control group. None of the concentrations employed exerted negative effects on sperm function. Moreover, the omija extract exerted antibacterial activity against several species, being more effective against Gram-positive bacteria.
