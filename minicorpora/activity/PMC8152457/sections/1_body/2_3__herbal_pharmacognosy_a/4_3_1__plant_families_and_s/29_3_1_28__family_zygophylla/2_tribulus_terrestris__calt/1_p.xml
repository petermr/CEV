<p>In humans, this plant extract has been added to the semen extender before sperm cryopreservation and after thawing [
 <xref rid="B96-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. An improvement in sperm motility and viability was detected when it was added after semen thawing. The concentrations used were 20, 40, and 50 Âµg/mL, and the best results were obtained with the two highest concentrations. None of the concentrations used had deleterious effects on sperm parameters.
