<p>Boar spermatozoa were frozen using an extender supplemented with this plant [
 <xref rid="B50-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] in a range of concentrations from 0.25 to 2 mg/mL. After semen thawing, there was an enhancement in several sperm parameters, such as motility, acrosome and membrane integrity, and mitochondrial activity. Related to biochemical assays, this plant extract also improved SOD levels. The most suitable extract concentration was 0.5 mg/mL. However, the highest extract concentrations exerted a significant decrease in several sperm parameters in comparison with the control group.
