<p>This plant extract has been used for the cryopreservation of banana shrimp spermatophores and ram spermatozoa. In banana shrimp [
 <xref rid="B72-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], moringa extract had no detrimental or positive effects on sperm function after spermatophore thawing. However, the addition of this extract to the sperm extender promoted a reduction in bacterial abundance in cryo-stored spermatophores. The extract concentration used was 0.1 mg/mL. This plant extract (0.1 mg/mL) has been also employed during cool storage (2–4 °C for 28 days) of banana shrimp spermatophores [
 <xref rid="B73-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. This plant exerts positive effects on sperm survival together with the complete elimination of several bacterial contaminants. In ram [
 <xref rid="B74-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], the addition of this plant to the freezing extender exerted positive effects on several sperm parameters after semen thawing. Thus, an extract concentration within 0.5–5 mg/mL had a protective effect on sperm motility and membrane integrity together with increased antioxidant activity of the semen samples. The best results were obtained with the lowest extract concentration (0.5 mg/mL).
