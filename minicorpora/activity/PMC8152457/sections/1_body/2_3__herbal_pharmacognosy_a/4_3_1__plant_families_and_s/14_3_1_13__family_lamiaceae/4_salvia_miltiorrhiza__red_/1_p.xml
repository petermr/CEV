<p>This plant has been used as an additive to the semen extender prior to boar sperm freezing at five extract concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 1 mg/mL [
 <xref rid="B60-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. After semen thawing, there was an enhancement in several sperm parameters (motility, membrane and acrosome integrity, and mitochondrial activity), enzymatic activities (SOD; lactate dehydrogenase, LDH; glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, GOT; and CAT), and fertility outcomes (pregnancy rate and litter size). The optimal concentration for boar semen cryopreservation was 0.4 mg/mL.
