<p>When added to the freezing media, this plant extract enhanced the linearity (LIN) and straightness (STR) of sperm trajectory just after boar semen thawing [
 <xref rid="B39-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. During sperm incubation for 120 min at 37 °C, there were no significant effects on sperm kinetics. Otherwise, lemon balm reduced the MDA content in the semen samples after thawing. The most suitable concentration for boar semen is within 2.5–5 g/L.
