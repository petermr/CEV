<p>This plant extract has been employed as an additive for semen preservation in bull [

 <xref rid="B59-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Different results were obtained within the species tested. In bull, this plant has been used in the semen cryopreservation process. The extract was added to the sperm freezing medium. Several extract concentrations were employed ranging from 2 to 20 mL/dL. After semen thawing, several sperm parameters (motility, viability, and membrane integrity) were enhanced by the action of this plant. There was also a reduction in the MDA content and increased activity of SOD and CAT in the sperm samples. However, the highest concentrations (16 and 20 mL/dL) exerted negative effects on some sperm parameters. The most suitable concentrations for cryopreserved bull semen were 2 and 4 mL/dL. During incubation (5 and 10 min) of human semen samples, this plant extract (1.5 µL of oil extract in around 500 µL of diluted sperm) exerts positive effects on several sperm velocity parameters such as curvilinear velocity (VCL), straight-line velocity (VSL), average path velocity (VAP), and amplitude of lateral head displacement (ALH). Furthermore, after 10 min of semen incubation, this extract showed a protective effect on sperm DNA integrity. In rabbit, this plant extract was tested during fresh semen incubation at room temperature. While the lowest concentrations used (37.5 and 75 µg/mL) did not have positive or negative results on any of the sperm parameters evaluated, the highest concentrations (150 and 300 µg/mL) were detrimental for sperm function.
