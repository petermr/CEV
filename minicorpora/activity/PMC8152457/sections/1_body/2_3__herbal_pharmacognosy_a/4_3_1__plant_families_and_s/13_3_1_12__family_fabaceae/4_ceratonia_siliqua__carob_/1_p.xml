<p>This plant extract has been employed in human spermatozoa [
 <xref rid="B54-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] by adding it to the freezing and thawing medium. The range of concentrations used was from 5 to 30 µg/mL. The addition of this plant to the semen extender significantly increased sperm progressive motility, normal morphology, and viability together with a reduction in DNA damage. However, some of the concentrations employed had deleterious effects on sperm parameters. The best results were obtained with a concentration of 10 and 20 µg/mL.
