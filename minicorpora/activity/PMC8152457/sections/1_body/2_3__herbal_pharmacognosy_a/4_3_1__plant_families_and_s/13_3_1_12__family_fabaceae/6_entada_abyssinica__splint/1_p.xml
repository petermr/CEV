<p>This plant has been used as an extender additive for ram semen cryopreservation [
 <xref rid="B56-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. A wide set of concentrations was used (125, 250, 375, and 500 µg/mL). After semen thawing, this plant extract exerted positive effects on several sperm parameters (motility, viability, and membrane integrity) as well as a reduction in the concentration of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> of treated samples compared with the untreated samples. The most suitable concentration was 375 µg/mL. On the other hand, the extract concentration of 500 µg/mL had a negative effect on sperm viability.
