<p>The effects of 
 <italic>A. harveyi</italic> have been tested in bull sperm [
 <xref rid="B52-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] by adding the extract to the semen extender prior the cryopreservation process. After semen thawing, a significant reduction in the MDA content and an increase in TAC were observed in the samples treated with this plant. Furthermore, the extract exerted protective effects on sperm membrane and DNA integrity, motility, and viability and reduced the percentage of sperm abnormalities. A reduction in the percentage of apoptotic sperm and ultra-structure damage was also observed. The suitable range of concentrations to be used on bull sperm is within 0.5–1.5 µg/mL.
