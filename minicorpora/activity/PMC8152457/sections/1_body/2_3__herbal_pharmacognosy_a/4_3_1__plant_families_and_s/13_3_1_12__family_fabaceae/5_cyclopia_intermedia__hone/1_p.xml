<p>Honeybush has been tested as an alternative additive for boar semen preservation for 5 days at 17 °C [
 <xref rid="B55-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In general, this plant extract was able to improve the preservative properties of a long-term semen extender. The positive results on sperm parameters were observed from 48 to 120 h of semen storage. An extract concentration of 12.5 µg/mL in semen samples simultaneously preserved sperm motility, kinetics, acrosome integrity, and mitochondrial activity at 120 h of semen storage. None of the concentrations used (12.5, 25, 50, and 200 µg/mL) were detrimental for sperm function.
