<p>This plant has been used in boar semen samples stored for 96 h at 17 °C [
 <xref rid="B53-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Two types of rooibos (fermented and unfermented) were used. The range of extract concentrations employed was from 20 to 500 µg/mL. Even though the unfermented form had higher antioxidant capacity and total phenolic content than the fermented type, the latter showed the best effects on sperm function. During semen storage, this plant extract preserved sperm velocity, motility, and plasma membrane and acrosome integrity. The highest concentrations used significantly decreased total sperm motility without compromising acrosome and membrane integrity. The most suitable concentrations for boar semen were 20 and 60 µg/mL.
