 <xref rid="B71-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] semen. In buffalo, the semen extender was supplemented with a range of concentrations from 2.5% to 10%. Even though the best results were obtained with a 10% concentration of juice, all the tested extract concentrations enhanced several sperm parameters, such as motility, velocity, normal morphology and integrity of plasmalemma, acrosome, and DNA. Furthermore, under in vivo fertility trials, the use of semen samples supplemented with a 10% concentration of this plant extract led to higher pregnancy rates when compared with the control group. In bull, pomegranate extract has been added to the semen extender for sperm cryopreservation. A range of concentrations from 10% to 50% was used. There was an improvement in sperm motility and viability after semen thawing with the use of the lowest extract concentrations (10% and 20%). By contrast, the highest concentrations showed deleterious effects on sperm parameters. After ram semen thawing, several sperm parameters (motility, membrane integrity, viability, and mitochondrial activity) were enhanced by the use of this plant at a concentration of 5 mg/L. At the same concentration, there was also a reduction in MDA levels and an increased TAC in the semen samples. However, several sperm parameters were negatively affected at the highest concentration used (7.5 mg/L).
