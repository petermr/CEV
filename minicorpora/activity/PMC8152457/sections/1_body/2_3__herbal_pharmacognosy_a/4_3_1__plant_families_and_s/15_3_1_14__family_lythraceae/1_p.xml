<p>This is a group that is widely distributed but predominately found in tropical areas and less so in temperate regions. Plants are annual or perennial, mostly herbs, sometimes shrubs, and rarely trees, with approximately 30 genera and 600 species. They include several dye plants, such as 
 <italic>Lawsonia inermis</italic> (henna), and fruit trees (e.g., 
 <italic>Punica granatum</italic>; pomegranate). Members of 
 <italic>Cuphea</italic> have been identified as a good source of medium-chain triglycerides, while other genera provide good-quality timber (e.g., 
 <italic>Physocalymma scaberrimum</italic>).
