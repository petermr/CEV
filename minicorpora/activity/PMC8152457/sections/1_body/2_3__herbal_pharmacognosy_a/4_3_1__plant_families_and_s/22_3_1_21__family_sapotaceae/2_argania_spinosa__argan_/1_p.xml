 <italic>A. spinosa</italic> has been employed as an additive in ram semen [
 <xref rid="B86-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] during liquid storage at 5 °C and 15 °C during 48 h. The range of concentrations employed was from 1% to 10% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>). Argan oil improved several sperm parameters, such as viability, progressive motility, and membrane integrity, and reduced lipid peroxidation levels (MDA) and DNA fragmentation index. Nevertheless, some concentrations used were detrimental for membrane integrity at different storage times. The best results on sperm parameters were obtained with concentrations from 1% to 5%.
