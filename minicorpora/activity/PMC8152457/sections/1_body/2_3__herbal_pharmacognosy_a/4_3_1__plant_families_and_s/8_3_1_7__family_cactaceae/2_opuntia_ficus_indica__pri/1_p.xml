<p>Essential oil of this plant has been used as a supplement in tris egg yolk- and skim milk-based extenders during liquid storage (5 Â°C) of ram semen for 72 h [
 <xref rid="B46-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The extract showed positive effects on sperm motility, viability, and morphology and reduced lipid peroxidation and DNA fragmentation during semen storage. For both extenders, the optimal concentrations were 1% and 2%. The use of acetone extract from cladodes of this plant, from the same species and under the same experimental conditions [
 <xref rid="B47-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], improved sperm parameters (motility, viability, membrane integrity, and morphology) and reduced lipid peroxidation and DNA fragmentation during semen storage. However, the highest concentrations used (e.g., 4% and 8%) exerted deleterious effects on some sperm parameters when compared with the control group. The most suitable extract concentration was 1%.
