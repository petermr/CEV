<p>The effects of this flowering plant have been tested in ram epididymal spermatozoa [
 <xref rid="B45-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] by adding its extract to the freezing extender. The range of extract concentrations was from 5 to 20 mg/L. After thawing, several sperm parameters were enhanced by this natural additive, such as motility, kinetics, acrosome integrity, and mitochondrial activity. Moreover, the extract reduced the MDA content in the sperm samples and the cleavage rate was higher in oocytes fertilized with spermatozoa treated with this plant. On the other hand, the sperm samples treated with this plant (10 and 20 mg/L) showed higher ratios of sperm chromatin dispersion. All the extract concentrations used exerted positive results in at least one of the assessed sperm parameters.
