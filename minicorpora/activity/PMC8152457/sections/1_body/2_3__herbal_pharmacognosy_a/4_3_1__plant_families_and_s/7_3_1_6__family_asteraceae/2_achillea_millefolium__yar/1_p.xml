<p>This plant extract has been used as an additive in the rooster semen freezing extender both as a loaded nano-phytosome and as an extract alone [
 <xref rid="B44-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The range of extract concentrations employed was from 1.5 to 4.5 mg/L. After thawing, this plant extract improved several sperm parameters (i.e., motility, kinetics, and membrane integrity), reduced the MDA content, and increased the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and GPx activity. The best results were obtained at a concentration of 3 mg/L in nano-phytosome form directly included in the same extender.
