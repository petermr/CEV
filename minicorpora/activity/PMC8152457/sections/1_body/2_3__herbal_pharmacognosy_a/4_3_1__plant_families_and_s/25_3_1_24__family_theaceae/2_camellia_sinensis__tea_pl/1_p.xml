 <xref rid="B94-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Moreover, both fermented (black) and unfermented (green and white) types have been used with satisfactory results. In boar, green tea extract has been employed for the cryopreservation of semen. In this study [
 <xref rid="B89-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>], Gale et al. found reduced sperm MDA levels in the presence of tea at a concentration of 5%, although other concentrations showed detrimental effects on sperm parameters. The range of concentrations used was from 2.5% to 10%. By contrast, other authors [

 <xref rid="B91-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>] using a range of concentrations from 0.01% to 0.2% found positive effects on several sperm parameters (viability, motility, and acrosome integrity) as well as in the in vitro maturation of oocytes. However, the highest extract concentrations employed had deleterious effects on some sperm parameters. In dog [
 <xref rid="B92-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>], green tea has been tested for long-term semen storage (four weeks at 5 Â°C). The supplementation of semen with extract concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 1 mg/mL increased sperm motility and viability during the storage period. White and green tea have been tested on mouse epididymal spermatozoa [
 <xref rid="B93-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>] stored at room temperature for 72 h. Both extracts enhanced several sperm parameters during the incubation period. Two extract concentrations were used (0.5 and 1 mg/mL). The samples treated with this plant showed higher antioxidant potential and sperm viability together with a reduction in the MDA levels when compared with the control group. The white type showed better results in all the parameters evaluated, with the concentration of 1 mg/mL being the most suitable. Green tea has been also employed for the cryopreservation of ram semen [
 <xref rid="B94-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>] by adding to the semen extender three extract concentrations (5, 10, and 15 mg/L). This plant extract exerted positive effects on sperm viability, motility, plasma membrane integrity, and mitochondrial activity. Moreover, the samples treated with this plant showed higher antioxidant capacity and lower levels of MDA than the control group. However, the highest concentrations used promoted an increase in the MDA levels (15 mg/L) and a decrease in the activity of GPx (10 mg/L) in the semen samples. The best results were obtained with an extract concentration of 10 mg/L.
