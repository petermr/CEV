<p>This plant has been used in chilled (5 Â°C for 6 days) and cryopreserved bull sperm [
 <xref rid="B88-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. The extract concentration in the semen extender ranged from 0.25 to 7.5 mg/mL. For both processes, the extract exerted positive effects on sperm motility, viability, and membrane integrity. Additionally, in the chilled samples, there was a reduction in the percentage of sperm with abnormal morphology. After semen thawing, there was also a reduction in the MDA levels and DNA damage in the samples treated with this plant. In the chilled samples, the best results were obtained with extract concentrations of 0.25 and 1 mg/mL, while in the frozen samples, a concentration of 5 mg/mL was the most suitable. However, the highest concentrations employed exerted deleterious effects on some sperm parameters.
