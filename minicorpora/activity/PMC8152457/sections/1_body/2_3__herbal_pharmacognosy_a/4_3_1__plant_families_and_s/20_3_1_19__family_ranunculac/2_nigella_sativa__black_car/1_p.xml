<p>Seminal doses from goat [

 <xref rid="B84-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] were treated with this plant. In goat, this extract was tested both in fresh and cryopreserved semen at a concentration of 0.5%. In fresh semen, 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> had negative effects on sperm motility after 1.5 and 2 h of sperm collection, while progressive motility and sperm abnormalities were not significantly different from the control group. In the cryopreserved samples, there were neither positive nor negative effects on sperm function. In ram, this plant was added to the semen extender before sperm cryopreservation. The extract concentrations employed ranged from 10 to 1000 µg/mL. Immediately after semen thawing and at 2 h of post-thaw incubation, there were enhancements in several sperm parameters, such as motility, kinetics, and acrosome and DNA integrity. The most suitable concentration for the cryopreservation of ram semen was 100 µg/mL. However, the highest extract concentration had deleterious effects on some sperm parameters.
