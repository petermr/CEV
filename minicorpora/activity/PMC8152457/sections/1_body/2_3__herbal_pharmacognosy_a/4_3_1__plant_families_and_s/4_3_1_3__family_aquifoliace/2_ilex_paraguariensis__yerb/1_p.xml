<p>This plant extract has been used as an additive in the cryopreservation process of boar epididymal sperm [
 <xref rid="B39-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The tested concentrations ranged from 2.5 to 10 g/L. Within all the sperm parameters assessed after thawing, the mate tea reduced lipid peroxidation (MDA levels) and protected DNA against oxidative damage. The best results were obtained by using an extract concentration of 10 g/L in the extender.
