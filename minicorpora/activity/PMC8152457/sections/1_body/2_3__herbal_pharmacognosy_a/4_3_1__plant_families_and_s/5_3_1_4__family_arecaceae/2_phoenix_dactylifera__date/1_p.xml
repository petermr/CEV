<p>Pollen from this palm has been used as an additive during chilling (buffalo and bull sperm) and cryopreservation (buffalo and stallion sperm). The extract was added to semen extenders with or without egg yolk. After 7 days of buffalo semen chilling and after semen thawing [
 <xref rid="B40-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], the authors observed significant improvements in sperm motility, viability, and membrane integrity. The best results were obtained using a set of concentrations ranging from 10 to 50 mg/mL. However, some treatments showed deleterious effects on sperm function. Similarly, after stallion semen thawing [
 <xref rid="B41-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], date palm extract exerted a protective effect on sperm motility and acrosome and membrane integrity at a range of concentrations from 20 to 30 mg/mL. On the other hand, some extract concentrations had negative effects on several sperm parameters. Moreover, the addition of this plant extract on bull semen [
 <xref rid="B42-antioxidants-10-00772" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] (both refrigerated at 5 Â°C and cryopreserved) exerted positive effects on sperm motility, viability, and plasma membrane integrity. Additionally, in the cryopreserved samples treated with this plant, there was a higher percentage of sperm with an intact acrosome and normal morphology than in the control group. The extract concentration employed was 0.4 mg/mL.
