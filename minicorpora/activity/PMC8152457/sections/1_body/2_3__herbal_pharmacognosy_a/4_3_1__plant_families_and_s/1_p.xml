<p>Tens of plant species (extracts) have been used as preservatives for semen storage in several animal species, including humans. The extracts are usually added to the semen extender and used both for sperm refrigeration and cryopreservation. These compounds can be incorporated into the diluents during all the steps involved in the sperm cryopreservation process (i.e., pre-freezing cooling/equilibration, and post-thawing incubation). Overall, sperm parameters and fertilization ability can be improved by the action of these natural compounds; in addition, some plant species can exert protection against pathogenic bacteria and act as ROS scavengers. In this section, a detailed description of the effects of 45 plant species on sperm function in several animal species is presented (
