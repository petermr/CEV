<p>Irrespective of the extender and the storage conditions used, semen handling and preservation negatively affect sperm quality. Despite being a necessary step to increase sperm lifespan and the number of AI doses, semen dilution decreases the levels of antioxidant enzymes found in the seminal plasma, thus reducing their protection against oxidative stress. Seminal plasma contains several antioxidant enzymes; superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) are those with the greatest activity [
