<p>The semen cryopreservation process alters the cellular and molecular structure of spermatozoa. Several factors, such as semen handling, cold shock, osmotic and toxic stresses induced by cryoprotectants, and the formation/reshaping of extra- and intracellular ice during freezing and thawing, contribute to the poor sperm quality observed after semen thawing. All of these factors promote a decrease in sperm motility, viability, and mitochondrial membrane potential together with plasma membrane disruption, volumetric changes, and sperm flagellum alterations [
