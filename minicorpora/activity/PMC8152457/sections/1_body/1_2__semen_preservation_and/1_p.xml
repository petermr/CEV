<p>Artificial insemination is usually carried out with semen stored in a liquid or frozen state. The cryopreserved semen is commonly employed in the AI of domestic and wild animals. However, in species such as pigs, goats, and horses, the most common way to preserve the sperm cells is by refrigeration at 5–17 °C for several days. In general, there are two types of semen extenders for sperm liquid storage: short- and long-term extenders. The first one is intended for semen preservation for up to three days, while the long-term type is able to preserve the sperm cells for more than three days thanks to the supplementation with additives, which significantly increase the price of the extender. The composition of semen extenders varies considerably depending on the species and type of sperm preservation (i.e., cryopreserved or refrigerated). In general, the semen extender contains nutrients (mainly monosaccharides), cryoprotectant agents (CPAs) as protection against cold shock, buffers, antioxidants, and antibiotics [

There are two types of CPAs: permeable and non-permeable. Among the most popular permeable CPAs are glycerol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and ethylene glycol (EG), whereas for non-permeable CPAs, proteins found in egg yolk and milk as well as sugars are preferred [

Due to the possible overproduction of ROS during semen preservation, the addition of antioxidant compounds to the semen extender is common. For sperm cryopreservation, antioxidants can be added to the extender before freezing or after semen thawing. With the use of antioxidants, the amount of ROS produced by semen handling and the cryopreservation process is considerably reduced. Among the most common antioxidants employed for sperm freezing are vitamin E (α-tocopherol/Trolox), glutathione (GSH), SOD, catalase (CAT), vitamin C (ascorbic acid), quercetin, and melatonin [
