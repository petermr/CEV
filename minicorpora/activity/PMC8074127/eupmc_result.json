    "Essential oils (EOs) and extracts of rose geranium (<i>Pelargonium graveolens</i>) and petals of rose (<i>Rosa damascena</i>) have been fully characterized in terms of composition, safety, antimicrobial, and antiviral properties. They were analyzed against <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Aspergillus niger</i>, and Adenovirus 35. Their toxicity and life span were also determined. EO of <i>P. graveolens</i> (5%) did not retain any antibacterial activity (whereas at 100% it was greatly effective against <i>E. coli</i>), had antifungal activity against <i>A. niger</i>, and significant antiviral activity. Rose geranium extract (dilutions 25-90%) (<i>v</i>/<i>v</i>) had antifungal and antibacterial activity, especially against <i>E. coli</i>, and dose-dependent antiviral activity. Rose petals EO (5%) retains low inhibitory activity against <i>S. aureus</i> and <i>S.</i> Typhimurium growth (about 20-30%), antifungal activity, and antiviral activity for medium to low virus concentrations. Rose petals extract had significant antibacterial activity at dilutions of 25-90%, especially against <i>E. coli</i> and <i>S.</i> Typhimurium, antifungal, and the most potent antiviral activity. None of the EOs and extracts were toxic in dilutions of up to 5% and 90%, respectively. Finally, all materials had a life span of more than eight weeks. These results support the aspect that rose petals and rose geranium EOs, and extracts, have beneficial antimicrobial and antiviral properties and they can be used as natural preservatives."
