<p>The purpose of this study was to fully characterize the chemical composition of EOs and extracts from rose petals and rose geranium, and test their efficacy against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, S. typhimurium, 
 <italic>A. niger</italic>, and Adenovirus 35 in different concentrations. Their toxicity levels were determined, to be used as food preservatives without causing toxicity problems in the human body. Finally, their life span was determined to establish implementation of EO and extract constituents as natural food preservatives.
