<p>Experimental data show that all EOs in the concentrations of 100% and 50% were particularly effective against the fungus. At the end of the third day, the fungus stabilizes almost in diameter in all the oils and stops growing, while in the control it grows until it occupies the whole petri dish, which is why in the last days of the experiment its growth rate is low. As the days go by, the growth rate reaches saturation. The reason this happens is because natural preservatives contain nutrients that initially favor the growth of the fungus. Nevertheless, this particular resistance can disappear [
