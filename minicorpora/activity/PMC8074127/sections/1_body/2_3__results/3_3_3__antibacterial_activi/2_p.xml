 <italic>P. graveolens’</italic> essential oil showed a significant antibacterial activity (85%) against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> in 100% concentration. In lower concentrations, it did not affect 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> growth. On the other hand, the extract showed good antibacterial activity (68%) against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> in 90% concentration and average efficacy in 50% and 25% concentrations (59% and 46% respectively). As for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, the essential oil had good antibacterial activity (55%) in 100% concentration. In lower concentrations, it was not effective. The extract was not effective against this bacterium—only in 90% concentration it appeared to have a minor inhibition (40%). Finally, the essential oil had a small activity against 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp. (51%), in 100% concentration. In lower concentrations, its activity was negligible. The extract was almost efficient in 90%, 42%, while in lower concentrations, it had no effect.
