 <italic>z</italic> 100−1000. Nitrogen was applied as gas for ionization. Separation was performed on a Poroshell 120 EC 18 column (4.6 × 100 mm, 2.7 μm) (Agilent Technologies Inc.). LC conditions were as follows: solvent A (0.1% formic acid) and solvent B (acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid). A gradient elution was used as follows: 0−5 min 4% B; 5−15 min 4−15% B; 15−18 min 15% B; 18−23 min 15−20% B; 23−33 min 20% B; 33−48 min 20−58% B; 48−63 min 58% B; 63−75 min 58−95% B; 75−80 min 95% B; 80−84 min 95−4% B; 84−88 min 4% B. Flow rate was 0.5 mL/min and the injection volume was 20 μL.
