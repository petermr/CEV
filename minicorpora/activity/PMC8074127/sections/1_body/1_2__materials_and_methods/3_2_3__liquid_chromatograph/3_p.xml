<p>The standards that were used for identification were rutin (HPLC &gt; 99%) from Extrasynthese (Genay, France), quercetin 3-O-glucoside (HPLC &gt; 98%) from Extrasynthese (Genay, Gedex), and kaempferol (HPLC &gt; 96%) from Sigma Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany). The identification of the other compounds was based on comparison of their retention time and their mass spectra to the literature. The quantification analysis of the compounds was based on the rutin standard curve (3.125−100.000 μg/mL, y = 29361x + 425743, R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9632). The Lower Limit of Quantitation (LLOQ) was 3.125 μg/mL since it is the lowest concentration of rutin giving an acceptable accuracy (relative error &lt;20%) and the Lower Limit of Detection (LLOD) was 0.875 μg/mL calculated as a signal to noise ratio of 3.
