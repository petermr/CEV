<p>After 
 <italic>A. niger</italic> was developed on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA), the fungal cultures were replaced on PDA that contained 5 μL of different dilutions of the EOs (1, ½, ¼ dilutions) and the extracts (1/1.1, ½, ¼ dilutions). The plates were incubated at 22 °C for 7 days. Then, a daily monitoring of the diameter of each colony occurred and the results were recorded and compared with the Control. All experiments were performed in triplicate at each concentration. In the evaluation of the antifungal activity, the percentage inhibition was calculated.
