<p>Then solutions containing serial concentrations of AdV (30 µL) and the sample (30 µL) were added and incubated with stirring (150 rpm) for 90 min at 37 °C. The medium was discarded and DMEM was re-added with 1% FBS. The 12-well plates were incubated for 3−4 days at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Subsequently, the cytotoxicity was observed by electron microscope. Tests were performed according to Saderi et al., 2011 [
 <xref rid="B28-pathogens-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], claiming that the concentrations of the samples that entirely suspend AdV35 cytopathic effect, is recorded as efficient concentration, comparing to virus control. All experiments were performed in duplicate at each concentration.
