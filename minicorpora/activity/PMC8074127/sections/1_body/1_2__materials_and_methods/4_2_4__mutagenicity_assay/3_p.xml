<p>Τhe test was performed by the pre-incubation method [
 <xref rid="B23-pathogens-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. From each colony cultivated overnight, 0.1 mL is taken and mixed with 0.1 mL of the potential mutant at various concentrations. For the EOs, the concentrations were up to 5%, while for the extracts up to 90%, since these are the usual upper limits of their presence in foods and drinks. Then, 2 mL Top Agar with 10% sterile 0.5 mM L-histidine HCl, 0.5 mM biotin solution were added. The contents of each tube were poured into a sterile multi-channel reagent container and 200 µL of dilutions were distributed to each of the 24-well plates, using a multi-channel pipette. After incubation at 37 °C for 48 h, toxicity was determined. The samples were placed in closed bags, as it is proposed for testing highly volatile chemicals and gases [

A color change from purple to yellow signifies mutagenicity. All experiments were performed in triplicate at each concentration.
