<p>The Salmonella tester strains were TA98 and TA100. TA98 causes frameshifts [
 <xref rid="B25-pathogens-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], while TA100 provokes base-pair substitution [
 <xref rid="B26-pathogens-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The lyophilized strains (2.5 μL) were transferred to Growth Media containing 5 mL, 0.01 mL of Express Reagent ‘V’, (different vial for each strain). Then, they were incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. The next day, the bacterial growth was checked for turbidity. The experimental procedure was continued only if there was turbidity [
