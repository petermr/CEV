<p>After placing 5 μL of different dilutions of the EOs (1, ½, ¼) and the extracts (90%, 50%, 25%) on Brain Heart Infusion Agar (BHI) plates, plates were dried at room temperature. Then, 1 μL of the bacterial strain (10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL), in serial dilutions, was spread to the plates. Plates were left to dry at room temperature for 30 min, before the incubation. The incubation was implemented at 37 °C for 24 h. After incubation, there was a record of the presence or absence of microorganisms and a comparison with Control. All experiments were performed in triplicate at each concentration.
