<p>All samples were analyzed using an Agilent Technologies 6890N equipped with a 5975B mass selective detector (MSD) in the electron impact (EI) mode of 70 eV. The capillary column was HP-5MS (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm) with helium as a carrier gas. Data analysis was performed with GC/MSD Chemstation (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) and Mestre Nova v.6.0.2-5475 (Mestrelab Research S.L., Santiago de Compostela, Spain).</p>
