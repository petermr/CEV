<p>All samples were diluted (1:40 for rose petals EO and 1:30 for geranium leaf EO) in ethyl acetate and the injection volume was 1 μL. n-Octane (98% purity) was used as an internal standard (final concentration 0.3 mg/mL). Alkanes (C8−C24) were analyzed under the same conditions and were used as reference points for the calculation of retention indices with the Van den Dool and Kratz equation [

 <xref rid="B22-pathogens-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and the literature. Results were expressed as the percentage of the ratio of each compound peak area to that of the internal standard, using the program WSEARCH32 (Ver. 16/2005). Only compounds with peak area higher than 0.1% are presented.
