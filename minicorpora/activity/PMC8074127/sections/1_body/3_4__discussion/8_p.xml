<p>The major component of the extract of rose petals is kaempferol-3-O-glucoside, alongside with other kaempferol glycosides, and it has been shown to have antimicrobial and antioxidant effects [

 <xref rid="B67-pathogens-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,
 <xref rid="B68-pathogens-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. The rose geranium extract, also rich in flavonoids (quercetin glycosides), had strong antimicrobial and antiviral activity in our study; our results are in agreement with earlier reports on the antimicrobial activity of geranium extracts [

 <xref rid="B69-pathogens-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] and quercetin derivatives [
 <xref rid="B66-pathogens-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The antiviral properties of quercetin and kaempferol derivatives have been reported in numerous publications [
 <xref rid="B70-pathogens-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], e.g., against influenza viruses [

 <xref rid="B72-pathogens-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], coronaviruses, and dengue viruses [

 <xref rid="B74-pathogens-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], and in particular of quercetin against adenoviruses 1 and 3 [
 <xref rid="B75-pathogens-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]; the reports indicate that those flavonols block viral entry to the host cell via specific interactions with viral attachment factors and/or membrane fusion proteins, suppress signaling pathways that are essential for virus gene expression, inhibit remodeling enzymes and channels (which regulate viral movement (e.g., neuraminidase)), and inhibit transcription of the viral genome and viral protein synthesis [
 <xref rid="B70-pathogens-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. However, none of the previous studies have addressed the issue of their realistic application in foods and drinks as natural preservatives, since a final product will contain these EOs and extracts in a certain percentage, due to the organoleptic properties they confer, e.g., the strong odour.
