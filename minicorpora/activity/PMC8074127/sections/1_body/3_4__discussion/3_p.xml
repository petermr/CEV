<p>In the essential oil of rose petals, thirteen compounds were identified, representing 96.47 ± 0.43% of the total oil (
 <xref rid="pathogens-10-00494-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In our study, the main components of the essential oil were identified as phenyl ethyl alcohol (40.2%) and geraniol (27.8%). The remaining detected compounds were less than 20%. In accordance with our results, Verma et al. showed that phenyl ethyl alcohol was the main component in 
 <italic>R. damascena</italic> EO of Ranisahiba cultivar (76%), and of Noorjahan and Kannouj cultivars (80.7 and 76.7%, respectively) at full bloom stage [

 <italic>R. damascena</italic> and 
 <italic>R. moschata</italic> var. nastarana flowers by headspace extraction, phenyl ethyl ethanol was the dominant ingredient albeit in different amounts [

 <xref rid="B47-pathogens-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] on damask roses from Turkey, phenyl ethyl alcohol was the major component in EO from fresh rose petals (25.06%), and that amount significantly increased when the plant material was stored before distillation [
 <xref rid="B47-pathogens-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The relationship of the chemical composition with the climate has also been suggested; according to Misra et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-pathogens-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], geraniol content decreases whereas phenyl ethyl alcohol increases in colder climates and at higher altitude [
 <xref rid="B48-pathogens-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Accordingly, in our study, rose petals were harvested in late spring from a mountainous location (360 m altitude) at a Northern Aegean island, which enjoys mild Mediterranean climate; in late spring the mean temperature does not exceed 20 °C. Therefore, differences in the rose petal EO composition can be attributed to several factors like the genotype, the cultivation, and the storage conditions.
