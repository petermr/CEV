<p>The analysis of rose petals’ extract showed eighteen identified components. The main component of the herbal extract was kaempferol-3-O-glucoside (55.4%). The remaining detected components were less than 12%. Compounds were mainly identified as quercetin glycosides and kaempferol derivatives by comparison of their retention time with the standards and the literature data [

 <xref rid="B53-pathogens-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. As can be seen from 
 <xref rid="pathogens-10-00494-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the kaempferol glycosides accounted for the largest percentage of the compounds that were quantified, with kaempferol-3-O-glucoside being the predominant component. This is in accordance with other studies that report that kaempferol-3-O-glucoside is the main component in rose petals of 
 <italic>R. damascena</italic> [
 <xref rid="B51-pathogens-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], and in rose petals of Taif rose [
 <xref rid="B53-pathogens-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In this study, nine kaempferol derivatives were identified. Most of them have also been reported in other species of the Rosacae family [

 <xref rid="B53-pathogens-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Kaempferol deoxyhexoside and kaempferol acetyldisaccharide were previously identified in extracts of 
 <italic>R. damascena</italic> from Bulgaria [
 <xref rid="B51-pathogens-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Compounds 1 and 2 have also been determined from 
 <italic>R. damascena</italic> from Egypt [
 <xref rid="B54-pathogens-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], and the hybrid “Jardin de Granville” from France [
 <xref rid="B50-pathogens-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], respectively. Five quercetin derivatives were identified in this study. Compounds 4 and 8 were also detected in 
 <italic>R. damascena</italic> from Bulgaria [
 <xref rid="B52-pathogens-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and from India [
 <xref rid="B48-pathogens-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The presence of quercetin glycosides and kaempferol aglycone has been reported also in other species of the Rosacae family, in addition to 
 <italic>R. damascena</italic>, such as 
 <italic>Rosa bourboniana</italic> Desport., 
 <italic>Rosa brunonii</italic> Lindl., known as ‘Himalayan musk rose [
 <xref rid="B49-pathogens-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], the hybrid “Jardin de Granville” [
 <xref rid="B50-pathogens-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], and Taif rose, Ward Taifi (
 <italic>R. damascena trigintipetala</italic> Dieck) [
 <xref rid="B53-pathogens-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].
