<p>A variability in the percentages of the main ingredients has been recorded. In a survey conducted in Greece and especially in the island of Crete, the two main components, citronellol and geraniol, were determined at percentages of over 25% and about 20%, respectively [

Accordingly, Verma et al. showed that the composition of the essential oil depends on the duration of cultivation; in that study, geraniol content was at its maximum in the crop transplanted in the month of April and citronellol content was higher in that transplanted in February, whereas all plants were harvested in June [

 <xref rid="B44-pathogens-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] showed that the citronellol and the geraniol content was affected by planting location and harvest time. That work was carried out during the two successive seasons (2012/2013 and 2013/2014) to investigate the effect of different planting locations (5 different locations in Egypt) on quantity and quality of 
 <italic>P. graveolens</italic> volatile oil. In most locations, the highest citronellol content was obtained in spring cut, while the lowest was obtained in autumn cut [
