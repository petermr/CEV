<p>Our results are in line with previous studies demonstrating that rose oil and its aqueous extracts have moderate broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity [

 <xref rid="B59-pathogens-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Phenyl ethyl alcohol, the main rose oil constituent (40%) in our study, has been attributed antimicrobial properties for a long time but their inhibitory actions are considered complex and generally seem to be dominated by their physicochemical properties [

 <xref rid="B61-pathogens-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. A recent study by Guimaraes et al. (2019) [
 <xref rid="B62-pathogens-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], showed that geraniol and citronellol (the major rose geranium EO constituent and a major rose oil one) are fast-acting compounds that inactivate 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium by inducing loss of cellular membrane integrity or function. Thus, the antimicrobial activity of rose geranium oil demonstrated is our study is explained by, and is in agreement to, previous reports [

 <xref rid="B64-pathogens-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Concerning their antiviral activities, limited information is available about rose geranium oil, and no information is available, as far as we know, for citronellol, geraniol, and phenyl ethyl alcohol [
