<p>Most of the compounds were flavonol glycosides, i.e., quercetin and kaempferol derivatives. Compounds 1â€“9 were previously reported in a study on 
 <italic>P. graveolens</italic> [
 <xref rid="B55-pathogens-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Compounds 2, 6, and 7 have been reported in other species of the Geraniacae family, except from geranium, i.e., 
 <italic>Geranium molle</italic> L. [
 <xref rid="B56-pathogens-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and 
 <italic>Geranium robertianum</italic> L. [
 <xref rid="B57-pathogens-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Finally, to the best of our knowledge compounds 10, 11 have not been reported in Geraniacae family. Our results show that the quercetin glycosides accounted for the largest percentage of the compounds that were quantified, with quercetin-3-O-glucoside being the main component.
