<p>The screening activity of TS Oil was performed by the agar well diffusion method. A suspension of tested microbes equivalent to 0.5 McFarland was cultivated in Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA, Scharlau). TS Oil (50 µL) and 1% DMSO as control were added in each well, and the plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h and zones of inhibitions were measured.</p>
