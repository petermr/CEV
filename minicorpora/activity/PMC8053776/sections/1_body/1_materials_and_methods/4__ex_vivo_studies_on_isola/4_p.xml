<p>Usually, plant materials that produce tracheal relaxation also show inhibitory actions on the PDE-enzyme, hence the method described by (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Gilani et al., 2005</xref>) was followed to assess the presence of possible PDE inhibitory effects in our plant essential oil. Briefly, inhibitory CRCs of isoprenaline were constructed against CCh-induced contractions in the absence (control) and in the presence of TS Oil.
