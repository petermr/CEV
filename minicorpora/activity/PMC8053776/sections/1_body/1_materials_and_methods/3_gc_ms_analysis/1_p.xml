<p>The extracted oil of 
 <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> was analyzed by the Perkin Elmer gas chromatograph (Clarus 600) coupled with a Perkin Elmer (Clarus 600 T) mass selective detector. Subsequently, 1 µL of the aliquots of the extracts were injected into Elite 5-MS capillary column (30m × 250 µm I. D, 0.25 µm film thickness; Perkin Elmer, Shelton, CT, United States) in the splitless mode of 1:20. The column temperature was kept at 40°C during sample injection and was raised to 150°C for 2 min having rate of 10°C/min and further increased to 300°C held for 2 min. The injector temperature was at 280°C, inlet line temperature at 220°C, and source temperature was 220°C. The total run time was 32 min. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 ml per min. Detection was carried out by using MS detection in electron-ionization mode using a single quadrupole detector and full-scan monitoring mode (m/z 40–600).
