  <italic>Lannea egregia</italic> (Anacardiaceae) and 
  <italic>Emilia sonchifolia</italic> (Asteraceae) are plants used in traditional medicine in southwestern Nigeria. The essential oils from the leaves of 
  <italic>L. egregia</italic> and 
  <italic>E. sonchifolia</italic> were obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Both essential oils were dominated by sesquiterpenoids. The major components in 
  <italic>L. egregia</italic> leaf essential oil were α-panasinsen (34.90%), (
  <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene (12.25%), α-copaene (11.39%), and selina-4,11-diene (9.29%), while 
  <italic>E. sonchifolia</italic> essential oil was rich in γ-himachalene (25.16%), (
  <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene (15.72%), and γ-gurjunene (8.58%). The essential oils were screened for antimicrobial activity against a panel of bacteria and fungi and displayed minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 156 μg/mL to 625 μg/mL. Based on these results, either 
  <italic>L. egregia</italic> or 
  <italic>E. sonchifolia</italic> essential oil may be recommended for exploration as complementary antibacterial or antifungal agents.
