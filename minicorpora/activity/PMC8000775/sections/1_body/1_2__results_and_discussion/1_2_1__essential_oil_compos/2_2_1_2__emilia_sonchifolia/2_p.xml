<p>The essential oil of the aerial parts of 
 <italic>E. sonchifolia</italic> from Belagavi, Karnataka, India, has been reported [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-10-00488" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The essential oil from India was also dominated by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (67.6%), but with a remarkably different composition. The major components in the essential oil from India were γ-muurolene (32.1%) and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene (22.7%). γ-Muurolene was not observed in the essential oil from Nigeria, while γ-himachalene, γ-gurjunene, and germacrene D were not reported in the essential oil from India. Both caryophyllene oxide and palmitic acid were found in the essential oil from India (1.1% and 1.2%, respectively). Apparently, the geographical separation of these two samples has a profound effect on the phytochemistry.
