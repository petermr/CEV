    "The aim of this study was to detect effects of bitter orange (<i>Citrus aurantium</i>) essential oil, commonly called neroli oil (NO) (0, 0.25, 0.50, 1, and 1.5% referred to as NO<sub>0</sub> NO<sub>0.25</sub>, NO<sub>0. 05</sub>, NO<sub>1</sub> and NO<sub>1.5</sub>, respectively) on growth performance output and expression levels of some growth-related genes in the muscle tissue and some immune-related genes in the head kidney and pathological differences in digestive system organs of common carp <i>Cyprinus carpio</i>. The NO<sub>0.25</sub> group had a large improvement in growth efficiency at the end of the 60-day feeding cycle. Real-time PCR (Bio RAD, USA) system was used to detect variations in gene expression levels. Furthermore, NO supplementation of up to 0.25% in muscle tissue controlled the release of growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). Furthermore, in the NO<sub>0.25</sub> treatment category, immune response gene levels TNF-α, IL-8 and IL-1ß increased in head kidney tissue. In the histological examination of the liver and intestine, there were significant differences between fish fed with N<sub>1</sub> and N<sub>1.5</sub> diets. This study confirms that dietary supplementation of NO up to 0.25% can improve common carp growth efficiency and increase the expression of genes (GH and IGF-I) related to muscle growth, TNF-α, IL-8 and IL-1ß genes related to immune status, and liver and intestine histological status of common carp."
