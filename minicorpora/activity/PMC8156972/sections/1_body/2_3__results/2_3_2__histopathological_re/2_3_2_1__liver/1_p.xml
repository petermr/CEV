<p>Balloon-like and hydropic degeneration in hepatocytes, nuclear pycnosis, vacuolar degeneration, congestion in sinusoids and accumulation of fatty vocals and steatosis were evaluated histopathologically and scored semiquantitatively. Diffuse balloon-like and hydropic degeneration in hepatocytes was found to be more severe (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="animals-11-01431-f001">Figure 1</xref>A–C). Pycnosis in hepatocytes, and congestion in sinusoids and Kupffer cells were found in all experimental groups. In addition, no hyperplasia was found in the bile ducts.
