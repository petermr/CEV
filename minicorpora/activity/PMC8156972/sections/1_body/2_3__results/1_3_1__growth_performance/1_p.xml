 <xref rid="animals-11-01431-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> shows the effects of NO on the growth performance of common carp (
 <italic>C. carpio</italic>). In terms of growth performance, there was a large gap between the study groups at the end of the experiment. It was discovered that an improvement in NO in the ration diminished fish growth efficiency. The fish fed NO
 <sub>0.25</sub> had the highest growth efficiency, which was found to be statistically distinct from the control group.
