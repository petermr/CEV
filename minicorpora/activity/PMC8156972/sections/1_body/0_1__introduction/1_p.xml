<p>Regarding the advancement of intensive aquaculture systems, one of the most critical issues of aquaculture has been to protect the fish from diseases while harvesting the maximum amount of product per farm unit. Researchers believe that improving fish feed quality could be the most efficient approach to this issue, and there has been research into high performance feeds for a long time. As a consequence, several synthetic feed additives, especially antibiotics, have been applied to fish feeds to protect the feed quality, and protect fish from potential diseases and environmental problems [
