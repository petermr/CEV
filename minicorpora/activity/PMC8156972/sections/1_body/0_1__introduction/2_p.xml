 <xref rid="B11-animals-11-01431" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It has been determined that NO has several beneficial effects, especially in laboratory animals, due to the bioactive molecules it contains. NO was shown to have antianxiety effects in rats by regulating serotonin receptors, and an antidepressant effect in mice [
