<p>Intestinal anatomy represents fish wellbeing in terms of nutrient processing ability and immunological functions [

 <xref rid="B33-animals-11-01431" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] discovered that clove (
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic>), basil (
 <italic>O. gratissimum</italic> L.), and ginger essential oil (
 <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic>) had greater lymphocytic penetration in the intestine of fish fed 1.5% ginger essential oil, and that essential oils had harmful consequences at higher doses. The oils studied, on the other hand, have been shown to boost the immune system and reduce tissue harm induced by 
 <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic> infection. In the groups that used NO in the studyâ€™s histopathological analysis of the intestines, cell invasion and hyperemia were present in the lamina propria and submucosa. Cell infiltration in the lamina propria and submucosa was observed to be more serious in the groups that used higher doses of NO (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) relative to the groups that used low doses of NO. These histopathological changes in the intestines were thought to cause inflammation when large doses of NO were used, and they could be due to the toxicity or allergic disorder of such oil components.
