<p>The use of chemicals in diets as immunostimulants or growth promotors can be harmful to animals, consumers and the environment [
 <xref rid="B21-animals-11-01431" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. That is why research is focused on natural products to replace chemicals in fish feeds. For this purpose, this study aimed to determine the possibilities of using NO obtained from bitter orange (
 <italic>Citrus aurantium</italic>) in carp (
 <italic>Cyprinus carpio</italic>) diets and to determine its effects on growth performance, gene expression and liver and intestinal histology. The results indicate that dietary NO levels greater than 1% have a negative impact on carp development. Similarly, dose dependent effects of pomegranate seed (
 <italic>Punica granatum)</italic> EOs in rainbow trout diets were recorded, where 5% and 10% of pomegranate seed oils (
 <italic>P. granatum</italic>) in diets stimulated growth production while 20% significantly suppressed growth [

 <xref rid="B23-animals-11-01431" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] discovered that symbiotic bacteria in the intestine play an important role in digestion, and that an increase in the population of commensal bacteria can affect growth efficiency. It should be expected that utilizing NO up to 1% in fish diets would affect the microbial equilibrium in the digestive system and would have a negative effect on fish growth efficiency. These findings further highlight the significance of appropriate dosing in achieving the desired outcomes [
