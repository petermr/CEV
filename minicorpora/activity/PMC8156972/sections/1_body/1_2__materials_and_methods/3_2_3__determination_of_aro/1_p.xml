<p>The aromatic components of NO were measured using Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) after it was obtained from a nearby medicinal herb shop and diluted with NO high-purity ethanol at a ratio of 1/20. (Shimadzu GCMS QP 2010 ULTRA). By comparing the Wiley W9N11 spectra libraries, ion chromatograms were established. 
 <xref rid="animals-11-01431-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> indicates the derived phytochemicals, their proportional percentages in the NO, and their retention periods. The major compounds in NO were identified using GC. Linalyl acetate (42.77%) was the most prevalent chemical constituent, followed by linalool (27.41%) and geranly acetate (10.21%); limonene dioxide (3.50%) was also found.
