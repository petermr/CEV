<p>The fish were individually weighed at the start and end of the experiment. Fish growth performance was estimated using following equations:
 <disp-formula>Specific growth rate (SGR, %/day) = 100 (ln final fish weight) âˆ’ (ln initial fish weight)/experimental days
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula>
 <disp-formula>Feed conversion ratio (FCR) = feed fed/weight gain
  <label>(2)</label>
 </disp-formula>
