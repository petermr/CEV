<p>For the immune-related gene expression analysis, head kidney tissue, and for the growth-related gene expression analysis, muscle tissue, from five fish from each tank were dissected and deposited in RNAlater solution at −20 °C for complete RNA extraction. RNA was extracted from head kidney and muscle tissue samples using the GeneJet RNA purification kit (Thermo Science, Waltham, MA, USA). The samples were then placed in RNAlater solution (Thermo Scientific, USA). The quality of isolated RNA was assessed using a MultiskanTM FC Microplate Photometer (Thermo Scientific, USA).</p>
