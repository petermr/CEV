<p>The experimental analysis used 450 common carp collected from the Mediterranean Fisheries Research, Production, and Training Institute in Antalya, Turkey. The experimental fish were acclimatized in a 1000 L tank for 14 days and fed with commercial carp feed during acclimatization period. During the acclimatization and experimentation periods, the fish were held at ambient temperatures of 25 ± 1 °C, dissolved oxygen of 6.02 ± 0.78 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> and pH of 7.35 ± 0.68. In this experiment, 450 fish (1.94 ± 0.05 g) were randomly assigned to one of five groups (15 aquaria) and assigned the codes NO
 <sub>0</sub>, NO
 <sub>0.25</sub>, NO
 <sub>0.50</sub>, NO
 <sub>1</sub> and NO
 <sub>1.5</sub>. Each treatment was formed in triplicate. For 60 days, the fish were fed twice a day at 9:00 and 16:00
