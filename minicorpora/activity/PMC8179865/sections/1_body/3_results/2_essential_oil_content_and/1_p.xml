<p id="Par22">The essential oil content of two genotypes of 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> was not significantly affected by different LED light sources when compared to the greenhouse condition (in the range of 0.27–0.32%, data not shown). However, the effect of different light sources and genotypes on major compounds of lemon balm essential oil was significant (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). A total of thirty-eight compounds were identified using GC–MS analysis (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). A considerable difference was observed in the concentration of essential oil constituents in both genotypes of 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> grown under various light sources (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). In plants of Ilam genotype, ß-cubebene and citronellal had the lowest and highest amounts among all of the identified constituents under red and red + blue LEDs, respectively with 0.6 and 15.3%, but in the other genotype, the lowest amount of essential oil compounds belonged to bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one, ß-ionone, and eugenol in plants that were subjected to red, blue, and red + blue LEDs (0.8%). Among essential oil compounds, citronellal had the highest content (17.2%) under red + blue LED lights in the Isfahan genotype.
