<p id="Par31">In the study by Batista et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2016</xref>) on three chemotypes of 
 <italic>Lippia alba</italic>, they demonstrated that the differences in the composition of essential oil were more influenced by the chemotype than light treatments (LED and fluorescent) applied. They and Viccini et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2014</xref>) stated that this difference between genotypes and chemotypes could be depended on the content of plant DNA.
