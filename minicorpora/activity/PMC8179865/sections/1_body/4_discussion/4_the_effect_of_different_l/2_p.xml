<p id="Par39">Many studies have shown that LED lights induced several metabolic changes in plants, including increased levels of β-farnesene, germacrene-D, and elements in Mexican mint grown under blue light (Noguchi and Amaki 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2016</xref>). Alvarenga et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2015</xref>) showed that high light intensities, such as 47 and 69 μmol.m
 <sup>−2</sup>.s
 <sup>−1</sup> increased monoterpene compounds content in 
 <italic>Achillea millefolium</italic> L., but these intensities reduced the number of sesquiterpenes. Sesquiterpenes such as ß-caryophyllene and ß-cubebene have the highest values ​​at 13 μmol.m

 <italic>Mentha spicata</italic> increased ß-caryophyllene compared to the control condition. The concentration of beta-bourbonene as a sesquiterpene was also higher in mint cultivated under LED light compared to the control condition (Nguyen and Saleh

 <italic>Perovskia</italic> has also been reported under the white LED light (Ghafari et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2019</xref>). Tohidi et al.'s (
