<p id="Par37">It is well known that the increase in the production of secondary metabolites is related to plant growth conditions such as temperature, light regime, stress, nutrition source, etc. (Selmar and Kirinwächter 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2013</xref>). If the light energy that is absorbed by the photosynthetic apparatus exceeds the energy required for CO
 <sub>2</sub> fixation, large amounts of this energy ultimately led to the production of secondary metabolites according to the energy dissipation mechanism proposed by Selmar and Kirinwächter (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2013</xref>). In the present study, since the intensity of light in LEDs (300 μmol.m
 <sup>−2</sup>.s
 <sup>−1</sup>) is continuously higher than greenhouse conditions, these light sources, especially red + blue LED light, can be considered as severe light stress and probably increased monoterpenes according to the mechanism described above. Recently, researchers have found that terpenoids biosynthesis in addition to the mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway is made from primary metabolites through another pathway called methylerythritol phosphate (MEP), which is present in plastids and chloroplasts (Lichtenthaler et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1999</xref>). Therefore, it can be stated that under the treatment of LED lights, especially under red + blue LED light, due to the matching of these wavelengths to the absorption peak of photosynthetic pigments, LEDs increased photosynthesis and production of photosynthetic intermediates, especially IPP (isopentenyl diphosphate). This process may have resulted in the activation of the MEP pathway more and more and produced high levels of these terpenoids.
