<p id="Par11">Many secondary metabolites, such as flavonoids, essential oils, and phenolic acids are produced in response to environmental stresses (Weitzel and Peterson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2010</xref>). light, As an important environmental factor, is an essential source of energy for the photosynthesis of a plant, as well as an important message for plant growth and development. Nowadays, new technologies such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) lamps provide better growth of plants by emitting an appropriate intensity and wavelength of light as an alternative source for sunlight (Sabzalian et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2014</xref>). LEDs can also stimulate the generation of secondary metabolites and essential oils in plants (Ghaffari et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2019</xref>; Tohidi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2019</xref>). Blue LED light made the highest amount of essential oil in basil leaves (Amaki et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2011</xref>) and 
 <italic>Perovskia atriplicifolia</italic> (Gaffari et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2019</xref>). The highest thymol content was observed in 
 <italic>Thymus migricus</italic> under blue LED light (Tohidi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2019</xref>). Red LED light significantly increased lutein and glycosinolate in 
 <italic>Brassica oleracea</italic> leaf (Lefsrud et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2008</xref>) and phenylacetaldehyde in 
 <italic>Petunia hybrid</italic> flower (Colquhoun et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2013</xref>). Sabzalian and co-workers (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2014</xref>) recorded a four-fold increase in essential oil production of 
 <italic>Mentha longifolia</italic> under red + blue LED light. The positive effect of blue, white, and green LED lights was equally reported by Jung et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2013</xref>) on the antioxidant activity of rice leaves. Johkan and his colleagues (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2010</xref>) also stated that the antioxidant activity of lettuce seedlings treated with blue LEDs was higher than that of red and fluorescent lights. Additionally, the variability among plant genotypes influences the quantity and quality of secondary metabolites, which leads to great differences in secondary metabolite synthesis (Gahler et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2003</xref>). Several studies have revealed that the essential oil components and yield can vary with plant genotypes (Rajendra et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2016</xref>; Gholami-Zali and Ehsanzadeh 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2018</xref>). However, little data have been published about the variation in the essential oil composition between the lemon balm genotypes.
