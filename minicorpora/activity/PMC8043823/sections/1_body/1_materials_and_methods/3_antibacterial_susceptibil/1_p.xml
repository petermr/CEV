<p>The susceptibility of both bacterial strains to 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> essential oil was determined by the agar disk diffusion method according to the Clinical &amp; Laboratory Standards Institute (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). To prepare paper disks, 10 μl of the 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> essential oil was inoculated onto a sterile Whatman filter paper disk (6 mm diameter). After that Mueller–Hinton agar plates was cultured by surface culture plating with 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic>. Essential oil-inoculated paper discs was transferred on the plates and then the plates were incubated at 37°C for 18–24 h. Antibacterial susceptibility was evaluated by measuring the growth inhibition zones after the incubation period. In addition to 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> essential oil-inoculated paper discs, gentamicin (10 μg) disk was used as a positive antibacterial control.
