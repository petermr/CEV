<p>Inhibition of biofilm formation of 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> essential oil on 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> cells were investigated using the microtiter plate assay. In detail, sterile 96-well polystyrene plates were filled with 98 μl of TSB contained MIC/2 and MIC/4 concentrations of the 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> essential oil (six wells for each concentration). Then, for each of two bacteria, two μl of the inoculum (∼1.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/ml) was added to each well. The negative and positive controls contained TSB-DMSO with bacteria and TSB-DMSO with bacteria and gentamicin (0.1 mg/ml), respectively. After 24 h incubation at 37°C, the supernatant and un-attached cells were removed, and the wells were rinsed with physiological saline for three times. Then, 100 μl Safranin dye (0.1%) solution was added to all wells, and after 20 minutes, the excess dye was removed and washed by physiological saline. Finally, the bound dye was released by adding 100 μl ethanol (95%) and optical density values (OD) were measured using a microplate reader (ELx808, BioTek, USA) at 490 nm. Each assay was repeated three times. As a measure of efficacy, the mean ODs of treated wells were compared with those of negative control (without essential oil) and the inhibition percentage was calculated using the following formula:
