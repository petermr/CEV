<p>Minimum inhibitory concentration of 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> essential oil was determined using broth microdilution method as previously described by Kerekes et al. (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) with some modifications. The dilution of the essential oil was made in Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) culture media (Merck, Germany) in combination with 0.1% of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Merck) to increase solubility of the essential oil. Concentration of essential oil ranged from 0.19 to 25 μl.ml
 <sup>−1</sup> in DMSO-TSB medium prepared into wells of 96-well microtiter plates (SPL, South Korea). One hundred microlitres of fresh cell suspension (5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> CFU.ml
 <sup>−1</sup>) in liquid culture medium was added to the wells. Positive controls contained the inoculated growth medium without any essential oil and negative controls contained essential oil in sterile medium. Plates were aerobically incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The MIC was considered as the lowest concentration of the essential oil at which no visible growth was detected. To determine MBC, 5 μl of each well with no growth in MIC test was cultured on blood agar medium followed by incubation at 37°C for 24 h. The MBC was defined as the lowest concentration at which the original growth was reduced by ≥ 99.9%. The MIC and MBC were performed for each two tested bacteria.
