 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is an important human and animal pathogens which is responsible for a serious public health concern with a significant economic burden. Avian pathogenic 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (APEC) causes extraintestinal infections, known as colibacillosis, which causes extensive mortality in poultry flocks with high economic losses (
