<p>Today, several anti-biofilm strategies are available for the prevention of biofilm formation in bacteria including inhibition via interference in the quorum sensing pathways; adhesion mechanism; and disruption of extracellular DNA, protein, lipopolysaccharides, exopolysaccharides and secondary messengers involved in various signaling pathways (
