<p>Biofilm inhibitory properties were performed at MIC/2 and MIC/4 concentrations of the essential oil. The effect of the 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> essential oil on the biofilm formation at MIC/2 concentration on 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>. The percentage of inhibition of biofilms according to the mentioned formula was 26.8 at MIC/2 concentration. The inhibitory effects on biofilm formation were statistically significant compared to that of control (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). At MIC/4, the tested essential oil did show significant anti-biofilm activity compared to that of control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) and the percentage of biofilm inhibition at MIC/4 concentration was 12.31 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). In case of 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic>, our results revealed that each two tested concentrations (MIC/2 and MIC/4) of essential oil significantly inhibited the biofilm formation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). It should be noted that the comparative results between two tested bacteria by 
 <italic>t</italic>-test indicated that the anti-biofilm effect of the essential oil on 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> is significantly (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) higher than that of 
 <italic>E. coli.</italic>
