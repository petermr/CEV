<p>Based on previous studies, different MIC and MBC values have been reported for this essential oil (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). It is well known that both plant geographic area and genetic factors of studied strain are deeply effective in these observed variations (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The GC-MS analysis results revealed that thymol, γ-terpinene, p-cymene and α-terpinene were the most prevalent components of the tested essential oil. The high antimicrobial activity can be explained by the presence of phenol compound thymol and also terpenes (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The strong antimicrobial properties of these compounds have been reported by other researchers (

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). According to Pei et al. (2009), MIC of thymol against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> was 400 μg/ml (

 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S.</italic> Enteritidis are inhibited by thymol at concentrations between 160 and 320 μg/ml (
