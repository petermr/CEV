<p>In the second part of the study, using the microtiter plate assay, the anti-biofilm properties of the essential oil were studied against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> isolates. Our results showed that essential oil of the 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> inhibited the formation of biofilms at concentrations lower than MIC. This effect on 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> was stronger than 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. In similar previous studies, the anti-biofilm properties of 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> essential oil was studied and confirmed on 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In this study, both MIC and MBC were 0.125 Î¼l/ml and the biofilms were significantly inhibited at MIC/2, MIC/4 and MIC/8 concentrations (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Therefore, we can conclude that the 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> essential oil is effective on the biofilms of both tested bacteria. Similarly, these anti-biofilm results were shown on staphylococcal cells (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) and periodontal bacteria (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).
