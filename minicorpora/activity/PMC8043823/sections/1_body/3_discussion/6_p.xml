<p>Residence in the biofilm phase offers various advantages to avian pathogenic 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (APEC); the first one is the ability to acquire transmissible genetic elements, such as plasmids, at high level rates and subsequently, increasing ability to cause disease (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). The second one is that, bacteria living in biofilm exhibit enhanced resistance to cleansing and sanitation. This matter is especially significant in poultry production and processing; where biofilms can be developed on environmental surfaces (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Therefore, the use of a biofilm inhibitor such as 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> essential oil can help to reduce bacterial pathogenesis as well as remove bacteria by antimicrobial agents (
