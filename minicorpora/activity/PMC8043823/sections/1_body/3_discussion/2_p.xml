<p>In the present study, we examined the antimicrobial and anti-biofilm effects of 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> L. essential oil against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> bacteria isolated from poultry infections. Our results showed good antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> essential oil against both tested bacterial strains. The antibacterial properties of 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> essential oil has been investigated by previous researchers (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In a study carried out by Mihajilov-Krstev et al. (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), the antibacterial properties of the 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> essential oil was shown on both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and MIC/MBC values were reported in the range of 0.78–25 μl/ml. In a similar study (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), strong growth inhibitory effects of the 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> essential oil against common periodontitis-associated bacteria was reported by Gursoy et al. These researches showed the effects of 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> essential oil on both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
