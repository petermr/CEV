<p>Considering the application of essential oils in various fields, such as adding to food products, treating human and even animal infections from one side, and a dramatic increase in antibiotic resistance on the other side, today, many studies have been conducted to find compounds with anti-biofilm properties (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In order to find these anti-biofilm compounds, researchers have focused on herbal compounds such as extracts and essential oils as these agents are inexpensive and available and have low toxicity to mammalian cells (

 <italic>Origanum majorana, Thymus zygis, Rosmarinus officinalis, Juniperus communis</italic> and 
 <italic>Zengiber officinale</italic> have been recorded for their antibiofilm activities (
