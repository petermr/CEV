 <italic>Satureja hortensis</italic> essential oil with its antimicrobial and especially anti-biofilm properties may play a role in reducing the prevalence of important poultry diseases such as colibacillosis and salmonellosis or decreasing the severity of these diseases. This essential oil can help to strengthen the poultry immune system because it does not cause bacterial death at concentrations lower than MIC. This essential oil can be used as a poultry dietary supplement for both prevention and control purposes. Generally, essential oils, unlike antibiotics, do not cause microbial resistance.
