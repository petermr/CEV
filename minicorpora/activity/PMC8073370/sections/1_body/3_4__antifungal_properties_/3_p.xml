<p>Some research investigated the antifungal activity of BLEO. A study showed that antifungal and aflatoxin suppressor actions of BLEO are related to its main components such as eugenol [

 <xref rid="B40-molecules-26-02321" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Eugenol contains a hydroxyl group that could form hydrogen bonds with the active site on fungal enzymes that are responsible for aflatoxin secretion and later causes denaturation [

Furthermore, docking simulation of eugenol acetate and chavicol acetate in BLEO showed strong interaction to amino acid constructing fungal protein structures, which is predicted to cause metabolic reduction and biomass breaking down, thus reducing fungal virulence [
