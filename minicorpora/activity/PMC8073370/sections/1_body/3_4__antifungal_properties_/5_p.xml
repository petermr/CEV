<p>Hydroxychavicol or 4-allylpyrocatechol isolated from betel leaves was also reported to be effective against various fungi species. The compound could entirely kill 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> at a minimum concentration (400 μg/mL) [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-26-02321" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The killing ability of hydroxychavicol against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>C. glabrata</italic> was dose-dependent. Hydrochavicol demonstrated fungicidal effects against other clinical isolates fungi, with the MICs ranging from 7.81 to 62.5 μg/mL for dermatophytes, 15.62 to 500 μg/mL for yeasts, and 125 to 500 μg/mL for 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species, while the MFCs were found to be equal or two-fold higher than the MICs [
