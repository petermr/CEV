<p>The superior antifungal property of BLEO compared with essential oils from other Mauritius plants such as Psiadia argute, Psiadia terebinthina, Pimenta dioica, Salvia officinalis, Laurus nobilis, Rosmarinus officinalis, Cinnamomum zeylanicum, and Schinus terebinthifolius has been proven. The study revealed that BLEO was the strongest fungicidal agent with the lowest MIC against all the ATCC strains and clinical isolates fungi tested [

A formula of BLEO based microemulsion showed tremendous fungi toxic activity against a selected mold in raw apple juice at low concentration (&lt;0.5 µL/mL). Meanwhile, spore inactivation of A. flavus and P. expansum by BLEO was found at a greater concentration (15 µL/mL) [
