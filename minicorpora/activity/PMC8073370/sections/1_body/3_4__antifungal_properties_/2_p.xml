<p>Ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts of betel leaves were found to be effective against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> isolated from oral thrush patients. The ethyl acetate extract demonstrated the highest inhibition zone compared to extracts from another plant (
 <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic>) and a standard drug (fluconazole) [

 <xref rid="B30-molecules-26-02321" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The killing kinetic study revealed that the fungistatic activity of the ethyl acetate extract was concentration-dependent. Furthermore, other research showed the anticandidal action of water extract from betel leaves. This effect was possibly related to its ability to reduce the cell surface hydrophobicity of several Candida species. Adhesion of fungal species and host tissues is crucial for fungal virulence, especially for successful colonization and infection. Hydrophobic domains in fungal surface proteins which consist of non-polar amino acids are a major factor involved in fungal adhesion. Thus a deviation in hydrophobic affinity produced by 
 <italic>P. betle</italic> extract may influence the adherence mechanism of the fungal cell [
