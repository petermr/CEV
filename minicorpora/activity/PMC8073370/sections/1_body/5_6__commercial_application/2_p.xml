<p>In the food industry, essential oil is a promising food additive to protect and enhance the shelf life of products during processing and storage. BLEO is an ideal food preservative agent due to its antifungal and antioxidant properties [

 <italic>A. flavus</italic>, is an example of fungal contamination in food products. The toxin is known to be hepatocarcinogenic, teratogenic, mutagenic, and immunosuppressive. An investigation revealed that BLEO in apple juice could deactivate spores or inhibit spore germination which is required to limit fungal infection and mycotoxin production [
