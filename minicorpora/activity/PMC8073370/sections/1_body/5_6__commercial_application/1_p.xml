 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-02321" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Thus, future development of medicinal products from betel leaves could be useful for preventing oral diseases, curing dermatophyte infections, and for the treatment and management of other infectious diseases. Additionally, a study has developed a simple, safe, cost-effective, and eco-friendly preparation of silver nanoparticles with polyaniline coating using water extract of betel leaves. The nanoparticles showed potential antibacterial properties and could be further studied in various applications such as medical devices and pharmaceutical and biomedical industries [
