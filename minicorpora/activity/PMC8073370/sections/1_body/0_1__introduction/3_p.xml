<p>In this paper, a review of the literature was conducted to display recent studies (published in 2010â€“2020) on the antibacterial and antifungal properties of betel leaf extract (BLE), essential oil (BLEO), preparations, and isolates. In addition, the phytochemical constituents, safety profiles, and value-added products of betel leaves are also provided. Research on antibacterial and antifungal properties of betel leaves and their safety profiles have established their application as future active and additive ingredients in the pharmaceutical and food industries. Betel leaves are highly abundant and inexpensive, thus supporting their further development in manufacturing commercial products.</p>
