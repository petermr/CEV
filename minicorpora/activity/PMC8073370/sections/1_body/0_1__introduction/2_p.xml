<p>Over the past decades, antibacterial resistance has been threatening humans and has caused a global health crisis. Some bacterial strains are resistant to antibiotics such as vancomycin intermediate 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (VISA), vancomycin-resistant 
 <italic>Enterococcus</italic> (VRE), methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA), and extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESβL) enzyme producing Gram-negative bacteria, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic>, 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>, and 
 <italic>Enterobacter</italic> spp. [

 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. and dermatophytes [

Food spoilage due to pathogen contamination is not only harmful to consumers but also brings heavy economic losses to manufacturers [
