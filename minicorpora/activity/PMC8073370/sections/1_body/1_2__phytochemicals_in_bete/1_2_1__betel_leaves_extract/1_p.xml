 <italic>Piper betle</italic> contains numerous phytochemicals depending on its botanical origin and the solvent used for extraction. A preliminary phytochemical analysis of betel leaves from Malaysia showed that alkaloids, tannins, glycosides, reducing sugars, and saponins were found in the water extract of betel leaves [

 <xref rid="B12-molecules-26-02321" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The highest total phenol, flavonoid, and tannin were found in the acetone, dichloromethane, and ethanol extracts, respectively. The sample of betel leaves collected from Tamilnadu, India is known to contain steroids, tannins, proteins, amino acids, flavonoids, terpenoids, mucilage, volatile oil, saponin, carbohydrates, and fixed oil, but an absence of alkaloids [
