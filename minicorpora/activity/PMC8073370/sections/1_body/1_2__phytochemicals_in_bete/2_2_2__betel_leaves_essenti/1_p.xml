 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-02321" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. GC-MS analysis of BLEO from different places in India showed that phenylpropanoid groups such as acetyl eugenol, eugenol, chavicol, and safrole were the major components [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-02321" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Interestingly, Indian BLEO obtained from the Sagar Bangla cultivar contained chavicol, but not from the Magahi cultivar. The study also revealed that BLEO contained eugenol (40%) and a combination of carvacrol and chavicol (up to 40%) with chavibetol as a marker compound as depicted in

Meanwhile, another study found additional main compounds including estragole, linalool, α-copaene, anethole, and caryophyllene α-terpinene, p-cymene, 1,8-cineole, β-caryophyllene, α-humulene, allyl pyrocatechol, allylcatechol, methyl eugenol, estragol (methyl chavicol), chavibetol, chavibetol acetate, safrol, 4-allyl-2-methoxy-phenolacetate, and 3-allyl-6-methoxyphenol [
