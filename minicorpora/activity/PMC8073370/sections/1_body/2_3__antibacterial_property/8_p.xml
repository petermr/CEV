<p>It is noteworthy that natural products could provide additive antimicrobial activity and modify antibiotic resistance when combining with conventional antibiotics [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-26-02321" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The synergistic effect was found in a combination of ethyl acetate or acetone extract of betel leaves and streptomycin and chloramphenicol against

 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Propionibacterium acnes</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>. The highest synergy was observed when the acetone extract and chloramphenicol combination (70:30) was used against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. However, there was no correlation between phytochemical content and the synergistic effect which indicated a different mechanism of action [

 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-02321" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These results should be further confirmed to assure the effectiveness of betel leaves as an antibacterial potentiating agent.
