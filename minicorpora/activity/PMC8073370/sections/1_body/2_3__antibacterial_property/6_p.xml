<p>A previous study proved the promising antibacterial effect of BLE against oral pathogens including Gram-positive cariogenic bacteria and Gram-negative periodontal pathogenic bacteria. The study also found that 4-chromanol was the compound responsible for the antibacterial and antibiofilm properties of BLE [

 <italic>Vibrio harveyi</italic> [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-26-02321" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The antibacterial effect of BLE was dose-dependent. BLE was also found to be effective in reducing biofilm formation and extracellular polymeric substance production caused by 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and bacterial consortium without increasing the selective pressure for the growth of microorganisms [

 <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> through the inhibition of quorum sensing mediated virulence factors production such as protease and lipase [
