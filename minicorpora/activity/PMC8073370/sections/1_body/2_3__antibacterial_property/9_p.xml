<p>Some research evaluated the antibacterial activity of the BLE or BLEO based preparation against different pathogens. The antibacterial activity of silver-BLE nanoparticles was found to be similar to standard drug (norfloxacin) against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. The nanoparticles also exhibited a bacteriostatic effect on 
 <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Moreover, the previous study concluded that Gram-positive bacteria are more susceptible to silver-BLE nanoparticles rather than Gram-negative bacteria [

 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>, respectively [
