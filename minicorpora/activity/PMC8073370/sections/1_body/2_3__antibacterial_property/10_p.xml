<p>The isolated phenolic compound of BLE, namely hydroxychavicol or allylpyrocatechols, were tested against 
 <italic>Streptococcus sanguinis</italic>, a Gram-positive bacterium that contributes to caries [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-02321" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The compound was a moderate antibacterial agent that functioned by blocking MurA that causes bacterial cell wall disruption. The result exhibited the potential of betel leaves as an alternative effective and efficient treatment for mechanical plaque removal through inhibition of bacterial growth. The isolate could also kill 
 <italic>Streptococcus intermedius</italic> and 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic> by a similar mechanism mentioned above. The study showed that the killing kinetic of 4-allylpyrocatechol was dose and pathogen dependent [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-26-02321" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The overgrowth of these bacteria develops many serious oral infections and are the major cause of caries, gingivitis, and chronic periodontitis [
