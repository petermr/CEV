The bacteria tested included foodborne pathogens and other bacteria, including multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria that cause severe infectious diseases in humans. Most of the published research investigated the antibacterial activity of BLEs resulting from solvents with different polarities such as water, ethanol, ethyl acetate, acetone, and dichloromethane. Each extract contained diverse bioactive compounds which may affect their antibacterial activity [

 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-02321" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The antibacterial tests of betel leaves were varied in methods and results, complicating the comparison between studies. Furthermore, the current review showed that the study of antibacterial activity of BLE was greater than that of BLEO.
