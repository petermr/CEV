<p>A study showed that the ethanol extract of betel leaves was more effective than the water extract with greater inhibition zones. The ethanol extract at 50–100 µg/mL had the maximum inhibition zones (8.9–11.0 mm) on 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and moderate inhibition was observed on 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (&lt;7.2 mm). Meanwhile, the water extract at 50 µg/mL did not actively inhibit bacterial growth [

Among these extracts, acetone and ethyl acetate extracts demonstrated the most remarkable activity against the six bacteria tested, with 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> being the most susceptible one. Moreover, the antibacterial property of BLEs was related to their phenol and flavonoid contents [
