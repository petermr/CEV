<p>In this review, the MBC/MIC ratio was also measured to show the bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects of betel leaves. If the ratio is ≤2, the samples are considered to be bactericidal agents. The bacteriostatic mode of action is reflected when the ratio is ≥4 [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-26-02321" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. BLEO showed only a bactericidal effect and BLE was found to be bacteriostatic and bactericidal. The bactericidal action was reported against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including those classified as MDR bacteria such as ESβL-producing 
 <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, carbapenem-resistant 
 <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> (CRE), Metallo-β-lactamase (MβL)-producing 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, MRSA, and VRE. On the other hand, a bacteriostatic effect was only observed against Gram-positive bacteria 
 <italic>Streptococcus gordonii</italic>.
