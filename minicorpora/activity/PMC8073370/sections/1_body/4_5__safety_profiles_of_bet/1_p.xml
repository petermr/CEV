<p>An acute toxicity study in both male and female ICR mice showed the safety of the methanol extract of betel leaves orally. The median lethal dose (LD50) of the extract was higher than 5000 mg/kg body weight [

There was also an evaluation of oral acute and sub-acute toxicity (28 days) and genotoxicity of an herbal formulation containing betel leaves alcoholic extract in rats and cellular models. This study revealed the absence of major adverse reactions [
