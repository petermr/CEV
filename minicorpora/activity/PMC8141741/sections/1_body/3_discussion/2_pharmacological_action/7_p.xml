<p>Different protein contents e.g., proteases, ribosomal proteins, chitinases etc. isolated from

 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al., 2010</xref>), in larvae the proteases may hydrolyze/digest the proteins necessary for larval migration (

 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">Mansfield et al., 1992</xref>). Chitinases were also identified which can degrade chitin present in the egg shell (
