<p>The ethyl acetate extract of 
 <italic>C. nucifera</italic> presented no acute oral toxicity at the tested doses. However, the intraperitoneal and intramuscular administration was toxic (
 <xref rid="B185" ref-type="bibr">Tayler et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, the hemoglobin level fallen below the normal limit after 8 days, suggesting that the extract could have negative effects if used for longer periods of time (

 <italic>E. staigeriana</italic> essential oil when administered orally was non-toxic, while intraperitoneal administration did not depict similar results (
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">Macedo et al., 2010</xref>). Traditionally, when a substance administered orally and show LD
 <sub>50</sub> value equal to 1000 mg/kg is considered to be safe or less toxic (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Garner et al., 1961</xref>). The observed difference in toxicity may be attributed to the fact that after oral administration, the extract may be poorly absorbed, detoxified by the liver (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Hayes and Loomis, 1996</xref>) or degraded by the stomach and gut digestive enzymes, however, during intraperitoneal administration the absorption is systematic and toxicity is stronger and appear earlier (
