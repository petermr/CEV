<p>Safety issues of herbal medicines have been remained a big question and scientists are being interested in herbal medicines for decades. The notion that “natural” equals “safe” is apparently deceptive, since natural products comprise pharmacologically active compounds which, when taken in high doses or in specific conditions, can be detrimental to health. Bromelain of 
 <italic>A. comosus</italic> is non-toxic and considered safe without any adverse effects and has shown good absorption and therapeutic benefits (
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">Maurer, 2001</xref>). Moreover, no alteration in body weight, food, and water consumption was observed. The enzymes, urea, and creatinine levels of serum were also unaltered and no significant difference was observed (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Dutta and Bhattacharyya, 2013</xref>). 
 <italic>A. millefolium</italic> aqueous extract oral and intraperitoneal administration produced no significant biochemical and histopathological changes in Wistar rats (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Cavalcanti et al., 2006</xref>). No relevant signs of toxicity were observed for longer periods of exposure, however, slight changes in blood glucose and cholesterol levels, and liver weight were detected, neither correlated with dose or period of exposure nor suggestive of toxicity (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Cavalcanti et al., 2006</xref>). 
 <italic>C. sativum</italic> was safe and no effects on hematological profile, histology, relative organ weights, and plasma markers of damage vital organs were found. However, a significant body weight loss was observed due to reduction in food intake (
 <xref rid="B155" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2012</xref>), which is suggestive of the disturbances in carbohydrates, proteins, and fats (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Ecobichon and Klaassen, 2001</xref>). 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> was safe and produced no toxic effects when tested against mice peritoneal macrophages (
 <xref rid="B173" ref-type="bibr">Santoro et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, 
 <italic>C. schoenanthus</italic> depicted no toxicological effects on hepatic and renal parameters in lambs (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">Katiki et al., 2012</xref>).
