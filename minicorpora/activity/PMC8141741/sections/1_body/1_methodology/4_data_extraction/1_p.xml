<p>Endnote (Thomson Reuters, San Francisco, CA, United States) was used to compile the articles. Researchers very carefully extracted all the data from the selected articles including author (s) name, country name, plant name, family name, plant part used, plantsâ€™ life form, extract used, concentration, time exposure, inhibition, and year of publication. Data were arranged into tables and figures. Chemical structures of the compounds were drawn using MarvinSketch (18.24.0) (
