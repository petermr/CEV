<p>Out of the total reported plant species 171 plant species were evaluated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and only 40 plant species 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> against 
 <italic>H. contortus</italic>. It is evident that 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies were almost five times greater than 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies. Mostly, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies were carried out in Brazil (
 <italic>n</italic> = 29 studies), then in Pakistan (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10 studies), and India (
 <italic>n</italic> = 9 studies) among others. Similarly, 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies were also mostly reported from Brazil and India, 10 and 4 studies, respectively, (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Most of the pharmacological studies were reported in the year 2019 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 15) and 2006, 2011, 2012 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 9) in each (
