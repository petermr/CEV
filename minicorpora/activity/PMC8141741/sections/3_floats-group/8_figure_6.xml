  <p>Schematic representation of mechanism of action and different pharmacological targets of plant extracts/compounds 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Essential oils alter the permeability and cause depolarization of cytoplasmic membrane by interacting and disrupting the chemical structures of lipids, polysaccharides, and phospholipids 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Condensed tannins (CT) bind to the cuticle proteins thus, inducing chemical and physical damage 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Artemisinin disrupts the mitochondrial membrane potential and releases cytochrome c into the cytoplasm leading to inhibition of electron transfer and oxidative phosphorylation 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Allium sativum inhibits Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) that hydrolyzes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Inhibition of ACheE leads to the accumulation of acetylcholine at the synaptic junction and disrupting the neuromuscular transmission which causes muscle paralysis.
