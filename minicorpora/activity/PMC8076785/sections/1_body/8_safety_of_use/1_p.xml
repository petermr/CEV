 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> and the oils and extracts derived from this species as safe for use (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Food and Drug Administration, 2020</xref>). However, there have been reports of potential toxicity of the main components of the essential oil of the plant–estragole and methyl eugenol (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Obolskiy et al., 2011</xref>). Methyl eugenol and estragole, as components of 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic>, have both undergone extensive safety checks. Tests on animals administered estragole orally or subcutaneously have shown induction of liver tumors in mice. The appearance of tumors is associated with the formation of 1′-hydroxyestragole. This metabolite was also present in the urine of men who were given 100 μg of estragole for six months. Both compounds (estragole and 1′-hydroxyestragole) promoted abnormal DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes, in both

 <italic>in vitro</italic> tests (
