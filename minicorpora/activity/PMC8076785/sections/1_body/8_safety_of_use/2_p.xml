<p>Methyl eugenol has also been found to induce liver tumors in animal studies (rats and mice) and, additionally, the formation of neuroendocrine tumors in the glandular stomach.

High doses of methyl eugenol (minimum 30 mg/kg for 25 days) induce auto-induction of P450 cytochromes, leading to the formation of the carcinogenic 1′-hydroxymethyl eugenol.
