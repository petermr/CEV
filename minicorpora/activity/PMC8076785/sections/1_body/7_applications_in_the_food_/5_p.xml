<p>A notable potential application of 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> essential oil is in edible antibacterial films used to prevention food spoilage. In 2020 a study by Socaciu and co-authors confirmed the antibacterial and antioxidant activity of tarragon oil. Moreover, the experiment also evaluated the influence of the oil on the qualities of edible antibacterial film. The results show that the application of essential oil in the film forming solution improved water solubility, protection against VIS light, puncture resistance, elasticity and transparency of the film and an increased of its moisture content. Therefore, tarragon oil can be considered an alternative to synthetic compounds in food packaging applications (
