 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> has been a frequent subject of research in the last few years, regarding both the chemistry and biological activity of extracts obtained from the herb and/or leaves, and the essential oil. Phytochemical tests have confirmed the presence of numerous flavonoid compounds, phenolic acids, coumarins and alkamides in the herb and leaves, as well as a very high variability of the chemical composition of the essential oil. Contemporary research on the biological activity of the above-mentioned raw materials has proven new findings in their activityâ€“antibacterial, antifungal and antiprotozoal effects, as well as extremely valuable antioxidant, immunomodulatory and antineoplastic properties. These studies have also proven hepatoprotective, hypoglycaemic and thyroid-regulating effects. An antidepressant effect has also been documented. The anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects known from traditional medicine applications have also been confirmed.
