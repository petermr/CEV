<p>In 2012, scientists developed an efficient protocol for micropropagation of the French variety of 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic>. Plant cuttings 20 mm long were cut into 1 mm long pieces. These were then used to establish cultures in Murashige &amp; Skoog (MS) liquid media, with five apical meristems as the experimental unit. In order to propagate the plant material, the established cultures were transferred to solid MS media. The tested propagation protocols differed from one another in the concentrations of indole acetic acid (IAA) and kinetin (KIN) added to the medium. The MS medium enriched with only 0.1 mg/L each of IAA and KIN, proved to be the most effective. The length of the sprouts was 11.19 mm and the multiplication index was 1.97. Thirteen days after planting, 100% rooting was achieved. As an alternative method of propagation, the authors of the study placed the propagating pieces horizontally on a solid MS medium supplemented with 0.5 mg/L KIN and 0.5 mg/L IAA. The sprout length was 10.31 mm and the multiplication index was 1.87; good callus induction and leaf development were also demonstrated. The time required to establish the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> culture was three weeks (
