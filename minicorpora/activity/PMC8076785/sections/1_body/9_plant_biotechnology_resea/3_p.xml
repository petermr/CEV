<p>Türközü et al. also undertook to develop an 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> micro-propagation protocol. They proved that the highest efficiency (92%) could be obtained by growing cultures in MS medium supplemented with 1.8 µM 6-benzyladenine (BA) and 0.3 µM 1-naphthylacetic acid (NAA). They also reported an adverse effect of the addition of gibberellic acid (GA
 <sub>3</sub>) on microshoot development. The longest roots were obtained in the plants grown on MS medium with the addition of indolelbutyric acid (IBA) at a concentration of 0.5 mg/L (44 mm) and on ½ MS medium with 0.5 mg/L IBA (46 mm) (
