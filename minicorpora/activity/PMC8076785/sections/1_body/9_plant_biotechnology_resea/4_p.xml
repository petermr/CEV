<p>Another team of Ibrahim et al. has tested the performance of various explants–leaves, stems and roots of 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> in establishing 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures. Leaf explants placed on MS medium supplemented with 1.0 mg/ml of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) proved to be the best starting material for callus induction. For root and stem explants, no statistically significant effects were obtained. It was also proved that the best callus induction was caused by the addition of 0.5 mg/L BA and 0.1 mg/L NAA (75 shoots). It was also shown that the concentration of estragole in the cultured plants correlated with the type of explant and the phytohormone concentrations used. Estragole was not detected in the roots; the highest amount of it (16.7% estragole per g dry weight) was isolated from one-node cultures after the application of 0.5 mg/L 2,4-D (
