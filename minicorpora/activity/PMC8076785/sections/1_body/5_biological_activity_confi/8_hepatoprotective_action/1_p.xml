<p>The hepatoprotective activity of a hydro-alcoholic extract of the herb of 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> was confirmed in 2018 as part of the cooperation between three research centers in Iran. In the course of the experiment, rats were given 50, 100, or 200Â mg/kg of the extract for 15 days, followed by a single dose of carbon tetrachloride. Evidence was documented of a reduction in the levels of alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin, as well as a total protein increase. Histopathological examination also confirmed less liver damage in the group of animals given the herbal hydro-alcoholic extract (
