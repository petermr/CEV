<p>Researchers from Mexico have assessed the effect of 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> leaf extract on the proliferation of mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells. Extraction of the plant material was performed with hexane, ethyl acetate, acetone, ethanol, acetonitrile and supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO
 <sub>2</sub>). Anti-tumor activity was assessed using a tumor growth inhibition test that included measuring ascitic fluid volume and the number of tumor cells after administration of the plant extract to mice. In the control group the tumor cell count was 17.969 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>, whereas in the group of mice receiving the acetonitrile extract from 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> leaves the cell count was 0.1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>. Oral administration of the extract obtained with supercritical carbon dioxide reduced the number of cells to 12.9 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>, whereas intraperitoneal administration of the same extract reduced the number of cells to 0.1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>. The anti-tumour activity of the acetonitrile extract is likely related to the high concentration of polyphenols, and the effect of the scCO
 <sub>2</sub> extract is attributed to the presence of a higher concentration of alkamides in it (
