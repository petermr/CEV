<p>The effect of hydro-ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> leaves on 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection was investigated. The experiment was carried out on an animal model (mouse). The rodents were treated intraperitoneally with the plant extract in doses of 50, 100, 200 mg/kg, then they were infected with 0.2 ml of a suspension at a concentration of 10
 <sup>5</sup> colony-forming units per millilitre (CFU/ml). After sacrificing the animals, the concentration of the pathogen in liver and kidney homogenates was determined. It was found that the growth of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> was significantly inhibited. For the maximum dose of the extract – 200 mg/kg, the concentration of the pathogen in the liver was 16.08 colony-forming units per gram of test material (CFU/g), and no traces of its presence were found in the kidneys. The amount in the control was 36.28 CFU/g and 53.31 CFU/g, respectively (
