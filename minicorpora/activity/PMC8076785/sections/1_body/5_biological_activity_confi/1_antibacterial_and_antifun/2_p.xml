<p>Two years later, a research team from the same facility conducted another experiment confirming the antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> oil against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella</italic> spp.
 <italic>, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>Corynebacterium diphtheriae</italic>. The essential oil was tested with agar well diffusion. A significant inhibitory effect on the growth of 
 <italic>S. aureus, Proteus</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>C. diphtheriae</italic> bacterial strains was demonstrated. The MIC value for these bacteria was determined using the essential oil at a concentration of 0.03 and 25Â mg/ml (
