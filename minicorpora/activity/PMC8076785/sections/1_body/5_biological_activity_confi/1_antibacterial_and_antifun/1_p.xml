<p>Abdollahnejad et al. conducted a comparative study of the antibacterial potential of 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> herb oil obtained from two different methods: steam distillation and experimentally modified steam distillation. The experiment was carried out using the disk diffusion method and the microdilution method against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella flexneri, S. marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp. All these bacteria were found to be sensitive to the essential oil of 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic>, with 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> showing the largest zone of inhibition (21.5Â mm). The MIC value for Gram-positive bacteria did not differ significantly between oils obtained from the different methods, but a significantly lower MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) value for Gram-negative bacteria was recorded for oil obtained with the modified steam distillation method (
