<p>In 2016, conducted a study evaluating the antibacterial and antifungal activity of hydro-ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>A. dracunculus.</italic> MIC and MBC tests along with the minimum fungicidal concentration test (MFC) were carried out to assess the antimicrobial activity of the extract. The experiment determined significant bactericidal activity of the extract and inhibition of the growth of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus,</italic> methicillin resistant (
 <italic>MRSA</italic>) 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus flavus, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,</italic> antibiotic resistant (A.R) 
 <italic>Pseudomonas eruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli,</italic> A.R. 
 <italic>Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae</italic> strains. 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> being the most sensitive to the influence of hydro-ethanolic extract of tarragon (0.02 MIC; 0.08 MBC) followed by A.R 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (0.04 MIC; 0.08 MBC) and 
 <italic>Enterobacter cloacae</italic> (0.04 MIC; 0.08 MBC). Moreover, application of the extract in fungal colonies confirmed a notable decrement of the growth of the colonies and the fungicidal effect against 
 <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus versicolor, Aspergillus ochraceus, Aspergillus niger, Trichoderma viride, Penicillum funiculosum, Penicillium ochrochloron, Penicillium verrucosum.</italic> The MIC test results didnâ€™t differ significantly in different colonies. Interestingly, 
 <italic>Aspergillus versicolor and Aspergillus niger</italic> had lower responses in the MFC test (0.16) compared with the remaining fungi species (0.08) (
