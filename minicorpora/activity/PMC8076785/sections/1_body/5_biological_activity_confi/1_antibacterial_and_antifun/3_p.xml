<p>Another study evaluating the antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> essential oil was conducted in 2020 by Socaciu et al. The experiment was aimed at assessment of the usability of the oil in antibacterial edible films. Bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities were evaluated with the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion test, the minimum inhibitory concentration test (MIC) and the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) test. The results of the first test revealed the greatest inhibition of the growth of 
 <italic>Salmonella enteritidis</italic> than 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes.</italic> The MIC and MBC tests displayed the highest bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (5.14 MIC; 5.14 MBC) whereas in 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> the bactericidal effect was poorer (5.14 MIC; 10.80 MBC) and lower values of MIC and MBC tests were obtained in 
 <italic>Salmonella enteritidis</italic> (10.80 MIC; 10.80 MBC), and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (10.80 MIC; 22.68 MBC) strains (
