<p>The study assessed whether the 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> herb could be used in hypothyroidism. It was conducted on a group of forty-eight rats in which hypothyroidism was induced by the administration of propylthiouracil. The rodents were orally administered an aqueous extract of the herb. Samples of the animals’ blood were taken during the experiment. A significant increase in the level of thyroxine and triiodothyronine was proven after the administration of 300 mg/kg of the plant extract; moreover, a decrease in the elevated level of thyrotropin was recorded in the negative control group. At a dose of 200 mg/kg, the extract increased the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and the level of glutathione. There was also a decrease in the level of malonaldehyde, a marker of oxidative stress. The research results indicate that 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> aqueous extract may improve the thyroid hormone profile, but further research is needed (
