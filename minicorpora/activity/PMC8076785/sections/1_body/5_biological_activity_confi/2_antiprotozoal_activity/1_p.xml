<p>Iranian researchers have investigated the potential of hydro-ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> in the treatment of leishmaniasis. They tested the effectiveness of various concentrations of the extract (100–1000 μg/ml) by applying them to the promastigote forms of 
 <italic>Leishmania major</italic> grown 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. The recorded MIC values of the extract after 24, 48 and 72 h were: 962.03, 688.36 and 585.51 μg/ml, respectively, which indicates that the plant extract can be used in the treatment of leishmaniasis (
