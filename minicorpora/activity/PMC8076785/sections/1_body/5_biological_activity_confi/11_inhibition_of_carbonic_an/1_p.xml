<p>The study verified whether 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> herb extracts obtained with n-hexane, dichloromethane, ethanol and methanol are inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase I and II (hCA I and hCA II). In the body, these enzymes catalyze the reaction between water and carbon dioxide, which produces a proton and a bicarbonate anion. This reaction has a significant impact on the water content inside the eyeball. With excess fluid build-up, intraocular pressure rises, which can lead to the development of glaucoma. In the study, the highest activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.02 μg/ml for hCA I, and IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.31 μg/ml for hCA II) was demonstrated for the dichloromethane extract. In order to determine the active compounds responsible for the action, the following main components were isolated from the dichloromethane extract: 
 <italic>trans</italic>-anethole, stigmasterol, herniarin (2E, 4E)-N-isobutylundeca-2,4-diene-8,10-diynamide (2E, 4E)-1-(piperidin-1-yl)undeca-2,4-diene-8,10-diyn-1-one and 1-(4′-methoxyphenyl)-1,2,3-trihydroxypropane. All these compounds inhibited the activity of hCA I and hCA II. The action of 1-(4′-methoxyphenyl)-1,2,3-trihydroxypropane was more potent than that of the control acetazolamide. On the basis of their research, the authors of the study concluded that 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> herb extracts, like anhydrase I and II inhibitors, can reduce the accumulation of fluid inside the eyeball and thus be used in the treatment of glaucoma (
