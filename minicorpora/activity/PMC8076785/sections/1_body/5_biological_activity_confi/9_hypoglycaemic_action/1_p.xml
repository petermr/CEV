<p>The effect of ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> herb on controlling glycaemia, insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion was tested. For this purpose, a randomized, double-blind clinical trial was conducted in 24 patients diagnosed with impaired glucose tolerance. Twice daily, the encapsulated ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> was administered at 1000 mg for 90 days. The documented results show a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure (120 mm Hg in the control group, 113 mmHg in the test group), a decrease in glycosylated hemoglobin concentration (5.8% in the control group, 5.6% in the test group), a decrease in the area under the curve for insulin levels (56.136–27.426 pmol/L in the control group, 44.472 to 23.370 pmol/L in the test group), and a reduction in the insulinogenic index (0.45–0.23 in the control group, 0.35 to 0.18 in the test group). HDL cholesterol levels increased. The results of the study showed that 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> herb extracts may in future be used as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of impaired glucose tolerance (
