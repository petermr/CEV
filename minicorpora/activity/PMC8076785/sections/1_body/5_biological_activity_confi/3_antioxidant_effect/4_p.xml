<p>In 2017, the researches from Iran and USA together also carried out DPPH tests, in addition to the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) test. For the experiment, hydro-methanolic extracts were used, which were prepared from the herb of 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> collected from various parts of Iran. The results showed that the antioxidant potential depended on the region from which the harvested plants originated. It was positively correlated with the concentration of compounds with phenolic and flavonoid structures. The highest reducing capacity was proven for extracts from the 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> herb collected in Birjand (a city in eastern Iran) – in the DPPH test the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value was 0.039 mg/ml; in the FRAP test the extract was reduced 148.29 μmol Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>/g dry weight. The total amount of phenols calculated as gallic acid equivalents was 96.52 mg/g dry weight, and the total amount of flavonoids calculated as rutoside equivalents was 50.4 mg/g dry weight (
