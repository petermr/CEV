<p>The antioxidant potential of 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> was assessed. For this purpose, fresh tarragon, purchased from the local market, was subjected to extraction with water and ethanol. The extract underwent a DPPH test and was used to determine total amounts of phenols and flavonoids by the spectrophotometric method. The estimated total phenolic content was 24.1 mg/g dry weight (as gallic acid eq.) and the total flavonoid content was 20 mg/g dry weight (as quercetin eq.). In the DPPH test, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value was 65.5 μg/ml, which confirms that 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> extracts can produce antioxidant effects (
