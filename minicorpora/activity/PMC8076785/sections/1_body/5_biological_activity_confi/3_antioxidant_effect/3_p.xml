<p>The antioxidant activity of hydro-ethanolic extract of tarragon was also evaluated. First, Ribeiro et al. analyzed the phenolic content of the extract with HPLC. The results showed 147.5 mg of the phenolic content in 1g of the dried product including approximately 31.9 mg/g of flavonoids and 115.6 mg/g of phenolic acids. Then the team used different methods of assessing the antioxidant activity: the DPPH test examining radical scavenging activity, the β-carotene/linoleate test, reducing power was measured by the capacity to convert Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> to Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> and the TBARS assay evaluating the level of lipid peroxidation. Ribeiro et al. used ascorbic acid as a positive control. The results displayed that the extract is most effective as a reducing agent (
