<p>The Iranian research centers have investigated the antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory potential of an ethanolic extract from the 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> herb. The potential analgesic effect was verified in an animal model (mouse) using the hot plate test, the writhing test and the formalin test. Anti-inflammatory activity was assessed in a xylene-induced ear edema model. The study group received intraperitoneally the herbal ethanolic extract in doses of 5, 10, 50, or 100 mg/kg BW (body weight), while the control group was intraperitoneally administered a saline solution. Reduction in pain sensation was observed in all three tests. In the hot plate test, the extract administered in doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg increased the pain threshold after one hour. Interaction with opioid receptors may be responsible for the analgesic effect of the plant extract, as administration of naloxone to the animals reduced the antinociceptive effect of the extract. Anti-inflammatory activity has also been confirmed a significant reduction in ear edema was demonstrated with the extract administered in doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg (
