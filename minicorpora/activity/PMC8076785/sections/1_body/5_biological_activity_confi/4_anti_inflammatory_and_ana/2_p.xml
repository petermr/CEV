<p>A study carried out by Majdan et al. mentioned above, evaluated the anti-inflammatory activity of aqueous extract of 
 <italic>A. dracunculus.</italic> In the experiment researchers used neutrophils derived from venous peripheral blood from healthy human donors. Thereafter, to assess the secretion of cytokines after the incitement of neutrophils, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used. The application of aqueous extract of tarragon produced a decrement of the release of IL-8 (by 4.0 and 4.8%) and TNFÎ± (by 7.8 and 5.2%). Moreover, ROS production was also measured. It was evaluated by microplate reader which displayed an inhibition of ROS production by 1.4% (
