<p>An experiment was conducted on laboratory animals (mice) to evaluate the immunomodulatory properties of an aqueous extract of 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> herb. The mice were immunized intraperitoneally with sheep erythrocytes then orally administered an aqueous extract of the 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> herb. An increase in the level of antibodies to sheep erythrocytes and a decrease in cellular immunity were documented. The treatment was also shown to reduce the production of pro-inflammatory agents–IL-17 and IFN-γ, and to increase the phagocytic potential of macrophages. The authors of the study concluded that an aqueous extract of the 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> herb could be a good immunomodulating agent; moreover, it was free from potentially harmful estragole and methyl eugenol (
