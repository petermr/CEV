<p>Studies of Modaresi et al. determined the effect of hydro-ethanolic extract from 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> leaves on the hematological parameters of mice. The parameters assessed were levels of leukocytes, erythrocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes and neutrophils. It was demonstrated that intraperitoneal administration of the extract at a dose of 200Â mg/kg significantly increased the level of neutrophils in the blood of rodents and reduced lymphocyte levels. There were no significant effects on the number of leukocytes, red blood cells or monocytes (
