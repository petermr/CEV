<p>The studies on the potential use of aqueous extract of 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> in the treatment of multiple sclerosis were performed, too. The experiments were carried out on mice in which autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was induced with the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein. This model is an experimental animal model for multiple sclerosis. It has been proven that giving rodents aqueous extract of 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> significantly alleviates the symptoms of the disease. By using the iron (III) reduction method, an increase in the antioxidant potential was verified. The use of the extract also reduced the level of inflammatory cytokines (IL-17 and IL-23) and the infiltration of leukocytes into brain cells. The results of the study indicate that the compounds contained in 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> can potentially be used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (
