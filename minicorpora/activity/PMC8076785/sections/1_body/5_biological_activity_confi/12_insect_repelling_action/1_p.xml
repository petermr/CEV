<p>Italian researchers have verified that the essential oil obtained from the herb 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> can act as a repellent against a species of dipterous flies–
 <italic>Calliphora vomitoria</italic> (the blue bottle fly). The insect, which is a synanthropic species, is responsible for the transmission of many pathogenic microorganisms–
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium, Entamoeba coli</italic>, and 
 <italic>Giardia duodenalis</italic>. Larvae that hatch from its eggs deposited on animal or human tissue cause myiasis. The essential oil of the plant has been shown to deter 
 <italic>C. vomitoria</italic> from laying eggs in fresh beef. At an oil concentration of 0.05 μL/cm
 <sup>2</sup>, complete inhibition of egg laying by the insect was demonstrated (
