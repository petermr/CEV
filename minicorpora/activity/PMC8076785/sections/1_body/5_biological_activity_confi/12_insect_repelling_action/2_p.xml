 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Osanloo et al. (2017)</xref> conducted a study confirming larvicidal activity of tarragon essential oil against 
 <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic>â€“mosquitos that are responsible for spreading malaria in the Arabian Peninsula, Indian subcontinent, Afghanistan and Iran. Chemical larvicides which are widely used to control the disease cause environmental pollution and desensitization of some species to active agents. Therefore, nanoemulsion of 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> essential oil was tested as a natural alternative to chemical products. The results showed that nanoemulsion consisting of 0.35% tarragon oil, 10% of Tween 20 and deionized water has a comparable larvicidal activity to chemical larvicides (
