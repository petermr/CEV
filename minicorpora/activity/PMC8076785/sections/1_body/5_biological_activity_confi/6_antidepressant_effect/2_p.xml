<p>An experiment conducted in 2019 has confirmed the antidepressant activity of the species. Harvested herb of 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> was subjected to extraction with ethanol, then the activity of the extract was assessed on animals (NMRI mice and Swiss mice), by performing the forced swim test, the writhing test, and the open-field test. The results of the study showed a reduction in immobility time in the forced swim test (for the extract dose of 400 mg/kg the immobility time was 153.6 s, and was shorter compared to the control group, in which the immobility time was 202.3 s), a reduction in immobility time in the writhing test (for the extract dose of 200 mg/kg the period of immobility was 117.2 s, and was shorter compared to the control group, in which the immobility time was 142.6 s). In the open-field test, the rodents’ mobility did not change significantly, except for the trial with Swiss mice, which were administered 100 mg/kg of 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> herb extract.
