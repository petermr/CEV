<p>In 2020 scientists from Turkey carried out an experiment evaluating the influence of 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> extracts on human monoamine oxidase A (hMAO-A) and monoamine oxidase-B (hMAO-B). Isoenzymes are an important factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease as well as in depression. Inhibitors of the enzymes have displayed efficiency in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and they are being used in treatment of clinical depression and anxiety. The teams prepared extracts of tarragon with different solvents: ethyl acetate, acetone, methanol and water to compare the activity of various types of extracts. Moreover, pure metabolites herniarin and skimmin were also tested to verify their influence on the isoenzymes. The results determined a nonselective and lower inhibitory activity of tarragon extracts and pure metabolites on hMAO-A and hMAO-B in comparison with reference inhibitors (Selegiline and Clorgyline). The most effective of the extracts proved to be the methanol extract. Interestingly, pure metabolites had lower inhibitory activity on hMAO-A and hMAO-B compared with extracts. In this regard, the researchers suggested that there are synergistic interactions between compounds of the extract (
