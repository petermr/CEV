 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> has low requirements in terms of cultivation site and care, but the highest yields are obtained from crops growing on moist, sandy-clay soils with an alkaline reaction. This species, depending on the cultivar, can be propagated vegetatively or from seed (Russian tarragon), or solely vegetatively from rhizome cuttings (French and German tarragon). It is also possible to use the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> micropropagation protocols developed for this species–described later in this review. In European conditions, plantations are established in april. The cuttings are placed in rows spaced at 60 cm and covered with a thin layer of soil. The first harvest of the herb takes place in dry weather in the same year, while in the following years two-to-three harvests can be gathered per year. The collected raw material is dried in drying sheds with natural air circulation or heated to 35°C. After drying, the leafy parts of the tarragon plant are separated from the hard stems (
