<p>The term “dracunculus” was often used by ancient authors, e.g. by Dioscorides (1st c. AD), to refer to another species–
 <italic>Arum dracunculus</italic> L. (Gr. Drakontaia megale, Δρακονταία μεγάλή), or 
 <italic>Arum maculatum</italic> L. (Gr. Drakontaia mikre, Δρακονταία μικρή) (

 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> L. was commonly called draco, e.g. the botanist and German physician Valerius Cordus (16th c.) uses the name Draco sativus. Due to the similarity of dracunculus leaves to those of flax, it was believed to grow from flax seeds embedded in a hollowed-out onion (
 <italic>ex semine lini in cepe</italic>), meaning that it did not grow naturally. Authors such as K. Gessner (Bibliotheca Universalis 1545), P. Matthiolus (Commentarii in sex libros Pedacii Dioscoridis Anazarbi de Medicina material 1570) and J. Dalechamps (Historia Generalis Plantarum 1586) did not agree with this view (
