<p>According to Pliny the Elder (1st c. AD), the name 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> L., a diminutive of the Latin word “draco” – dragon (Gr. δράκων), dracunculus–a small dragon, was given to this plant because of its serpentine rhizomes (

 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> might also be a distorted version of the Arabic name for tarragon, i.e. tharchum, from which the synonyms tarchon, tarcon and torchun are derived (
