<p>In order to determine the mechanism of actions, MCEO was tested on pylorus ligation-induced ulcer model. It was reported that the ulcer formation in gastric is due to the imbalance between offensive and defensive mucosal factors [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Therefore, it is an ideal model to examine the mechanism on how a drug works as an anti-ulcerogenic agent. The main cause is due to the accumulation of gastric acid and pepsin, which lead to the damage on the gastric mucosal barrier [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Based on the results, only 100 mg/kg of MCEO and ranitidine produced a significant reduction in the ulcer area with 43% and 46% of protections, compared to the disease control group. In addition, insignificant reduction in gastric volume was observed in all tested concentrations of the MCEO compared to the disease control group. However, significant increases were observed in pH, total acidity, and gastric wall mucus. Therefore, the protection offered by MCEO in the pylorus ligation setting may be due to acid neutralising effect and the upregulation of mucus secretion. These properties may be partly due to the fact that the phytochemical constituents present in MCEO, such as sesquiterpenes, phenylpropanoids, monoterpenes, and trans-nerolidol, were the major constituents found in the essential oil of 
 <italic>M. charantia</italic> which were revealed by the previous studies [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Current data also showed that the reference drug, ranitidine, which was used for this study successfully suppressed ulcer induced by EtOH/HCl and indomethacin in all parameters. On top of that, effect of the highest concentration of MCEO (100 mg/kg) was shown to be comparable to ranitidine, suggesting that MCEO protects gastric ulcer formation which might be associated with inhibition of histamine H2 receptor. However, further experiments need to be carried out in order to confirm this hypothesis.
