<p>Over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to relieve pain and inflammation. However, frequent and long-term administration of NSAIDs, such as aspirin and indomethacin, could become a risk factor of gastric ulceration. NSAIDs cause damage to the gastric mucosa via several mechanisms, including topical irritant effect on epithelium, disruption of mucosa barrier properties, inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, decrease in mucosal blood flow, and interference with the re-epithelisation of the ulcer [

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Moreover, indomethacin-induced gastric mucosa damage could also be associated with reactive oxygen species [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Gastric prostaglandins play an important role in protecting the mucosal layers by stimulating the secretion of mucus, maintaining local blood flow, and increasing the resistance of epithelial cells to be damaged by cytotoxins [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, suppression of prostaglandins by indomethacin increased the susceptibility to gastric mucosal lesions, as shown by disease control group in the current study. Interestingly, oral administration of MCEO in rats has significantly suppressed the damage to mucosa at all concentrations tested when compared with the disease control group. This demonstrates that MCEO is able to protect the gastric mucosa and suggests the possible involvement of prostaglandins and mucus productions. Sathishsekar et al. [

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] have reported that 
 <italic>M. charantia</italic> seed extract significantly inhibited the toxic effects caused by free radicals by enhancing the enzymatic antioxidant defence system, such as glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutases (SOD), and catalase (CAT). Thus, it can be postulated that the inhibitory properties of MCEO may also be due to its antioxidant activity and the ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species produced by indomethacin.
