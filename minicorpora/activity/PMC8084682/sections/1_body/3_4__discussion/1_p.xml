<p>Ethanol is one of the causative agents that lead to gastric ulcer formation and mucosa erosion [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In addition, studies have also reported that the administration with the combination of HCl/ethanol induced ulceration by increasing lipid peroxidation in mucosa layer with depletion of endogenous antioxidants [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. It is believed that free radical's production is the aetiology of HCl/ethanol-induced gastric ulcer formation by altering gastric antioxidant defence system. Present data showed that the acidified ethanol led to gastric haemorrhagic erosion in rats. The total area of gastric lesions and ulcer index in the disease control group (treated with distilled water only) were significantly higher than the rest of the treatment groups. In microscopic evaluation, the acidified ethanol also caused significant vacuolation formation, epithelial disruption, and erosion, extending to muscularised layer. However, the gastroprotective efficacy of the MCEO (10, 50, and 100â€‰mg/kg) was evident from significant reduction in the total area of gastric lesions. These data showed that the MCEO was effective in preventing acidified ethanol-induced gastric ulcer, which suggests its cytoprotective effect. Apart from that, it is also known that ethanol altered the gastric mucosa cellular integrity which is associated with oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; thus, based on the observations, MCEO was able to prevent the acidified ethanol-induced gastric ulcer by attenuating oxidative stress or antioxidant effect. Similar findings from the reported studies, showing essential oils, have been proven to prevent gastric mucosal ulceration in rats using this model [
