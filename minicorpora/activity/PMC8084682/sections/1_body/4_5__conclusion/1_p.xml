<p>The results obtained from this study suggested that MCEO could evidently suppress the ulcerations induced by acidified ethanol, indomethacin-induced, and pylorus-ligated. Thus, this study has proved that MCEO is found to exhibit anti-ulcer potential via suppression of free radicals, upregulation of prostaglandins synthesis, and mucus secretion, which favours the healing process for gastric ulcers. These activities may be partly contributed by the phytochemical constituents, present in the MCEO. However, further research is needed for better understanding of the mechanisms and the active bio-compounds present in this essential oil in order to provide a new alternative for the clinical management of gastric ulcers.</p>
