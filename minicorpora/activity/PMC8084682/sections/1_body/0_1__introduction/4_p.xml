<p>Based on the previous studies, 
 <italic>M. charantia</italic> has been shown to have antiulcer activity [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, the evidence was reported from the fruit extract, but not on its seeds. Therefore, this present study is aimed at investigating the antiulcer properties of essential oil isolated from
