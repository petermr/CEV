<p>The experiment was performed based on a slight modification of the method described by Mizui and Doteuchi [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Briefly, experimental animals were fasted for 24 hours with free access to water. Gastric ulceration was induced by oral administration of hydrogen chloride/ethanol (HCl/EtOH, 1 mL/60% EtOH containing 150 mM HCl) solution, 1 mL orally, for all the groups of animals on day 7 after being pretreated with testing sample for 1 hour. The animals were randomly divided into six experimental groups of six rats each. The first group received distilled water only without any inducement, the second group received distilled water but induced with HCl/EtOH (disease control), and the third group (standard) received reference drug, ranitidine (100 mg/kg). Groups 4, 5, and 6 received 10, 50, and 100 mg/kg of MC essential oils (MCEO) based on their body weight (10 mL/kg), respectively. All the treatments were given once daily for 7 consecutive days.
