<p>In order to investigate the underlying mechanism of MCEO in treating pyloric ligation-induced gastric ulcers in rats, method from Shay et al. [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] was adapted. The ulcer formed in the gastric was scored, as in the previous studies [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and the ulcer index for each animal was calculated as the mean ulcer score.
