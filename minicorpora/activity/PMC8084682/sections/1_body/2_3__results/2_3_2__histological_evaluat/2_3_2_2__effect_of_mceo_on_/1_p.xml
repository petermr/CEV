<p>Based on the histopathological analysis, the formation of oedema or vacuolation, epithelial disruption, and mucosae erosion were observed in the disease control group induced with indomethacin only (
 <xref rid="tab6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). MCEO pretreated and reference drug groups showed better preservation of the gastric mucosa. Again, the highest concentration of MCEO (100â€‰mg/kg) exhibited significant reduction in all aspects of ulceration (
 <xref rid="tab6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). MCEO seemed to arrest the ulcerative processes immediately after the mucosal layer was exposed to indomethacin. Furthermore, ranitidine group has also significantly increased the mean score for normal features while reducing the ulceration scores (
 <xref rid="tab6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>).
