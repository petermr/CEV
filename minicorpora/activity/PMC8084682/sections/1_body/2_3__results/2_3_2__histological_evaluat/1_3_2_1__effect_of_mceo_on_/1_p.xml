<p>Histological evaluation was performed to confirm the morphological changes in gastric tissues. As expected, there was extensive damage to the gastric mucosa showing prominent features of oedema and vacuolation, epithelial disruption, and mucosa erosions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) in the disease control group. Based on the scoring system, the oedema or vacuolation, epithelial disruption and erosion scores in the disease control group were much higher than the treatment groups (
 <xref rid="tab5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Surprisingly, the group treated with 100 mg/kg of MCEO significantly decreased the formation of oedema, epithelial disruption, and mucosa erosions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tab5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Also, the group treated with 100 mg/kg of ranitidine successfully reduced oedema and vacuolation formation compared with the disease control group (
 <xref rid="tab5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>).
