<p>In order to evaluate the antiulcer mechanism of actions, MCEO was examined by pyloric ligature-induced gastric ulcers in rat model using parameters including ulcer area, gastric volume, gastric pH, and total acidity (
 <xref rid="tab7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>). Oral administration of MCEO and ranitidine at 100 mg/kg significantly reduced the total ulcer area (mm
 <sup>2</sup>) compared with disease control group (43% and 46% of protections, respectively). Nevertheless, all the concentrations of MCEO failed to increase the gastric volume. However, 50 and 100 mg/kg of MCEO significantly elevated the pH without decreasing the total acidity. Oral treatment of MCEO at concentrations of 50 and 100 mg/kg caused an increase in the amount of adherent mucus compared to the disease control group (
 <xref rid="tab8" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>). As expected, ranitidine enhanced the mucus production; however, its effect is much lesser than MCEO.
