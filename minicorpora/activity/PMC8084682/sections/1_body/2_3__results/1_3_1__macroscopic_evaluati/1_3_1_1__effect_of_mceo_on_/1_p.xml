<p>HCl/EtOH at the dose of 1 mL has significantly induced ulcer formation in the disease control animals (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Furthermore, the ulcer index in the disease control group was also significantly higher than the rest of the groups at 4.0 (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). However, animals treated with MCEO at all concentrations significantly reduced the number of ulcers and ulcer index (Tables 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), showing a dose-dependent manner. Among all the concentrations, 100 mg/kg of MCEO possessed the highest activity, with 91% reduction on ulcer lesions compared with disease control group. Meanwhile, as for ulcer index, 41.75% inhibition was observed compared with the disease control (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Based on the gross appearance, gastric mucosa obtained from the treated group with 100 mg/kg of MCEO clearly showed protection by MCEO, with few ulcers observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). On the other hand, the standard group (ranitidine) also showed a significant reduction in ulcer lesion and index, however, much lesser than the overall concentrations of MCEO, with only 32% and 12.50% reductions in total area of lesion and ulcer index, respectively (Tables 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
