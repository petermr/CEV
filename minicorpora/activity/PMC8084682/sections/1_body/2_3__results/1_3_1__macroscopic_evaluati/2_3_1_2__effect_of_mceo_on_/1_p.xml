<p>As shown in 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, MCEO significantly reduced the total lesion area induced by 100 mg/kg of indomethacin on rats in dose-dependent manner. Compared with all the treatments, 100 mg/kg of MCEO exhibited the highest percentage of anti-ulcerogenic effect (80.0%), comparable to the reference drug, 100 mg/kg of ranitidine (83.2%). From the gross appearance, indeed, all the concentrations of MCEO and ranitidine reduced the ulceration compared to the disease control group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). On the other hand, based on the ulcer scoring system, only 100 mg/kg of MCEO and ranitidine showed significant difference compared with disease control group, while 10 and 50 mg/kg of MCEO did not show significant difference compared with disease control group, despite slight reduction in the ulcer index (
