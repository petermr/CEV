<p id="p0020">One of the important biological properties of these essential oils is their antimicrobial nature, and in many cases this activity was found to be due to the presence of active monoterpene constituents [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Another property of the plant products that is generating considerable interest is their ability to control plant diseases. Till now chemical control remains the main measure to reduce the incidence of plant diseases. Two serious problems, development of resistance by plant pathogenic fungi &amp; bacteria and the presence of high level toxic residues in agricultural products, hamper against the effective use of the chemical fungicides and bactericides in controlling plant pathogenic microbes. Hence the exploitation of natural substances such as essential oils, safer to consumers and the environment, for the control of plant diseases is presently looked upon. Reports by Tahir et al., [
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and Letessier et al., [
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] showed that the application of 0.05% hyssops oil can reduce the rust infection of broad bean caused by 
 <italic>Uromyces viciae-fabae</italic>, while application of 0.05% hyssops oil, post inoculation, reduced the infection of powdery mildew of barley seedlings caused by 
 <italic>Blumeria graminis f. sp. Hordei</italic>.
