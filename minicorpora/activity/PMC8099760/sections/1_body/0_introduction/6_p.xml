<p id="p0030">The essential oils used in the present study were known for their antimicrobial activity. The essential oil of 
 <italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic> (lemon grass) was shown to have appreciable activity against some Gram + bacteria [
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and the essential oil of 
 <italic>C. nardus</italic> (citronella) was shown to have broad spectrum fungistatic activity against 
 <italic>Aspergillus, Chaetomium, Myrothecium, Pencillium and Trichoderma spp</italic>. [
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Further, there is no agreement among various groups of scientists on the preferential ability of plant essential oils to inhibit Gram + and Gram - bacteria. For these reasons there is a need to study the antimicrobial properties of plant essential oils comprehensively. The main objectives of the present study are to explore the antibacterial activity of essential oils and their components against Gram- &amp; Gram- non-pathogenic bacteria, identification of major components of selected essential oils by gas chromatography, to determine the efficacy of essential oils and their major components against human pathogenic drug resistant bacteria, to study the effect of essential oils and their major components on curing of drug resistance plasmid pBR 322 in bacteria (
 <italic>E. coli</italic> HB101); and the activity of β-lactamase in drug resistant bacteria.
