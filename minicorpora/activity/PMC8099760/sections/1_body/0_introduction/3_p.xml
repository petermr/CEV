The ability of these compounds to form complexes with certain enzymes or directly inhibit enzymes, toxic effects on membrane structure and integrity, quenching of free radicals, stimulation of natural killer cells in the humans, modulation of steroid concentrations etc. could be among important mechanisms underlying their biological activity. However, quite often, exact mechanisms in particular cases remain to be clarified [
