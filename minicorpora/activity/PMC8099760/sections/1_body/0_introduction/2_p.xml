<p id="p0010">Plants produce a large and diverse array of organic compounds that appear to have no direct function in growth and development, and these are named as secondary metabolites. They differ from primary metabolites of plants such as chlorophyll, amino acids, nucleotides, simple carbohydrates etc. in having a restricted distribution in the plant kingdom. Plant secondary metabolites can be divided mainly into three chemically distinct groups: Terpenes, Phenolic compounds and Nitrogen-containing secondary products, such as alkaloids, which are primarily biosynthesized from amino acids.</p>
