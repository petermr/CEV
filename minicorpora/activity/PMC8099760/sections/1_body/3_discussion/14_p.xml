<p id="p0355">As it was reported that some phytochemicals have the ability to alter or inhibit the activity of several enzymes, the effect of the test compounds on the ß lactamase was studied. In our studies it was observed that despite the high bactericidal action against drug resistant pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria, none of the test compounds could neither eliminate the plasmid (

 <xref rid="tbl9" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>). We feel that through studies, which are out of scope for present work, on plasmid elimination using properly formulated test compounds needs to be undertaken before coming to any strong conclusion about their ability to cure plasmids.
