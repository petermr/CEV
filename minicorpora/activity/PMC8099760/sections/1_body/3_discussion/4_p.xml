<p id="p0305">Boukhatem et al., [
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], studied the antibacterial activity of the lemongrass essential oil from 
 <italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic> and reported its potent activity against Gram + organisms compared to Gram - organisms. Our present results with lemongrass oil isolated from 
 <italic>Cymbopogon flexousus</italic> show that this particular essential oil is equally effective against both Gram + and Gram - bacteria and shows no preferential activity towards a particular Gram reaction (
