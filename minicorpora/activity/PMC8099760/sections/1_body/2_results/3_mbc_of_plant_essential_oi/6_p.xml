<p id="p0175">The essential oil of citronella displayed only moderate activity against both Gram + and Gram - bacteria. The essential oil of tagetus showed marginal bacterial activity. The essential oil of mentha showed very poor antibacterial activity. The minimum bactericidal concentration of plant essential oils was also checked against two plant pathogenic bacteria viz. 
 <italic>X. oryzae</italic> and 
 <italic>X. malvacearum</italic>. All the plant essential oils showed antibacterial activity against both the bacteria tested. Both 
 <italic>X. oryzae</italic> and 
 <italic>X. malvacearum</italic> showed a very high sensitivity towards lemon grass and palm rosa essential oils. Essential oils of eucalyptus and geranium also showed a very high antibacterial activity against both 
 <italic>X. oryzae</italic> and 
 <italic>X. malvacearum.</italic> Essential oil of citronella inhibited both the organisms at a minimum concentration of 31.25 μl/ml. Essential oils of tagetus and menthe were effective against 
 <italic>X. oryzae</italic> and 
 <italic>X.malvacearum</italic> (
