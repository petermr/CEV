<p id="p0210">Lemon grass essential oil showed best antibacterial activity against all the ten drug resistant pathogenic bacteria tested. The zone of inhibition against all the five 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates at 4 μl concentration was between 9-11 mm, while at 8 μl the inhibition was 21mm against EC-2 and EC-5. Against EC-1, EC-3 and EC-4 isolates the zone of inhibition was 16 mm, 18 mm and 17 mm respectively. Against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> isolates, lemon grass oil at 4μl showed 8–11 mm zones of inhibition and at 8 μl showed 21–22 mm against SA-1, SA-3 and SA-4 isolates, while against SA-2 the zone of inhibition was 17 mm. Lemon grass essential oil against drug resistant 
 <italic>Pseudomonas sp.</italic> isolate showed a zone of inhibition of 7 mm and 12 mm at 4 μl per disc and 8 μl per disc concentrations respectively. The palm rosa oil also showed good antibacterial activity against all the ten pathogenic antibacterial isolates (
