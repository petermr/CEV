<p>After obtaining informed consent, eligible patients after colonoscopy were assessed at baseline for demographic characteristics (gender, age, height, weight, duration of functional dyspepsia, marital status, smoking, coffee drinker, tea drinker, regular meals, diet, stress, and previous drug-taking). They were then randomized to receive either cinnamon oil soft capsule (
 <italic>n</italic> = 29) or sesame oil soft capsule as placebo (
 <italic>n</italic> = 35). Sesame oil was purchased from Golkaran Agro-Industry Co., Kashan, Iran, obtained from Iranian white sesame seeds. Chemical composition analysis of this sesame oil showed that it contains 75 to 80% of liquid fatty acids (oleic and linoleic acids), 15% of solid fatty acids (palmitic, stearic, and arachidic acids), and 1% of lecithin. In this way, one soft capsule was used orally three times a day for a period of 6 weeks. For randomization procedure, we used a random number table. Odd number was allocated to an intervention group and even number was allocated to the placebo group. The capsule box of both groups looked identical, so in addition to the physicians and researchers, the patients were also blinded to the drug allocation.
