<p>The cinnamaldehyde content of cinnamon oil was determined using a Shimadzu 10AD HPLC system (Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a column oven. Data integration was performed using Shimadzu Class-VP software. Separation was achieved using a Waters µBondpak C18 column (4.6 mm × 250 mm) and the column temperature was maintained at 30°C. The mobile phase comprising methanol (A) and 0.05% phosphoric acid (B) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min was used to elute the target components with a gradient program (0–5 min, 5%A; 5–10 min, 5%A to 35%A; 10–15 min, 35%A to 60%A; 15–18 min, 60%A to 80%A; 18–22 min, 80%A; 22–25 min, 80%A to 5%A, followed by 5 min equilibration between injections). The sample injection volume was 10 
 <italic>µ</italic>l and detection wavelength was set at 280 nm. The quantitation was by reference to a standard curve of cinnamaldehyde in sesame oil. Cinnamaldehyde was extracted from standards and samples using methanol in water by solvent extraction.
