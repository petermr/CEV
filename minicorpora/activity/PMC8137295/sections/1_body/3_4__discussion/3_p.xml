<p>The protective effect of cinnamon ethanolic extract against carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury in rats was investigated in 2012. Administration of ethanolic extract of cinnamon at different concentrations for 28 days can act as a potent hepatoprotective agent in poisoned rats, leading to a marked increase in the levels of catalase and superoxide dismutase enzymes and a decrease in the alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase [

 <italic>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic> compared to metocarbamol as a standard drug in white mice. Cinnamon aqueous extract showed better muscle relaxant effect than standard drug (metocarbamol, 60 mg/kg). This aqueous extract also showed fewer side effects compared to metocarbamol, which had less adverse effects attributed to its antioxidant properties [

Extracts that had increased 45 and 75% gallic acid equivalents of polyphenol content when administered to diabetic rat (200 mg per kg for 30 days) showed higher hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects than standard aqueous extract containing 15% gallic acid equivalents [

On the other hand, collagenase inhibitory activity in aqueous and alcoholic extracts was 25% and 30%, respectively, whereas in cinnamon essential oils it was maximum, 35%. Also, the antibacterial activity of cinnamon essential oil against all tested bacteria was significantly higher than the different cinnamon extracts [
