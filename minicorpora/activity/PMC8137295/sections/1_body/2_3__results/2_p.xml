<p>Patients were evaluated prior to and following 6 weeks in terms of the severity of vomiting, sickness, nausea, bloating, abdominal cramps, early satiety, acidic eructation/heartburn, loss of appetite, retrosternal discomfort, and epigastric pain/upper abdominal pain, as well as number of participants with any observed or reported adverse reaction. Symptom severity was assessed by a valid 5-point Likert scale: none (0), slight (1), moderate (2), severe (3), and very severe (4). The gastrointestinal symptom score (GIS) is used for the outcome measurement as a sum score, with its highest value of 40 points representing the most severe symptom intensity [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Based on the results, the GIS sum score showed nearly equal baseline values, with values of 20.72 and 21.94 for cinnamon oil and placebo groups, respectively (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In both groups, the GIS showed an improvement during 6 weeks (in the cinnamon oil group by 4.52 units, and in the placebo group by 7.19 units). The cinnamon oil and placebo groups significantly decreased the total dyspepsia score compared to the baseline at the endpoint (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). However, there was no significant difference between the cinnamon oil and placebo groups in terms of the baseline and endpoint values of the outcome variables (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.317 and 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.174, respectively) (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Moreover, the major symptoms analyzed in comparison of both groups are shown in 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. In all cases, the dyspepsia symptom score decrease compared to baseline was numerically greater in the placebo group than in the cinnamon oil group. As can be seen, the nausea score was decreased from baseline in the cinnamon oil group significantly compared to the placebo at the endpoint (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.012). However, the decreases of other dyspepsia symptoms scores from baseline in the cinnamon oil group were not significant compared to the placebo at the endpoint (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).
