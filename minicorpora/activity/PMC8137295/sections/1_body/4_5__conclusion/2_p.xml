<p>To our knowledge, this study is the first evaluating cinnamon oil effects in functional dyspepsia. However, the sample size was small and the experimental design was too simple without further analysis, which affects the reliability of this study. In addition, the short duration of patient follow-up was an important limitation of this study. Further studies are required to verify the efficacy and safety of the formula for symptom management on a larger scale, for a longer duration, and with different dosages.</p>
