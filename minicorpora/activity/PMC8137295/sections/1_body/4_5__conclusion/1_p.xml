<p>This study showed significant improvements in gastrointestinal symptom score in both treatment and placebo groups. The cinnamon oil and placebo groups significantly decreased the total dyspepsia score compared to the baseline at the endpoint (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). However, there was no significant difference between the cinnamon oil and placebo groups in terms of the baseline and endpoint values of the outcome variables (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.317 and 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.174, respectively). Of course, for the condition, functional dyspepsia is subjective symptomatic condition which is heavily affected by placebo.
