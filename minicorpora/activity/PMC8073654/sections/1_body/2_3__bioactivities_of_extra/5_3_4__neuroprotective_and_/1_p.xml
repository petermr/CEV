<p>In an assessment of the protective effect of the ethanol extract of 
 <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic> against LPS-induced neuronal cell loss and the activation of astrocytes in the hippocampus [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], pretreatment with 
 <italic>Z. cassumunar</italic> extract (200 mg/kg, i.p.) in adult male Wistar rats reduced neuronal cell loss in the hippocampus and suppressed the inflammatory response by reducing the expression of the glial fibrillary acidic protein and IL-1ss in the hippocampus. The constituents of Indonesian ginger, Bangle (
 <italic>Z. purpureum</italic>), demonstrated neurotrophic effects in a series of studies [

 <italic>Trans</italic>-3-(3′4′-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-[(E)-3′′,4′′-dimethoxystyryl]cyclohex-1-ene (
 <bold>11</bold>), and 
 <italic>cis</italic>-3-(3′4′-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-[(E)-3′′,4′′-dimethoxystyryl]cyclohex-1-ene (
 <bold>4</bold>) have exerted neurotrophic effects by inducing neurite sprouting in PC12 cells and triggering neurogenesis and neurite growth and protection in primary cultured rat cortical neurons. Chronic treatment of these compounds (50 mg/kg, p.o.) enhanced hippocampal neurogenesis in olfactory bulbectomy (OBX)-induced mice and increased the number of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU)/NeuN (a neuronal marker) double-labeled cells [

 <bold>48</bold>) and B (
 <bold>49</bold>), also promoted neurite outgrowth of nerve growth factor (NGF)-mediated PC12 cells in concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 μM [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-02377" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It was discovered that compound 
 <bold>48</bold> prevents β-sheet formation in the amyloid b-protein (Aβ42). Therefore, the above results indicate that phenylbutenoid dimers have therapeutic potential for treating depression and dementia, such as Alzheimer’s disease.
