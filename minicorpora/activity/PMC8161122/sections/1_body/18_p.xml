<p>In another study, the differences between two subspecies: 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> L. subsp. 
 <italic>hirtum</italic> (Link) Ietsw. (Greek oregano) and 
 <italic>Origanum</italic>
 <italic>vulgare</italic> L. subsp. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> (common oregano) growing in cultivation conditions within temperate climate of Central Europe were examined [
 <xref rid="B9-foods-10-01131" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Greek oregano was distinguished by visibly higher number of glandular trichomes on the leaves and higher content of essential oil, total phenolic acids and rosmarinic acid in comparison to common oregano. Variation in the content of essential oil and rosmarinic acid in different stages of plantâ€™s development was also observed. The results of this study revealed that Greek oregano could be successfully adapted to different climatic conditions keeping essential oils with a chemical profile typical of Mediterranean cultivars.
