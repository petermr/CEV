<p>Compared with olive oil, the chemical composition and potential beneficial effects of olive leaves are still poorly investigated. Taamalli et al. [
 <xref rid="B5-foods-10-01131" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] study the chemical composition of supercritical CO
 <sub>2</sub> extracts from fresh and dried olive leaves and their effect on hepatotoxicity caused by CCl
 <sub>4</sub> in a rat model. The authors identify and quantify 16 compounds (phenolic and terpenoid compounds) on the extracts being their composition significantly distinct. The in vivo study shows the hepatoprotective effect of both olive leaves extracts, due to significant improvement in hepatic fibrosis, biochemical parameters, and oxidative stress level after CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-induced liver damage.
