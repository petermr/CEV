<p>Plants are a source of secondary metabolites that can act as antileishmanicidal agents. An example of this is the family of alkamides, characteristic constituents of 
 <italic>Piper</italic> species that are widely used as culinary spices. (

 <italic>E</italic>)-demethoxypiplartine, two alkamides isolated from the leaves of 
 <italic>Piper pseudoarboreum</italic> Yunck. exhibit higher potency against 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> spp. promastigotes and against 
 <italic>Leishmania amazonensis</italic> amastigotes than the reference miltefosine. The activity of (
