<p>It is well-known that the profile of secondary metabolites varies depending on the morphological part of the plant. For species used in traditional medicine and gastronomy, it is imperative to know, in detail, the quantitative and qualitative composition of secondary metabolites in each morphological part. Only then will it be possible to take advantage of the potential of each part. Costa et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-foods-10-01131" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] study the leaves and rhizome of 
 <italic>Aglaomorpha quercifolia</italic> (L.) Hovenkamp &amp; S. Linds (this name is currently considered synonymous with the Latin binominal name 
 <italic>Drynaria quercifolia</italic> (L.) J.Sm.) used in Timor East in gastronomy and traditional medicine. The results show that the leaves are richest in fatty acids with high nutritional impact (ω6/ω3 ratio, atherogenicity index and thrombogenicity index), whereas the rhizome is richest in terpenes and steroids, some of them with proven medicinal properties.
