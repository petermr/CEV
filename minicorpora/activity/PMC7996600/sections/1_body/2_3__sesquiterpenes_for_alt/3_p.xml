<p>Huangaet al. [
 <xref rid="B139-biomolecules-11-00350" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>] studied the memory-enhancing property of the 
 <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> (Family-Ginkgoaceae) leaf extract. The chief constituent of the extract, bilobalide, a sesquiterpene trilactone, was found to deter the straight action of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. Dueto this property, the constituent tends to have a vibrant role in treating cognitive dysfunction in dementia. The bilobalide IC
 <sub>50</sub> (4.6 ± 0.5 μM) was reported as comparable to conventional antagonists of GABA receptors, picrotoxinin (2.4 ± 0.5 μM) and bicuculline (2.0 ± 0.1 μM) at α
 <sub>1</sub>β
 <sub>2</sub>γ
 <sub>2L</sub>GABA
 <sub>A</sub> receptors against GABA neurotransmitter. Bilobalide amplified the levels of GABA in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of mice; in addition, bilobalide also enhanced the neuronal excitability in hippocampus sites through the blockade of GABAergic neurotransmission, which is directly correlated with the learning and memory motions. The potency level of bilobalide decreased with increasing GABA concentrations indicating a module of competitive antagonism.
