<p>Sesquiterpenes are colorless, lipophilic terpenes found naturally in both plants and insects, holding a backbone of 15 carbons (M.F. = C
 <sub>15</sub>H
 <sub>24</sub>) with great structure diversity because of the unique and specific layering of various substituents and other functional groups around structural scaffolds [

Naturally, they occur as hydrocarbons or as oxygenated forms comprising the lactones, aldehydes, alcohols, acids, ketones, etc. Furthermore, sesquiterpenes also involve some essential oils and aromatic constituents with various pharmacological activities [
