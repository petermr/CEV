<p>Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEi) such as galantamine and rivastigmine mainly bind to the peripheral site in a competitive and reversible manner and spare the ACh at the synapse and thus help in the improvement of cholinergic transmission [

 <xref rid="B32-biomolecules-11-00350" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Rivastigmine can also hydrolyze the butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) present at glial cells of the temporal cortex region of the brain [

AChE inhibition can help in maintaining the normal neurotransmission mediated by ACh in a healthy brain and could prevent the occurrence or slow down the progression of AD. However, during the late stages of AD, the concentration of AChE decreases significantly (upto 45%) and BuChE is enhanced (upto 40–90%). Thus, ChEi, which are effective against both enzymes, are highly desirable in AD therapy [

Moreover, the reduction in substrate concentration (AChE) by these inhibitors may affect the Aβ plaque formation and thus justify the use of ChEi as multi-target therapy for AD. Current drugs available for the treatment of the disease if given timely, at their best may delay the related fatal alterations but are evidently incapable of reversing the neurodegeneration process associated.
