<p>Jung et al. [
 <xref rid="B86-biomolecules-11-00350" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] isolated the Valenc-1(10), 3(4),11,(12)-trien-2-one (
 <bold>4</bold>) from the heartwood extract of 
 <italic>Juniperus chinensis</italic> Linn. This compound exhibited significant butyrylcholinesterase activity with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 68 μM when compared to the positive control, berberine (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 19 μM), and this property might be attributed to its structural configuration where two double bonds at C
 <sub>1–10</sub> and C
 <sub>3–4</sub> and C
 <sub>11–12</sub>with a ketone group at C
 <sub>2</sub> are supposed to increase the inhibitory activity.
