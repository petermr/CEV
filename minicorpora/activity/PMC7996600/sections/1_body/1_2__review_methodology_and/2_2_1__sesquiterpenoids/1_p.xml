<p>Sesquiterpenoids are a group of various natural compounds and are the derivatives of a 15-C precursor called farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). Sesquiterpenoids are mainly confined to specialized secretory cells, laticifers, but when there is some biotic stress, and these can also be found in the vacuoles of other cells too. This diverse group is considered vital for the identity and protection of plants (response to allelopathic stimulation) and imparts various biological activities such as antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects [
