<p>The essential oils containing sesquiterpenoids in comparison to the oils containing monoterpenoids were found to be more effective inhibitors of AChE activity, and the same is the case of mixtures where it ruled by monoterpenoids showed weaker inhibition than the mixture dominated by sesquiterpenoids. Fujiwara et al. [
 <xref rid="B90-biomolecules-11-00350" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] evaluated the essential oil obtained from the bark of 
 <italic>Peltophorum dasyrachis</italic> Kurz ex Bakar and the main sesquiterpenoids found were, (+)(
 <italic>S</italic>)-ar-turmerone (
 <bold>9</bold>) and (+)-(
 <italic>S</italic>)-dihydro-ar-turmerone (
 <bold>10</bold>). These two isolated compounds have been assessed for their AChE inhibitory activity and proved to be potent in performing their action against AChE in a dose-dependent manner. Di hydro derivative of turmerone is most potent with IC
 <sub>50</sub> at 82 ± 0.2 μM, followed by volatile oil (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 83 ± 3 μg/mL). Hence, it was concluded from the study that the different compounds isolated from the 
 <italic>Peltophorum dasyrachis</italic> oil are effective and useful in the treatment of AD. Furthermore, the bisabolane-type sesquiterpenoid derivatives from plants, such as (+)-(7
 <italic>S</italic>,9
 <italic>S</italic>)-ar-turmerol, (+)-(7
 <italic>S</italic>,9
 <italic>R</italic>)-ar-turmerol, (+)-(7
 <italic>S</italic>,9
 <italic>S</italic>)-dihydro-ar-turmerol, (+)-(7
 <italic>S</italic>,9
 <italic>R</italic>)-dihydro-ar-turmerol, (+)-(
 <italic>S</italic>)-ar-curcumene, and (+)-(
 <italic>S</italic>)-dihydro-ar-curcumene, were synthesized which were found to exhibit the acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity in the order hydrocarbons &lt;alcohols &lt; ketones. The maximum activity was observed through the oxidation of the functional group at C
 <sub>9</sub> position and C
 <sub>10</sub>–C
 <sub>11</sub> structure of single-bond moiety, (+)-(
 <italic>S</italic>)-dihydro-ar-turmerone. Moreover, the Turmerone was analyzed to be a competitive inhibitor of AChE, whereas the dihydro derivative is the non-competitive inhibitor of this enzyme. Miyazawa et al. [
 <xref rid="B91-biomolecules-11-00350" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>] investigated the leaf and stem oil of 
 <italic>Gynura bicolor</italic> DC for AChE inhibitory potential. The leaf oil inhibited the AChE with IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 85 µg/mL), On the other hand, stem oil showed the same inhibition with IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 92 μg/mL. It indicated the leaf oil as a stronger inhibitor of AChE activity than the stem oil. GC–MS analysis confirmed the presence of (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-caryophyllene (31%) and bicycle germacrene (8%) as the major sesquiterpenoids from the 
 <italic>Gynura bicolor</italic> DC leaves oil. The sesquiterpenoids in essential oil from the 
 <italic>Gynura bicolor</italic> were found to act synergistically against AChE inhibition. Christianahet al. [
 <xref rid="B92-biomolecules-11-00350" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>] extracted the volatile oil from the leaves of 
 <italic>Plectranthus aegyptiacus</italic> (Forssk.) and identified thirty compounds including some sesquiterpenoids such as copaene, α-caryophyllen, germacrene-
 <sc>d</sc>, and α-cadinol with a respective concentration of 5%, 6%, 12%, and 8%. The oil was observed to exhibit AChE inhibitory activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 8 ± 0.6 mg/mL, which can be helpful in the treatment of AD.
