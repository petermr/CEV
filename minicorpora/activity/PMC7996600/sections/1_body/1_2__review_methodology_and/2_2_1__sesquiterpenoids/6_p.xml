<p>Moreover, Shi et al. [
 <xref rid="B89-biomolecules-11-00350" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>] extracted some bioactive sesquiterpenes, oxyphyllanene A, teuhetenone A, oxyphyllol B, and nootkatone from the chloroform extract of 
 <italic>Alpinia oxyphylla</italic> fruits and evaluated for their cognitive potential. Long term exposure to chloroform extract improved the cognitive abilities while performing the behavioral tasks, increased the glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px) activities, decreased the acetylcholinesterase (AChE), malondialdehyde level (MDA), and β-amyloid (Aβ), and ultimately overturned the microglia activation, neuronal acidophilia degeneration, and cortex and hippocampus nuclear condensation. It was concluded that the 
 <italic>Alpinia oxyphylla</italic> ameliorates the learning and memory deficits by attenuating the oxidative stress, regulating the activation of the microglia, and degeneration of the neuronal acidophilia to reinforce the cholinergic functions. Thus, the bioactive sesquiterpenes isolated from the chloroform extract of 
 <italic>Alpinia oxyphylla</italic> may provide some therapeutic targets for the prevention and cure of AD. In addition, the ethanolic extracts of this plant have shown agood inhibitory activity of 44.49% against AChE at 0.1 mg/mL concentration.
