 <italic>Inula oculus-christi</italic> and 
 <italic>I. aucheriana</italic> (Family-Compositae) and evaluated their capability of inhibiting AChE activity by using the Ellman assay method. It was observed that out of the three evaluated compounds, the Gaillardin (
 <bold>36</bold>) was the most versatile secondary metabolites (IC
 <sub>50</sub> for AChE 729 Î¼M) present in the plants and can be investigated for further AD studies.
