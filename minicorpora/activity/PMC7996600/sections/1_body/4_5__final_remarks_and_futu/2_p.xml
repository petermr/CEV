<p>Critically analyzing the literature, it has been found that 12 compounds out of total 58 sesquiterpenes were reported to possess IC

 <sub>50</sub> (for AChE) should not be the criteria for the selection of a compound for anti-Alzheimer potential. Because the evaluation of cholinesterase inhibition potential of compounds, with carbonyl group, by in vitro methods such as Ellman reagent could produce the false positive [
