<p>Furthermore, it has been established that for the proper functioning of neurons, there should be a critical balance between the excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters [

 <xref rid="B158-biomolecules-11-00350" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. It is evident that β-amyloid (Aβ) could also enhance the translation of GABA
 <sub>A</sub> receptor (at α
 <sub>6</sub> subunit) by the phosphorylation of mTOR and ERK in the cerebellum of experimental mice [

 <xref rid="B160-biomolecules-11-00350" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>], and hence an increase in inhibitory transmission at synapse affects the learning and memory process [

 <sub>21</sub> subunits of GABA
 <sub>A</sub> receptors that enhanced the excitability of neurons in hippocampal slices [
