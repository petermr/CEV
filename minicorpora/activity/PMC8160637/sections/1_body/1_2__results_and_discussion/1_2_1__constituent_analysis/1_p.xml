<p>A schematic illustration of constituent analysis and behavioral evaluations of

 <italic>C. osmophloeum</italic> leaf oil was linalool (93.2%), followed by coumarin (2.3%), camphor (1.5%), Î²-caryophyllene (1.2%), 
 <italic>trans</italic>-cinnamaldehyde (1.0%), and caryophyllene oxide (0.8%) (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03037-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The content of the major compound, linalool, was more than 90%; it revealed that the quality and stability of leaf oils from 
 <italic>C. osmophloeum</italic> ct. linalool are consistent.
