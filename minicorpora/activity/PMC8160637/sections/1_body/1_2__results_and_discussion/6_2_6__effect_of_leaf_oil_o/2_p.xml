<p>The results of the primidone-induced sleeping test is listed in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03037-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>; the duration (sleeping time) of the control mice was 55.08 ± 4.72 min. The mice treated with leaf oil at 100 mg/kg showed a slight reduction in the sleeping time (49.91 ± 4.59 min) compared to the control, but the data of both groups were not statistically significant. The durations of the other treated mice were all lower than that of the control group, indicating that no hypnotic activity was observed for leaf oil in the primidone-induced sleeping test in none of the examined doses. Some antidepressant medicines would cause drowsiness to different extents in patients. Results from the hypnotic evaluation revealed that
