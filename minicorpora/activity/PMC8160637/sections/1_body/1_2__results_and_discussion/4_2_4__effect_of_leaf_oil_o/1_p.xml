<p>The forced swimming test is the typical and representative assay used to evaluate the antidepressant activity in rodent animals. Mahmoudi et al. (2015) reported that 
 <italic>Feijoa sellowiana</italic> leaf extract showed the antidepressant activity in the forced swimming assay; leaf extract treatment remarkably decreased the immobility time of the male Swiss albino mice [

Shorter immobility time means the treated mice exhibit more vigorous and active behaviors instead of depressive symptoms in the stress environment. The immobility behavior of mice in the forced swimming test was reduced by the administration of 
 <italic>Turnera diffusa</italic> aqueous extract; results confirmed the antidepressant effect of 
 <italic>T. diffusa</italic> aqueous extract [
