 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03037-f003">Figure 3</xref> shows the immobility time of the examined mice in the forced swimming test: the latency of control group mice was 109.50 ± 7.13 s. The immobility time of the mice treated with trazodone hydrochloride, a prescription antidepressant, was significantly shorter (39.75 ± 3.69 s) than that of control mice at the dose of 100 mg/kg. The leaf oil also induced the considerable reduction in immobility time compared with the vehicle control, with a statistical difference (
