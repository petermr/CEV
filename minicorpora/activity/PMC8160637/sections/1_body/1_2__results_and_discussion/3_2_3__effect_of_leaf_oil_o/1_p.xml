 <xref rid="molecules-26-03037-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows the effect of leaf oil on antianxiety activity in mice by the open field assay. The number of entries in the central zone of the control mice was 18.00 ± 4.47, which was much lower than that of the mice treated with trazodone hydrochloride at a dose of 100 mg/Kg (31.14 ± 3.76). It revealed that the treatment of trazodone hydrochloride resulted in the mice more frequently entering the central zone instead of staying in the peripheral zone in the open field test box. No significant difference in the number of entries into the central zone were found between control mice and the mice treated with leaf oil at a low dose (100 mg/kg). The number of entries into the central zone of the mice treated with the dose (400 mg/kg) of leaf oil was 31.00 ± 3.87, indicating that the antianxiety activity of leaf oil treatment was comparable with that of the positive control, trazodone hydrochloride, (

The result indicated the leaf oil has an anxiolytic effect in mice, and it is consistent with the previous studies performed by Linck et al. (2010) [
