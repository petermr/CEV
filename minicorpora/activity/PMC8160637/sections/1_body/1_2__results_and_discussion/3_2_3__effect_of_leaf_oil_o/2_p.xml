<p>The total distance traveled in the open filed test was also calculated to identify the locomotor activity level of the test mice after different treatments, as shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03037-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The control mice and the mice treated with leaf oil at a low dose (100 mg/kg) showed a similar performance: the total distance traveled of both groups were 21.28 ± 3.87 and 21.58 ± 2.88 m, respectively. The significant improvement of the total distance traveled was observed in the other three groups (

The mice treated with trazodone hydrochloride (100 mg/kg) travelled the longest distance, which demonstrated the superior locomotor activity. The higher dose of leaf oil (200 and 400 mg/kg) produced a significant increase in the total distance traveled compared to that of the control mice, it reflects that the locomotor activity level of mice was enhanced after treatment with the high-dose leaf oil.
