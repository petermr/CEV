<p>Motor coordination activity was evaluated by the rotarod assay, as depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03037-f004">Figure 4</xref>. The duration time of the control mice remained on the rotating rod was 192.40 ± 19.03 s. There was no significant difference in latency to falling in rotarod between the control mice and the mice treated with the low dose of leaf oil (100 mg/kg). The mice treated with the higher doses of leaf oil (200 and 400 mg/kg) showed a large increase in the time spent on the rotating rod, as compared with the positive control, trazodone hydrochloride, at the dose of 100 mg/kg (
