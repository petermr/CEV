<p>Muthaiyah et al. (2014) reported that dietary walnuts can effectively improve the psychomotor coordination in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimerâ€™s disease; it suggested dietary supplementation of natural products is of benefit to enhance the motor coordination skill [

(2013) investigated the motor coordination effect of geraniol, an acyclic monoterpene alcohol; the results displayed that geraniol exhibited the neuroprotective effect to alleviate the chemically induced neurotoxicity and improve the motor coordination of treated mice in the rotarod assay [
