<p>The body weight of the ICR mice was measured every week during the experimental period. The initial and final body weights of all mice, including the control, positive control (trazodone hydrochloride), and treatment with three doses (100, 200, and 400 mg/Kg) of leaf oil, were in the normal ranges, as shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03037-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The body weight gains of the control and positive control mice increased 7.6 ± 2.1 g and 7.1 ± 1.1 g after 6 weeks. The body weight gains of the mice treated with three doses of leaf oil (LO100, LO200, and LO400) were 8.2 ± 1.9 g, 6.8 ± 2.1 g, and 7.6 ± 2.1 g, respectively, with no significant difference between all groups in the statistical analysis. It reveals that
