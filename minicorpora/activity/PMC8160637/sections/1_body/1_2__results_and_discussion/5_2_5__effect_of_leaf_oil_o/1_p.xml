<p>Tail flicking in rodents is a response of pain caused by the heat stimulus to measure the efficacy of antinociceptive activity. The results of the tail flick test are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03037-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>; the tail flick time of control mice was 3.75 ± 0.38 s. The mice treated with trazodone hydrochloride exhibited a slight decrease in the tail flick time (3.49 ± 0.32 s) without statistical significance (

The results indicated that both the leaf oil and trazodone hydrochloride did not exhibit the antinociceptive activity for the experimental mice.
