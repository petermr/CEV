A video camera was used to record each experimental process for 6 min, and immobility time was defined as the time the mouse spent floating in the open cylinder without struggling and slightly treading to keep the head above water during the final 4 min of the test. The decrease in immobility time indicates the antidepressant-like behavior of treated mice.
