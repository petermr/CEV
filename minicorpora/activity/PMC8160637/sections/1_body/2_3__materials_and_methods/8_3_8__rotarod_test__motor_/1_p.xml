<p>Motor coordination activity was evaluated by the rotarod apparatus (LE8205, Panlab, 5 slots) consisting of rotating rods (3 cm in diameter). Referring to the related reports [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-26-03037" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-26-03037" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-26-03037" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], all mice were pre-trained once for 5 min one day before the formal testing. After administering the specimens for 1 h, the mice were placed in the rotarod, and the apparatus would automatically record the latency (duration of time spent on the rotating rod) when each mouse fell from the rod rotating at 10 rpm in a 5-min test session. The longer latency time indicates the better motor coordination ability of the examined mice.
