<p>The open field test is a classic assay used to evaluate the anxiety and locomotor activities in mice. One hour after oral administration, the mice were placed in the central zone of an open box (60 (L) × 60 (W) × 40 (H) cm). The bottom area of the test box is divided into 16 square blocks, the middle 4 blocks is the central zone, the peripheral zone is 12 outer blocks. When the mouse enters the new environment, the mouse will spontaneously approach the outer perimeter near the wall area. A digital imaging system was used to analyze the number of entries in the central zone (antianxiety effect) and total travel distance (locomotor activity) during the 5 min of the test period [
