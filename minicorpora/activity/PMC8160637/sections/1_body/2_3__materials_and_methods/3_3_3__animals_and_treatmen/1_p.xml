<p>Adults male ICR mice (weighing 30–38 g) were housed under constant room temperature (22–25 °C) and inverted light–dark cycle (12:12 h) with free access to water and food ad libitum. The mice were allowed to adapt to the laboratory environment for 1 week and were randomly divided into five groups (
 <italic>n</italic> = 7). The leaf oil (LO) was evenly mixed in soybean oil, and was administered daily by oral route (p.o.) via gavage to the animals at doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg, respectively, using soybean oil as the vehicle (control, soybean oil). The positive control was trazodone hydrochloride (TH, 100 mg/kg), a prescription antidepressant approved by the FDA. Leaf oil and trazodone hydrochloride were administered each day over the whole experimental period. The body weight of each mouse was recorded once a week. After 2 weeks of treatment with leaf oil, behavioral tests were performed between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. All behavioral protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) in National Taiwan University (IACUC Approval No: NTU105-EL-00088), and all mice were handled by the 3R principles of laboratory animal care and use.
