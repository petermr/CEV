<p>The chemical constituents in leaf oils was analyzed by using the gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS, GCMS-QP2010 Ultra, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a DB-5MS capillary column (Crossbond 5% phenyl methylpolysiloxane, 30 m length × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 µm film thickness, J&amp;W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA). The temperature of the injection port was set at 250 °C. The oven temperature was initially held at 60 °C for 3 min, then increased to 150 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min, and finally increased to 240 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min and held for 5 min. The carrier gas was helium at a flow rate of 1 mL/min, the split ratio was 1:10, and the GC/MS interface temperatures were set at 250 °C. Constituents were identified by comparing mass spectra (m/z 50–650 amu) with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Wiley library databases, the arithmetic index (AI) [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-03037" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and authentic standards of constituents. The quantification of constituents was obtained by integrating the peak area of the chromatogram by GC coupled to a flame ionization detector (FID).
