 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-03037" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], the primidone-induced sleeping test was conducted to evaluate the hypnotic effect of 
 <italic>C. osmophloeum</italic> ct. linalool leaf oil in mice. After the oral administration of each treatment for 1 h, primidone (an analog of phenobarbital) was injected into mice at a dose of 30 mg/kg (intraperitoneal injection, i.p.) to induce sleep. The duration of sleep of each mouse was recorded; the longer duration indicates the better hypnotic effect of the treatment.
