<p>Previous scientific findings reported that linalool, a common monoterpene present in many aromatic plant essential oils, possesses antianxiety activity, a positive effect on social interaction, and a reduction in aggressive behaviors [

 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-03037" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Rare research has mentioned the antidepressant activity of linalool, and no paper has investigated the motor coordination activity and the other behavioral effects of linalool. Therefore, the aims of this study were to analyze the chemical constituents of 
 <italic>C. osmophloeum</italic> ct. linalool leaf oil, and to validate its antianxiety activity, locomotor activity, antidepressant effect, antinociceptive activity, hypnotic effect, and motor coordination activity in mice by rodent behavioral assays. It is expected to confirm the antianxiety activity of 
 <italic>C. osmophloeum</italic> ct. linalool leaf oil, and firstly evaluate the antidepressant effect, motor coordination activity and other bioactive properties.
