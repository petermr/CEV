<p>The study demonstrated the behavioral effects of 
 <italic>C. osmophloeum</italic> ct. linalool leaf oil after oral administration in mice, the motor coordination and antidepressant activities of leaf oil were firstly reported by a rodent model system, to the best of our knowledge. In the open field test, the oral treatment on mice with leaf oil also increased the number of entries in the central zone and total travel distance; it provided evidence that the leaf oil exhibited anxiolytic and locomotor activities. The oral treatment on mice with leaf oil decreased the immobility time and induced the antidepressant effect in the forced swimming test. The motor coordination activity of mice was improved after the administration of leaf oil, and the time spent on the rotating rod of the treated mice was significantly increased in the rotarod assay. These results revealed that the 
 <italic>C. osmophloeum</italic> ct. linalool leaf oil has antidepressant and anxiolytic activities, enhances the locomotor and motor coordination effects, and has the promising potential to be a therapeutic supplement of minor/medium depressive syndromes.
