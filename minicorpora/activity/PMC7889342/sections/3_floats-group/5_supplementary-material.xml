  <p>Supplementary Figure S1: antioxidant effects of 
   <italic>T. daenensis</italic> essential oils base on DPPH assay. A fresh DPPH stock was performed and 2 milliliters of it was added to different concentrations of each compound (0–400 
   <italic>μ</italic>M) and placed in the dark for 30 min. Using ((control absorbance–sample absorbance) × 100/control absorbance) equation, scavenging capacity percentage was determined, where controls contained all reagents except the antioxidant factors. An essential oils concentration required for scavenge 50% of DPPH radicals is known as scavenging capacity-50 (SC50). Scavenging capacity-50 was calculated from the calibration curve determined by linear or nonlinear regression from the scavenging capacity percentage versus essential oils concentrations. Supplementary Figure S2: antioxidant effects of 
   <italic>T. daenensis</italic> essential oils base on 
   <italic>β</italic>-carotene bleaching assay. Bleaching assay was carried utilizing a 
   <italic>β</italic>-carotene/linoleic acid emulsion technique. Briefly, 1 mg 
   <italic>β</italic>-carotene, 40 mg of linoleic acid, and 200 mg of Tween-20 were homogenized in 2 ml of chloroform. Then, chloroform was rotary-evaporated at 40°C for 30 min and then 100 ml of oxygenated deionized water was combined with vigorous shaking to form a stable emulsion. Then, 2.5 ml of the emulsion was added to 350 
   <italic>μ</italic>l of different essential oils concentrations (0–400 
   <italic>μ</italic>M) and left at 50°C in the light for 2 h and optical density was monitored at 470 nm. Bleaching inhibition potential percentage was determined by [(sample absorbance at time 0 – sample absorbance after 2 h)  × 100/(control absorbance at time 0 – control absorbance after 2 h)] equation. Bleaching inhibitory capacity-50 (BIC50) is a concentration required for protection of half percentage of 
   <italic>β</italic>-carotene molecules from bleaching and is calculated from the calibration curve determined by linear or nonlinear regression from the bleaching inhibition percentages versus alkaloid concentrations, where controls contained all reagents except the antioxidant factors. Supplementary Figure S3: the induced DNA damage by the 
   <italic>T. daenensis</italic> essential oils was evaluated on lymphocytes cells by the COMET assay conducted under alkaline conditions. A serial dilution of each essential oil (0 to 600 
   <italic>μ</italic>M) was supplemented with 120 
   <italic>μ</italic> M H
   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>2</sub> and stored for 5 min at room temperature. Then, 10000 cells were transferred to each dilution and the suspension was stored at 4°C for 30 min. Cells were harvested and sandwiched between two layers low-melting agarose on a slide. Cells were lysed and electrophoresed. Finally, DNA was stained with ethidium bromide and pictured using a fluorescent microscope (BX51; Tokyo, Japan). Representative COMET images are shown from (A) PBS (negative COMET), (B) H
   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>2</sub>-treated TD 9 TD 10 cells (positive COMET), and (C–H) simultaneous treatment with different concentration (0.01–5 mg/ml) for 30 min.
