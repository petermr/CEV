<p>EOs of 
 <italic>O. onites</italic> (OOEO) and 
 <italic>S. thymbra</italic> (STEO) were formulated using diverse nanovesicles. Firstly, OOEO was encapsulated in conventional liposomes using PBS as dispersant medium and phosphatidylcholine (P90G) plus cholesterol in different ratios, trying to optimize average diameter and polydispersity of the vesicles. An amount of 10 mg/mL of OOEO was found to be the optimal concentration to obtain stable formulations without OOEO extrusion from the system, but vesicles resulted not homogeneous. Accordingly, other types of vesicles were approached, in particular those obtained by mixing membrane components with a water-soluble, non-volatile organic solvent, such as a polyol. The resulting nanovesicles are physiologically suitable even when administered intravenously into the human body. In particular, both glycerol and propylene glycol are among the most widely used raw materials in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. Glycerol shows excellent solubility in water, and, due to its GRAS status, it is very safe to use [

 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-02124" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Different experimental conditions were tested, as reported in the experimental section. Finally, the lipid film was constituted of P90G (600 mg) plus cholesterol (10 mg). It was hydrated using a 5% 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic> glycerol/water solution, and OOEO (10 mg/mL) or STEO (10 mg/mL) or OOEO plus STEO (5 mg/mL plus 5 mg/mL), were added in this step, obtaining 
 <italic>O. onites</italic> essential oil-loaded glycerosomes (OO-GS), 
 <italic>S. thymbra</italic> essential oil-loaded glycerosomes (ST-GS) and 
 <italic>O. onites</italic> plus 
 <italic>S. thymbra</italic> essential oil-loaded glycerosomes (OOST-GS). In parallel, different nanovesicles were prepared hydrating the lipid film with a 1% 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic> propylene glycol/water solution and obtaining propylene glycol-nanovesicles (PGV) loaded with: 
 <italic>O. onites</italic> essential oil (OO-PGV), 
 <italic>S. thymbra</italic> essential oil (ST-PGV) and 
 <italic>O. onites</italic> plus 
 <italic>S. thymbra</italic> essential oil (OOST-PGV). All the samples were analyzed by light scattering techniques and they showed small dimensions, low polydispersity index (PdI) and good Î¶-potential (

 <xref rid="molecules-26-02124-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The higher standard deviation related to the average sizes of OO-GS and OO-PGV indicates a lower repeatability of sample preparation. However, the application of nanovesicles in food products is not limited by their average dimensions and all the developed formulations have suitable physical characteristics as delivery systems of food preservatives.
