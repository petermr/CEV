<p>The combination of mechanic stirrer and ultrasonic bath during the two hydration processes allowed to obtain homogenous and stable formulations, without any further optimization step. Glycerosomes and PG-nanovesicles loaded with OOEO plus STEO were analyzed by transmission electron microscope (TEM,
