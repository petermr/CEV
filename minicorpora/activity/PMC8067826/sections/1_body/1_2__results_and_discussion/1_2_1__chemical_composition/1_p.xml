<p>The yield (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>) of the EO obtained from 
 <italic>O. onites</italic> (OOEO) was 3.0%. Overall, thirty-five compounds, representing 100.0% of the OOEO, were identified. In particular, the main components were carvacrol (66.0%), 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (7.9%), γ-terpinene (4.9%) and borneol (2.8%). Furthermore, reasonable levels of β-bisabolene (2.3%), myrcene (2.1%), α-terpinene (2.0%) and terpinen-4-ol (1.7%) were also detected, while α-pinene and thymol were found in low percentages (both 1.0%) (

 <italic>O. onites</italic>, originated from different parts of Greece, underlying the high yields of EOs from south-eastern islands (Halki, Symi and Tilos) [

 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-02124" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], our studied OOEO revealed a carvacrol chemotype. We should point out that linalool was determined in a low amount (0.4%). Previous studies discussed the distinction among the 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>hirtum</italic> and 
 <italic>O. onites</italic>, mentioning that the EO of the latter species is poor in thymol and/or 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, whereas its borneol content ranges more than 2.0% [

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-02124" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Our findings comply with this distinction since thymol concentration was low (1.0%) and borneol was found in higher level (2.8%).
