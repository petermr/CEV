 <xref rid="molecules-26-02124-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These constituents were grouped into oxygenated monoterpenes (50.0%), monoterpene hydrocarbons (41.9%), sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (7.7%), oxygenated sesquiterpenes (0.2%) and aliphatic alcohols (0.1%) (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02124-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Precisely, the main compounds were carvacrol (46.0%), γ-terpinene (19.7%), 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (7.6%), β-caryophyllene (7.0%) and α-terpinene (5.1%). Other constituents in lower concentrations were myrcene (2.5%), α-thujene (2.4%), α-pinene (1.6%) and linalool (1.3%). Our results are in accordance with previous studies in EO of
