<p>Comparing the two investigated EOs, carvacrol was the dominant component, while thymol was detected in very low concentrations (&lt;1.0%) in both samples. We also observed that the high carvacrol (66.0%) content was related to low amount of γ-terpinene (4.9%) in the EO of 
 <italic>O. onites</italic>, whereas the EO of 
 <italic>S. thymbra</italic> demonstrated a relatively lower concentration of carvacrol (46.0%) followed by a high content of γ-terpinene (19.7%). This observation is congruous with a previous study [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-02124" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and could be attributed to biosynthetic pathways, considering that γ-terpinene and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene are biosynthetic precursors of carvacrol. In addition, the two samples presented similar chemical groups. Both plants were rich in EOs which is directly related to the distinct environmental and geographical conditions of Symi island which belongs to the Dodecanese island complex (SE Aegean region).
