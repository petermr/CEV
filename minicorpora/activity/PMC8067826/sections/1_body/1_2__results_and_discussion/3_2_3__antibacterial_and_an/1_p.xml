<p>Results of the evaluation of antibacterial and antifungal activity of pure and formulated OOEO/STEO are reported in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02124-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02124-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>. All tested samples possessed significant antimicrobial effects. The best antimicrobial activities of formulated OOEO/STEO against all tested bacteria and fungi were observed for OO-PGV. The antibacterial minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of OO-PGV ranged from 1.00 to 4.00 mg vesicles/mL, while the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were within the range of 2.00 to 8.00 mg vesicles/mL. MIC and MBC of essential oils formulated in nanovesicles, reported in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02124-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, were calculated taking into account that the amounts of EOs loaded in the nanovesicles were 10 mg EO/g of vesicles. The pure OOEO exhibited stronger antibacterial potential with MICs at 0.0002–0.002 mg/mL and MBCs at 0.0003–0.0025 mg/mL compared to standard antibiotic Streptomycin and formulated OOEO used as reference compounds. The most sensitive bacterial species was 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, while 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> was the resistant one among all the tested bacteria. MIC and MFC were reported in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02124-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>: for OOEO, MICs were in the range 0.0002–0.001 mg/mL against all tested fungi, and MFCs varied within the range of 0.0003–0.0012 mg/mL. Antifungal potential of OOEO was higher than that of formulated OOEO and reference drug Ketoconazole. The most sensitive fungus appeared to be 
 <italic>P. verrucosum</italic>, while both 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species were found to be resistant. In conclusion, the activity of both pure OOEO and STEO was more prominent when compared to the activity of corresponding amounts of formulated EOs. However, this lower antibacterial and antifungal effectiveness of formulated EOs with respect to pure EOs is mainly due to the prolonged release properties of the EOs loaded in the nanovesicles, as described by other studies on in vitro activity of essential oils formulated in glycerosomes and liposomes [
