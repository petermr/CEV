<p>The cytotoxic effect of pure and formulated OOEO/STEO (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02124-t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>) was assessed on the HaCaT cell line, a spontaneously transformed aneuploid immortal keratinocyte cell line from adult human skin, a very sensible cell line used as an effective in vitro alternative for an initial orientating screening of safety issues of substances. Blank-GS and Blank-PGV samples showed no toxicity towards HaCaT up to 500 µg/mL, which is indicative of carrier low cytotoxicity. All the investigated samples showed to be weakly cytotoxic towards this cell line. The results showed that OO-GS sample showed the highest cytotoxic effect on the human immortalized keratinocytes, followed by OOST-GS (combination of essential oils loaded in glycerosomes). OO-PGV (propylene glycol-nanovesicles loaded with 
 <italic>O. onites</italic> essential oil) was the only sample with a cytotoxic effect below 500 µg/mL. Although weak cytotoxicity could be acknowledged for some samples, further application of propylene glycol-nanovesicles should be considered when formulating antimicrobial preparations, since this carrier expressed no toxicity to immortalized cell line. These safety data are encouraging for further safety studies to demonstrate the safe use of the developed nanovesicles.
