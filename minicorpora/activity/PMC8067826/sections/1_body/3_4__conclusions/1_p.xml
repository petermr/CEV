<p>During recent years, synthetic preservatives are generally used to protect food against microorganisms. However, there is an urgent need to search new antimicrobials because of the increasing resistance against these microorganisms. EOs represent a valid alternative to synthetic preservatives in the food industry, and 
 <italic>Origanum</italic> essential oil has been largely investigated as antimicrobial and antioxidant additive in food products [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-26-02124" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. However, in many cases their organoleptic impact in foodstuffs limits their usage. Techniques such as nanoencapsulation can address this problem. Thus, this study was designed in order to develop propylene glycol-nanovesicles loaded with EOs from 
 <italic>O. onites</italic> and 
 <italic>S. thymbra</italic> for the first time and to evaluate them as safe and food-grade delivery systems.
