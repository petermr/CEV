<p>In this study, the chemical profiles of the EOs of 
 <italic>O. onites</italic> and 
 <italic>S. thymbra</italic> were identified. Oxygenated monoterpenes comprised the major chemical class in both EOs. In particular, the main components of 
 <italic>O. onites</italic> EO were carvacrol (66.0%), 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (7.9%), γ-terpinene (4.9%) and borneol (2.8%). Whereas, the principal compounds of 
 <italic>S. thymbra</italic> EO were carvacrol (46.0%), γ-terpinene (19.7%), 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (7.6%), β-caryophyllene (7.0%) and α-terpinene (5.1%). Afterwards, we succeeded to encapsulate the EOs in nanovesicles, which presented high homogeneity and optimal encapsulation efficiency either for 
 <italic>O. onites</italic> or 
 <italic>S. thymbra</italic>. Both pure EOs and formulated EOs were evaluated against different food-borne pathogens. The high antimicrobial activity of both EOs could be attributed to their chemical constituents, not only to the high concentration of carvacrol but also to the potential synergy of all the compounds. Our results showed that pure EOs were more active compared to the corresponding amounts of formulated EOs. We should point out that the lower antibacterial and anti-fungal effectiveness of formulated EOs with respect to pure EOs is assigned mainly to the prolonged release properties of the EOs loaded in the nanovesicles. Cytotoxicity was also tested in HaCaT cells.
