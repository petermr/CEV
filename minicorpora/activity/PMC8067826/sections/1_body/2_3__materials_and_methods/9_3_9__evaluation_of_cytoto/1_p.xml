<p>Crystal violet assay was used for determination of the antiproliferative effect, according to the previous protocol [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-26-02124" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] with modifications. Antiproliferative effect of pure and formulated OOEO/STEO was analyzed on spontaneously immortalized human skin keratinocytes (HaCaT) cell line. Cell line was grown in high-glucose Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Twenty-four hours before treatment with the extract 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well were seeded in a 96-well plate. After, the medium was removed, fresh medium supplemented with different concentrations of the extract and compound (6.25–400 μg/mL) dissolved in phosphate buffered saline was added to the cells. Control cells were grown in medium. Potassium dichromate (K
 <sub>2</sub>Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>) was used as a positive control and PBS as negative control. The experiment was performed in triplicate for each condition and cells were incubated with the extract for 24 h. After that period, the medium was removed and the cells were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), stained with 0.5% crystal violet staining solution and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Afterwards, crystal violet was removed, the cells were washed in a stream of tap water and left to air-dry at room temperature for 24 h. The absorbance of dye dissolved in methanol was measured in a microplate reader at 590 nm (OD590). The results were expressed as IC
 <sub>50</sub> (%) value in μg/mL. The criterion used to categorize the cytotoxic activity of pure and formulated OOEO/STEO to cancer cell lines was as follows: IC
 <sub>50</sub> ≤ 20 µg/mL = highly cytotoxic, IC
 <sub>50</sub> ranged between 21 and 250 µg/mL = moderately cytotoxic, IC
 <sub>50</sub> ranged between 201 and 500 µg/mL = weakly cytotoxic, and IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 501 µg/mL = no cytotoxicity. All analyses were performed in triplicate; each replicate was quantified also three times. Data were expressed as mean standard deviation, where applicable. In the cases where statistical significance differences were identified, the dependent variables were compared using Tukey’s honestly significant difference (HSD) test.
