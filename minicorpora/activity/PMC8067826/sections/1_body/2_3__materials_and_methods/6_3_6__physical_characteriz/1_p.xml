<p>Average hydrodynamic diameter (nm), polydispersity index (PdI) and ζ-potential (mV) of the developed nanovesicles were measured by Dynamic and Electrophoretic Light Scattering, DLS/ELS (Zetasizer Nanoseries ZS90) by Malvern instrument (Worcestershire, UK), at 25 °C, with a scattering angle of 90 °C [

 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-02124" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Glycerosomes and PG-nanovesicles loaded with the essential oils were diluted with ultrapure water before measurements, in order to achieve a suitable scattering intensity. Successively, the two systems loaded with OOEO plus STEO were observed by transmission electron microscope, TEM (CM12 TEM, PHILIPS, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) equipped with an OLYMPUS Megaview G2 camera, with an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. A drop of sample, 5-folds diluted in water, was applied and dried by desiccation on a carbon film copper grid and it was counterstained with 1%
