<p>Quantitative analyses of OOEO and STEO in nanovesicles was based on the determination of carvacrol, the most abundant and marker constituent of both essential oils. Analyses were carried out using a 1100 High Performance Liquid Chromatograph (HPLC) equipped with a diode array detector (DAD), by Agilent Technologies Italia Spa (Rome, Italy). The chromatographic analyses were performed using a reverse-phase column Luna C-18 100 Å (250 × 4.6) mm, 5 µm particle size, maintained at 25 °C; and the chromatograms were acquired at 276 nm [

A gradient elution method, with 1 mL/min flow rate, was applied, using (A) acetonitrile and (B) formic acid/water (pH 3.2) as mobile phases. The analytical method was: 0–3 min 30–30% (B), 3–10 min 30–80% (B), 10–15 min 80–80% (B), 15–20 min 80–95% (B), 20–22 min 95–95% (B), 22–27 min 95–30%. The calibration curve was prepared using a 0.001 μL/μL standard solution of carvacrol in methanol and successive dilutions. The coefficient of determination (R
 <sup>2</sup>) of carvacrol calibration curve was 0.9999.
