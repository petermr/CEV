<p>Air-dried parts (40.0 g) of each plant were cut into small pieces and subjected separately to hydrodistillation for 2 h, using a modified Clevenger type apparatus with a water-cooled oil receiver to reduce artifacts produced during distillation by over-heating according to Hellenic Pharmacopoeia [

 <italic>n</italic>-pentane and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and stored at −20 °C. The compositions of the volatile constituents were established by GC/MS analyses, performed on a Hewlett-Packard 7820A-5977B MSD system operating in EI mode (70 eV) equipped with a split/splitless injector, using a fused silica HP-5 MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm I.D., film thickness: 0.25 μm). Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 2.0 mL/min. The oven temperature was increased from 60 to 300 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min, and subsequently held at 300 °C for 10 min. Injection was at 220 °C in a split ratio 1:5. Injection volumes of each sample were 2 μL. Retention indices for all compounds were determined according to the Van den Dool approach [

 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes as standards. The identification of the components was based on comparison of their mass spectra with those of Wiley and NBS/NIST Libraries and those described by Adams (2017) [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-26-02124" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], as well as by comparison of their retention indices with literature data. In many cases, the essential oils were subjected to co-chromatography with authentic compounds (Fluka, Sigma). Semi-quantification through peak area integration from GC peaks was applied to obtain the component percentages. The analyses were carried out twice for each sample.
