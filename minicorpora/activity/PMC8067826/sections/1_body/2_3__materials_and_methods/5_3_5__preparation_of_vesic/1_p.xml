 <italic>O. onites</italic> and 
 <italic>S. thymbra</italic> essential oils (OOEO and STEO) were formulated in lipid nanovesicles by the lipid film hydration method [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-26-02124" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], in two steps [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-02124" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-26-02124" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Different amounts of phosphatidylcholine (P90G) and cholesterol were tested for the development of the formulation, and the experimental conditions of the preparation were optimized varying media and time of hydration, as well as the use of ultrasonic bath and/or mechanic stirrer, as reported in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02124-t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>. The selected formulations were prepared with 600 mg of phosphatidylcholine and 10 mg of cholesterol dissolved in dichloromethane, using the ultrasonic bath for 1 min in order to improve the dissolution. Subsequently, evaporation of dichloromethane was carried out using the rotavapor for 20 min at 30 °C, in order to obtain a homogenous lipid film on the internal surface of the flask. At this stage, OOEO (100 μL) or STEO (100 μL) or OOEO plus STEO (50 μL + 50 μL) were added to the flask and the lipid film was hydrated with 5 mL of 5%
