<p>EOs obtained from aromatic and medicinal plants, as well as their components have largely demonstrated antibacterial and antifungal properties against a wide range of microbial pathogens, including numerous food-borne pathogens and key spoilage bacteria [

 <xref rid="B9-molecules-26-02124" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Food poisoning is considered as one of the most common causes of illness and death in developing countries, which are associated with bacterial contamination especially from Gram-negative bacteria, mainly represented by 
 <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-26-02124" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Among Gram-positive bacteria, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> are the most causative agents of food-borne illnesses or food spoilage [

Over recent years, synthetic preservatives are largely used to successfully prevent and control bacterial contamination of food, but their use can result in unwanted chemical residues in food and feed chains. In addition, there is an increasing resistance of these pathogens to the synthetic preservatives [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-26-02124" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Hence, the discovery of alternative preservatives, mainly originated by natural sources have been increased during recent years. EOs are reported as potentially effective and safe natural food preservatives by many publications [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-26-02124" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Although EOs possess good antimicrobial properties, they have potential limitations for commercial applications due to their physical and organoleptic properties such as strong flavor, volatility and chemical instability. Consequently, different types of food-grade delivery systems, mainly nano-emulsions [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-02124" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], but also innovative nanocochleates [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-02124" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] have now been evaluated for improving their performance as antimicrobials.
