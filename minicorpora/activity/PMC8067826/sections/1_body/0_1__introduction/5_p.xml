<p>In this study, 
 <italic>O. onites</italic> and 
 <italic>S. thymbra</italic> EOs were isolated and analyzed by GC-MS, and for the first time, they were formulated in propylene glycol-nanovesicles, proposed as safe and food-grade delivery systems. Different nanovesicles were developed and optimized in terms of size and essential oil loading and were fully characterized as regards physical and chemical parameters. Successively, they were investigated for the antimicrobial activity against a panel of different bacteria and fungi, comparing the activity with that of pure essential oils. The safety profile was assessed by in vitro test on HaCaT cell line.
