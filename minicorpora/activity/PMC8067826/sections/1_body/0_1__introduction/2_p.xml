<p>Nanocarriers represent an innovative challenge to optimize the essential oil formulation, overcoming the main limitations [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-02124" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Liposomes are vesicles containing an aqueous phase entirely surrounded by a bilayer constituted of phospholipids and cholesterol, which can definitely load the essential oils. The resulting nanocarrier is stable and efficient, easily and safely produced, capable of stabilizing the essential oil, modulating its release and optimizing its activity [

 <italic>Melissa officinalis</italic> L. essential oil was successfully formulated in glycerosomes, being very active in vitro in inhibiting HSV type 1 infection of mammalian cells, without producing cytotoxic effects [

 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Salvia triloba</italic> L. plants, when formulated in liposomes [
