    "Plants with medicinal properties have been used in the treatment of several infectious diseases, including <i>Acanthamoeba</i> infections. The medicinal properties of Cambodian plant extracts; <i>Annona muricata</i> and <i>Combretum trifoliatum</i> were investigated against <i>Acanthamoeba triangularis</i>. A total of 39 plant extracts were evaluated and, as a result, 22 extracts showed positive anti-<i>Acanthamoeba</i> activity. Of the 22 extracts, 9 and 4 extracts showed anti-<i>Acanthamoeba</i> activity against trophozoites and cysts of <i>A. triangularis</i>, respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentration of <i>A. muricata</i> and <i>C. trifoliatum</i> extracts against trophozoites and cysts was 500 and 1,000 μg/mL, respectively. The combination of <i>A. muricata</i> at 1/4×MIC with chlorhexidine at 1/8×MIC demonstrated a synergistic effect against trophozoites, but partial synergy against cysts. A 40% reduction in trophozoites and 60% of cysts adhered to the plastic surface treated with both extracts at 1/2×MIC were noted comparing to the control (P < 0.05). Furthermore, a reduction of 80% and 90% of trophozoites adhered to the surface was observed after pre-treatment with <i>A. muricata</i> and <i>C. trifoliatum</i> extracts, respectively. A 90% of cysts adhered to the surface was decreased with pre-treatment of <i>A. muricata</i> at 1/2×MIC (P < 0.05). A 75% of trophozoites and cysts from <i>Acanthamoeba</i> adhered to the surface were removed after treatment with both extracts at 4×MIC (P < 0.05). In the model of contact lens, 1 log cells/mL of trophozoites and cysts was significantly decreased post-treatment with both extracts compared to the control. Trophozoites showed strong loss of acanthopodia and thorn-like projection pseudopodia, while cysts demonstrated retraction and folded appearance treated with both extracts when observed by SEM, which suggests the potential benefits of the medicinal plants <i>A. muricata</i> and <i>C. trifoliatum</i> as an option treatment against <i>Acanthamoeba</i> infections."
