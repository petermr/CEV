<p id="p0200">In summary, this research demonstrated that 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> and 
 <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> extracts substantially inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>A. triangularis</italic> trophozoites and cysts. Synergistic effect of 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> extract combined with chlorhexidine against 
 <italic>A. triangularis</italic> trophozoites was observed. Furthermore, both 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> and 
 <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> extracts showed partial synergy in combination with chlorhexidine against 
 <italic>A. triangularis</italic> cysts. Both extracts considerably inhibited the adhesion of 
 <italic>A. triangularis</italic> trophozoites and cysts to the plastic surface. Also, pre-treatment of the plastic surface with 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> at 1/2×MIC significantly diminished 90% of the cyst adhesion, compared with the control. It has been highlighted that the trophozoites treated with 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> and 
 <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> extracts have lost strong acanthopodia.
