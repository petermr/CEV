<p id="p0125">Due to the strong nature of the two layers of cyst walls, synergistic effects of 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> and 
 <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> extracts in combination with chlorhexidine against 
 <italic>A. triangularis</italic> were determined by checker board assay. As shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, combination of 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> at 1/4×MIC and chlorhexidine at 1/8×MIC demonstrated synergistic effects against 
 <italic>A. triangularis</italic> trophozoites with FIC index as 0.375. In addition, partial synergy of 1/2×MIC 
 <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> plus 1/8×MIC chlorhexidine against the trophozoites was observed. Both 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> and 
 <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> extracts showed partial synergy in combination with chlorhexidine against 
 <italic>A. triangularis</italic> cysts.
