<p id="p0145">Both extracts of 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> and 
 <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> reduced the adhesion of 
 <italic>A. triangularis</italic> trophozoites and cysts on the polystyrene surface. Therefore, we performed the effects of the extracts on the adhesion of 
 <italic>A. triangularis</italic> to contact lenses to apply the potential extracts as the agent for cleaning of contact lens. It was found that the adhesion of 
 <italic>A. triangularis</italic> was substantially inhibited by both the extracts at 1/2×MIC (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Nearly, 1 log cells/mL of the trophozoites was decreased when the cells were treated with 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> and 
 <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> extracts at 1/2×MIC compared to the control. Additionally, the extracts at 1/2×MIC marginally inhibited the adhesion of the cysts on the lens surface.
