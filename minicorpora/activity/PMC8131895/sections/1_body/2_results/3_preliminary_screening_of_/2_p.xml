<p id="p0115">Preliminary screening of antimicrobial activity of Cambodian plant extracts against the trophozoites and the cysts was determined at the concentration of 1000 μg/mL (the final concentration of DMSO was 1%). Of 39 evaluated plant extracts, 22 extracts had positively shown anti- 
 <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> activity (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), whereas 17 extracts were yielded negative results of the activity (at the tested concentration). Consequently, the percent inhibition of the viability of the trophozoites treated with the extracts ranged from 0-90%, whereas against cysts, inhibition ranged from 0-90.33%. Selection of the extracts for further study was carried out when they showed ≥90% growth inhibition (mean ± SD) of trophozoites and cysts, comparing with the negative control.
