<p id="p0120">Plant extracts that show ≥90% growth inhibition were chosen to determine the MIC values against 
 <italic>A. triangularis</italic>. The extracts exhibited strong anti-parasitic activity against 
 <italic>A. triangularis</italic> trophozoites and cysts. The results showed that the MIC values of the extracts ranging from 500–1,000 µg/mL, respectively (
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> and 
 <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> revealed the strongest anti-
 <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> activities against both trophozoites and cysts. The MIC values of both extracts against 
 <italic>A. triangularis</italic> trophozoites and cysts were 500 and 1,000 µg/mL, respectively. Hence, both extracts were chosen for further studies. The MIC values of antibiotics against 
 <italic>A. triangularis</italic> are presented in 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The final concentration of DMSO was 1% presented in the extracts.
