<p id="p0130">Effects of 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> and 
 <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> extracts at sub-MICs on adhesion of 
 <italic>A. triangularis</italic> were determined in 96-well polystyrene plastic plates. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, both extracts substantially reduced the adhesion of 
 <italic>A. triangularis</italic> trophozoites (Figures 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A and 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) and cysts (Figures 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B and 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) to the plastic surface (P &lt; 0.05). Approximately 40% decrease in the trophozoites adhesion to the plastic surface was observed, while 60% inhibition was also detected in cysts treated with both extracts at 1/2×MIC. At the time point, non-encystation of the trophozoites was observed when the cells were challenged with the extracts as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>.
