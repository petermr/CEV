<p id="p0150">The morphology of trophozoites and cysts treated with both extracts was observed by SEM. Amoeboid cells with many envelop spikes of 
 <italic>A. triangularis</italic> trophozoites were noted in the control group (Figures 
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>J-7L). It was found that the trophozoites contiguously adhered to the surface by several long acanthopodia (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>K). While, it was observed that cells changed to abnormal shape when treated with 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> (Figures 
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A-7C) and 
 <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> extracts (Figures 
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>D-7F). The treated cells showed lump shape like cystic form. Interestingly, the trophozoites cells had lost their mobility to each other and began to shrink after treatment with 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> and 
 <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> extracts. It has been highlighted that trophozoites treated 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> and 
 <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> extracts have lost robust acanthopodia (Figures 
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A, 7B, 7D, and 7E). Dried shape of the cells and pore formation were detected following treatment with chlorhexidine (Figures 
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>G-7I).
