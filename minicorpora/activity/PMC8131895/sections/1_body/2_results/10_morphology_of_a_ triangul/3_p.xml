<p id="p0155">The normal morphological characteristics such as triangular shape and soft surface of the cysts were observed in the control (Figures 
 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>J-8L). It has been highlighted that the cysts treated with 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> (Figures 
 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>A-8C) and 
 <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> (Figures 
 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>D-8F) extracts demonstrated forms of retraction, compared with the control. Furthermore, folded cysts were observed when the cysts were treated with 
 <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> (Figures 
 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>D-8F) and chlorhexidine (Figures 
 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>G-8I). Additionally, the cell wall surface of shrink cysts treated with 
 <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> (
 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>F) was vaguely perturbed when compared with the control and chlorhexidine treated cells. The final concentration of DMSO presented in the extracts at 4×MIC was 2%. However, this concentration of DMSO did not affect the growth and morphology of 
 <italic>A. triangularis</italic> as observed by trypan blue exclusion assay and inverted microscope (Fig. S1), respectively.
