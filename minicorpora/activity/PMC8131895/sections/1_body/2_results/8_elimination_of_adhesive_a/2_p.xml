<p id="p0140">Since 
 <italic>A. triangularis</italic> trophozoites and cysts adhered to the surfaces of plastic and contact lens, we further investigated the inhibitory activity of the extracts to eliminate the parasite on the surface. Treatment of the plastic plates containing monolayer of trophozoites and/or cysts was performed to eliminate the parasite. Of more than 75% elimination in 
 <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> trophozoite and cyst adhesion to the surface was observed after the treatment with 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> and 
 <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> extract at 4×MIC (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). The final concentration of 2% DMSO presented in the extracts was used in cyst experiment. However, this concentration of DMSO did not affect the growth and morphology of 
 <italic>A. triangularis</italic> as observed by trypan blue exclusion assay and inverted microscope (Fig. S1), respectively.
