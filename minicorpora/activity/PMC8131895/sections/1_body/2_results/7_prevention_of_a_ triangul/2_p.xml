<p id="p0135">Pre-treatment of the surface by 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> and 
 <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> extracts at sub-MICs was investigated in polystyrene 96-well plates. After that, the trophozoites and cysts of 
 <italic>A. triangularis</italic> were exposed to the wells. The findings demonstrated that 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> and 
 <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> extracts at sub-MICs significantly reduced the adhesion of the parasite to the surface (P &lt; 0.05). Approximately 80% and 90% decrease in the trophozoite adhesion was detected in 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> and 
 <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> treatment, respectively (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). Pre-treatment of the plastic surface with 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> at 1/2×MIC significantly decreased 90% of the cyst adhesion, compared with the control (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B) while 75% inhibition of cyst adhesion was detected after a treatment with 
 <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> extract comparing with the control.
