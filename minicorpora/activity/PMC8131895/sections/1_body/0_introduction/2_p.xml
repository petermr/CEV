<p id="p0010">Infection caused by 
 <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> spp., free-living protozoa, has been concerned worldwide. 
 <italic>Acanthamoeba triangularis</italic> (
 <italic>A. triangularis</italic>) is a causal agent of human disorders, such as granulomatous amebic encephalitis and 
 <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> keratitis (

 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bunsuwansakul et al., 2019</xref>). Two stages of 
 <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> growth are well known and these include trophozoites and cysts. The trophozoites are vegetative moving amoebic form while cysts are a quiescent stage that persists in stress condition such as absence of nutrient. 
 <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> trophozoites exhibited adhesion ability for contact lens through acanthopodia (

 <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> spp. is the major issue in contact lens users (

 <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> infections.
