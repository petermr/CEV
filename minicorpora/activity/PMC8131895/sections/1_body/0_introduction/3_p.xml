<p id="p0015">To surmount infections induced by the pathogen, plant-derived compounds could be used as an alternative strategy for its treatment. A study has reported the inhibitory effect from the seed of 
 <italic>Trigonella foenum-graecum</italic> extract on cysts from 
 <italic>A. castellanii</italic>
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Kaya et al. (2019)</xref>. Rhizome extract of 
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> and its pure compound, Curcumin, showed anti-microbial activity against 
 <italic>A. triangularis</italic> trophozoites and cysts (
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Mitsuwan et al., 2020a</xref>). Essentially, there is a recent interest in the combination therapy involving anti-microbial agents and other bio-active compounds from plant origin as a new method to treat infectious diseases. Synergistic effects of chlorhexidine in combination with cationic carbosilane dendrimers against both forms of 
 <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> spp., trophozoite and cyst have been reported (
