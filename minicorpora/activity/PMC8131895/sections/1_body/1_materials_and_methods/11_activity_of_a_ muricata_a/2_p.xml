<p id="p0100">The activity of 
 <italic>A. muricata and C. trifoliatum</italic> extracts to decrease the adhesion of the parasite on contact lens (Duna Plus, Singapore) was assessed as earlier reported (
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Mitsuwan et al., 2020b</xref>) with slight changes. Five hundred microliters of the microorganism (3×10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL) were dropped on contact lens in 24-well plate containing sub-MICs of the extracts. The samples were kept at room temperature for 24 h. One percent DMSO was used as negative control, while chlorhexidine was used as positive control. The samples were rinsed in PAS to remove non-adhesive cells. After that, the contact lens was solved in tubes holding 500 µL of PAS and mixed. The adhesive cells were stained using trypan blue. Then, the adhesive cells were detected under an inverted microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).
