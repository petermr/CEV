<p id="p0045">The determination of the MIC values of the extracts against the trophozoites and cysts was assessed by broth microdilution assay as reported in our previous study (
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Mitsuwan et al., 2020a</xref>). The trophozoites and cysts of 
 <italic>A. triangularis</italic> were grown in PYG medium as mentioned above. One hundred microliters of the suspension (2×10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL) of each group of trophozoites and cysts were dropped into 96 well plates, containing 100 µL of successively diluted extracts at concentrations 125–1,000 µg/mL. One percent DMSO was used as negative control, while chlorhexidine was used as positive control. The sample was incubated at room temperature for 24 h. The MIC value was specified as the lowest concentration that caused ≥90% the growth inhibition (mean ± SD) of the trophozoites and cysts as measured by the exclusion assay, comparing to the negative control.
