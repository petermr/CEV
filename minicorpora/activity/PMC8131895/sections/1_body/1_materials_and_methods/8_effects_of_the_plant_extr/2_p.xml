<p id="p0085">The activity of the plant extracts on adhesion of the amoeba was carried out using 96 well polystyrene plate (0.33 cm
 <sup>2</sup> of culture area, 0.075–0.2 mL of proposed working volume, VWR International, Missouri, USA). The experiment was performed as disclosed in our previous study (
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Mitsuwan et al., 2020b</xref>) with minimal changes. The parasite cultured in the culture medium were then grown in the medium supplemented with the extracts at sub-MICs. Sub-MICs of chlorhexidine were used as positive control, while 1% DMSO were used as negative control. The samples were then incubated at 25 °C for 48 h. Non-adhesive cells were eliminated by removing of the old medium. Later, the microplates were washed twice with PAS and air dried. Then, the samples were stained with 0.1% crystal violet assay for 30 min. Subsequently, the plates were washed twice by sterile distilled water. The samples were air dried overnight at room temperature. A total of 200 µL DMSO were added to dissolve the stained cells. The plates were measured at the optical density 570 nm. The activity of the extracts on the adhesion of 
 <italic>A. triangularis</italic> adhesion was reported as relative percentage of the adhesion. It was specified as: (mean A570 nm of treated well/mean A570 nm of control well) ×100.
