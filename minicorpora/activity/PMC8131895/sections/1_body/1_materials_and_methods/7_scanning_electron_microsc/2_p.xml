<p id="p0080">Effects of the extracts on morphology of the trophozoites and cysts was determined by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Zeiss, Munich, Germany) as previously reported (
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Mitsuwan et al., 2020b</xref>) with slight changes. Parasite cells were given the extracts at concentration 4×MIC on a sterile glass covers lip in a 24-well plate. The sample was incubated at room temperature for 24 h. Subsequently, samples were rinsed thrice with phosphate buffer solution (PBS) and fixation was done with glutaraldehyde at concentration 2.5% in PBS for 24 h. The discs were then washed with PBS. Subsequently, samples were dehydrated in a series of graded ethanol (20–100%). The samples were then dried using a critical point dryer. The samples were then coated with gold particles. The morphology (size shape and structure) of
