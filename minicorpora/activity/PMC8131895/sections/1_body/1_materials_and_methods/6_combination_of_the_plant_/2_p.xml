<p id="p0050">Checkerboard assay was used to examine synergistic effects of the plant extracts in combination with the antibiotic in comparison to their individual activities (
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Hwang etÂ al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, the MIC of each extract and chlorhexidine alone was investigated as described above. The checkerboard with twofold dilutions of the plant extracts and chlorhexidine was carried out to explore the synergistic effects of the plant extract in combination with the antibiotics. The growth inhibition of the combinations and the agents alone was measured by trypan blue exclusion assay. Fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC index) was determined as follows:
 <disp-formula id="ufd1">FICI = (MIC of extract in combination/MIC of extract alone) + (MIC of chlorhexidine combination/MIC of chlorhexidine alone).</disp-formula>
