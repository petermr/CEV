<p id="p0095">Effects of the elimination of adhesive 
 <italic>A. triangularis</italic> on the surface were done in 96 well plate as reported (
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Sudjana et al., 2012</xref>) with minor changes. In brief, an aliquot of 100 µL of the microorganism (3×10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL) was inoculated in the plate, incubated at room temperature for 24 h. After that, the pathogens were incubated in the medium containing the extracts at concentrations of the extracts at 2-4×MICs. The samples were incubated at room temperature for 24 h. It was noted that the final concentration of DMSO presented in the extract was 1% and 2% DMSO used as negative controls in trophozoite and cyst experiments, respectively. Also, chlorhexidine was included as a positive control. Plates were washed twice with PAS to remove non-adhesive cells. In order to investigate the elimination of the parasite, crystal violet assay was used to stain the adhesive cells on the plates. The plates were measured at the optical density 570 nm. Percentage of the survival cells was defined as: (mean A570 nm of treated well/mean A570 nm of control well)×100.
