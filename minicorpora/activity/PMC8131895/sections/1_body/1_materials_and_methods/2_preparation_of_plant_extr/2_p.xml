 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Plants were dried and extraction of materials was done with 95% ethanol and methanol solutions. Then, the extracted solvents were vaporized under lowered pressure. The extracts were air dried and weighed. Percent yield of the extracted samples was determined. Chlorhexidine (Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA) was used as positive control. The extracts and the antibiotics were dissolved in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and stored at 4 °C till use.
