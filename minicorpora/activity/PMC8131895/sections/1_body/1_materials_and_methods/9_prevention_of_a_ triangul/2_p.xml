<p id="p0090">Effects of the plant extracts to prevent the adhesion of 
 <italic>A. triangularis</italic> to the plastic surface were performed in the microtiter plate as previously described (
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Mitsuwan et al., 2020b</xref>). The polystyrene wells were pre-treated with the extract at sub-MICs. The samples were incubated at 4 °C for 24 h. One percent DMSO was used as negative control, while chlorhexidine was used as positive control. The extracts were removed and substituted with PYG (100 µL). One hundred microliters of the parasites (3×10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL) were put into the polystyrene wells. The plates were incubated at room temperature for 24 h. Crystal violet assay was used to investigate the activity of the extracts to prevent 
 <italic>A. triangularis</italic> adhesion to the surface as reported above.
