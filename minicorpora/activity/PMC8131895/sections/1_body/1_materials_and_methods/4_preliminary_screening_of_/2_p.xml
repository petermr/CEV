<p id="p0040">Preliminary screening of anti-parasitic activity of Cambodian plant extracts against the trophozoite and cyst forms of the amoeba was evaluated by trypan blue exclusion assay as followed (
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Mitsuwan et al., 2020a</xref>). Briefly, trophozoites and cysts were cultivated as depicted above. Then, the microorganisms were rinsed twice by Page's saline solution (PAS). Subsequently, the samples were centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 5 min. Viability of

 <sup>5</sup> trophozoites/mL) was dropped into 96 well plates, containing 100 µL of each extract at a concentration 1,000 µg/mL. The final concentration of DMSO presented in the extract was 1% DMSO. The samples were then incubated at room temperature for 24 h. One percent DMSO was used as negative control, while chlorhexidine was used as positive control. Inhibition of the parasite growth was investigated by trypan blue exclusion assay to determine the number of live (non-stained) and dead (stained) cells (

Selection of the extracts was carried out when they showed ≥90% the growth inhibition of the trophozoites and cysts, compared with the negative control.
