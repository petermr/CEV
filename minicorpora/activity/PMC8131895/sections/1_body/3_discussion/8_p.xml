<p id="p0190">Acanthopodia have been considered as the main adhesion structure of the organism to attach to the surfaces such as contact lenses (
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). A high number of the acanthopodia was detected from the pathogenic 
 <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> while the non-pathogenic parasites possessed less numbers of acanthopodia (
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Siddiqui and Khan, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, the adhesion of the pathogenic trophozoites to corneal cells was mediated by the acanthopodium spikes (spike-like pseudopodium) 
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Khan (2001)</xref>. It has been reported that absence of acanthopodia in 
 <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> trophozoites could not adhere to the corneal epithelial cells (
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Khan, 2004</xref>). In general, a mannose-binding protein participating in the adhesion of 
 <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> spp. to the host cells is expressed and located at acanthopodia (
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Garate et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, it has been documented that the suppression of mannose-binding protein reduced the binding of the organism to the corneal cells (
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Garate et al., 2006</xref>). Hence, the loss of acanthopodia after treatment with 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> and 
 <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> extracts could inhibit 
 <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> adhesion to the surface. We hypothesized that the loss of acanthopodia and the presence of shrunk cells after treatment with the extracts could reduce adhesion of parasites to the surface.
