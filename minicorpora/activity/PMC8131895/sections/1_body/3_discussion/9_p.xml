<p id="p0195">Overall, the results demonstrated that 
 <italic>A. muricata and C. trifoliatum extracts</italic> showed anti-
 <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> and anti-adhesion activities against 
 <italic>A. triangularis</italic>. Though, isolation of bio-active compounds presented in the plant species could not be possible due to the limitation of related facilities such as HPLC. Therefore, the combination of the extracts and available drug, chlorhexidine, has been used as an alternative approach for amoebicidal activities against 
 <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic>. To support this, nanoparticle synthesis using plant extracts or plant-derive compounds has been reported as one option to enhance the efficiency of these compounds against the pathogens. Recently, there has been a report on the synthesis of nanoparticles using gallic acid, a component of 
 <italic>Leea indica</italic> loaded in poly-D, L-lactide-co-glycolide nanoparticles inhibited the growth of trophozoites and cysts of 
 <italic>A. triangularis</italic> (

In light of our promising results, future study is strongly recommended to investigate the mechanism of the pure compounds in terms of nano-synthesis, metabolomics or docking simulation that will further enhance the discovery on the drug target of 
 <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> infection.
