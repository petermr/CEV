 <italic>Combretum</italic> species are widely used in traditional medicine against many infectious diseases including malaria (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">de Morais Lima et al., 2012</xref>). 
 <italic>Combretum mole</italic> extract had anti-plasmodial activity against 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic> in Swiss albino mice (
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Anato and Ketema, 2018</xref>). In addition, 
 <italic>C. fragrans</italic> and 
 <italic>C. padoides</italic> extracts revealed marked inhibition against Gram-positive bacteria such as 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> as well as 
 <italic>Enterobacter aerogenes</italic>, a Gram-negative bacterium (
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Fyhrquist et al., 2002</xref>). Moreover, there is no report on the activity of 
 <italic>Combretum</italic> species including 
 <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> extracts against free-living amoeba including 
 <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> spp. Therefore, this study has revealed the anti-
 <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> activity of 
 <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> extracts against both trophozoites and cysts of 
 <italic>A. triangularis</italic>. To our knowledge, for the first time, the evidence-based report on 
 <italic>A. triangularis</italic> inhibition with this plant species is described.
