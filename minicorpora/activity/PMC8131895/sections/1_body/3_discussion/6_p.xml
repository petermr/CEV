 <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> extract combined with chlorhexidine revealed a partial synergy against 
 <italic>A. triangularis</italic> of both trophozoites and cysts. Similarly, synergistic effects of the plant in the genus 
 <italic>Combretum</italic> spp. in combination with antibiotics against bacteria have been reported (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Chukwujekwu and van Staden, 2016</xref>). It has been highlighted that the combination of 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> and chlorhexidine at sub-MICs demonstrated synergy against the trophozoites. Combination therapy of antibiotics plus antibiotics or other bio-active compounds to treat infectious diseases such as tuberculosis is gradually becoming a subject of interest and applied to others. Currently, treatment of 
 <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> infections comprises of drug combination therapy of biguanides, amidines, and azoles (

 <italic>A. polyphaga</italic> trophozoites and cysts have been documented (
