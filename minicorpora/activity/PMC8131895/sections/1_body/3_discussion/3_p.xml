<p id="p0165">Our study assessed the anti-
 <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> activity of Cambodian medicinal plants, including 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> and 
 <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> extracts against trophozoites and cysts of 
 <italic>A. triangularis</italic>. To support our findings, amebic metabolic activity of 
 <italic>A. castellanii</italic> was reduced following its treatment with multipurpose solutions containing 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> extract. Moreover, the solution suppressed pseudocyst formation in the organism (

 <italic>A. muricata</italic> aqueous leaf extract inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> infected mice with no toxicity (

 <italic>A. muricata</italic> leaves exhibited anti-microbial activity against 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Osorio et al., 2007</xref>). Besides, anthelmintic effects of the aqueous leaf extract against eggs, infective larvae and adult forms of 
 <italic>Haemonchus contortus</italic> isolated from sheep have been reported (
