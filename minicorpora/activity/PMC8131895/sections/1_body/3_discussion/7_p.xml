<p id="p0185">Our study has demonstrated that 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> and 
 <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> extracts significantly exhibited anti-
 <italic>A. triangularis</italic> adhesion to the plastic surface and contact lens. This result is in agreement with the previous study reported on 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> inhibited the adhesion of 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> on hydroxyapatite discs, resulting in plaque forming inhibition (
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Rahman et al.,2018</xref>). It was also observed that flat and adjacent trophozoites adhered to the surface via several acanthopodia in the control, while the treated trophozoites demonstrated shrunken cells. Moreover, the trophozoites treated with 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> and 
 <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> extracts displayed a lump shape like cystic form. In addition, small pores formation was also noted when the cells were treated with 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> extract. It has been emphasized that the trophozoites treated with both 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> and 
 <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> extracts have lost strong acanthopodia. Similarly, 
 <italic>A. lugdunensis</italic> L3a trophozoites treated with contact lens care multiuse solutions demonstrated a shrunk-like cystic shape (
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). Clearly, 
 <italic>A. triangularis</italic> cysts treated with 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> and 
 <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> extracts demonstrated deformities of retraction and shrink cells, compared with the smooth surface control.
