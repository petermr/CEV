  <p>Effects of 
   <italic>A. muricata</italic> and 
   <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> extracts on adhesion of 
   <italic>A. triangularis</italic> WU19001 trophozoites at 24 h. The cells were grown in PYG medium, and treated with the agents at different concentrations, incubated for 24 h. Chlorhexidine and 1% DMSO was included as positive and negative control, respectively. Images of the adhesion were observed by inverted microscope (200X).
