  <p>Effects of 
   <italic>A. muricata</italic> and 
   <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> extracts on adhesion of 
   <italic>A. triangularis</italic> WU19001 trophozoites (A) cysts (B) on contact lens. The organism was treated with 1/2×MIC of the agents, incubated at room temperature for 24 h. Inhibitory activity was carried out using cell counting by trypan blue exclusion assay. Chlorhexidine and 1% DMSO were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The data was presented as mean ± SD (∗significant difference; P &lt; 0.05).
