  <p>Effects of 
   <italic>A. muricata</italic> and 
   <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> extracts on adhesion of 
   <italic>A. triangularis</italic> WU19001 trophozoites (A) and cysts (B) at 24 h. The organism was treated with different sub-inhibitory concentrations of the agents, incubated at room temperature for 24 and 48 h. Inhibitory activity was carried out using crystal violet assay. Chlorhexidine and 1% DMSO were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The relative percentage of the adherence was defined as: (mean of the treated cells/mean of the negative control) × 100, (∗significant difference; P &lt; 0.05).
