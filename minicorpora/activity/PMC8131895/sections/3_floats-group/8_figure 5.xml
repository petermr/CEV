  <p>Effects of 
   <italic>A. muricata</italic> and 
   <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> extracts on elimination of 
   <italic>A. triangularis</italic> WU19001 trophozoites (A) cysts (B). The organism was cultured in PYG medium to form monolayer cells on 96 well plate at 24 h. The parasite was further treated with different concentrations of the agents, incubated at room temperature for 24 h. Inhibitory activity was carried out using crystal violet assay. Chlorhexidine was included as a positive control. While, 1% DMSO and 2% DMSO were used as negative controls for the trophozoites and cysts, respectively. The data was presented as mean ± SD (∗significant difference; P &lt; 0.05).
