  <p>Prevention of adhesion of 
   <italic>A. triangularis</italic> trophozoites (A) and cysts (B) to the plastic surface by 
   <italic>A. muricata</italic> and 
   <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> extracts. The surface was treated with the extracts at different concentrations, kept at 4 °C for 24 h. Then, the parasitic cells were added, incubated at room temperature for 24 h. Inhibitory activity was carried out using crystal violet assay. Chlorhexidine and 1% DMSO were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The relative percentage of the adherence was defined as: (mean of the treated cells/mean of the negative control) × 100, (∗significant difference; P &lt; 0.05).
