   <italic>A. muricata</italic> (A–C) and 
   <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> (D–F) extract observed by SEM. The cells were treated with the extracts at 4×MIC. Chlorhexidine (G–I) and 1% DMSO (J–L) were used as positive and negative control, respectively. Magnifications were revealed as: J = 2,500X; A, B, E, D, G, H, K = 10,000X; C, F, I, L = 30,000X.
