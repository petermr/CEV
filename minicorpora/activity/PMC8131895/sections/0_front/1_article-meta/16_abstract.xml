 <p>Plants with medicinal properties have been used in the treatment of several infectious diseases, including 
  <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> infections. The medicinal properties of Cambodian plant extracts; 
  <italic>Annona muricata</italic> and 
  <italic>Combretum trifoliatum</italic> were investigated against 
  <italic>Acanthamoeba triangularis</italic>. A total of 39 plant extracts were evaluated and, as a result, 22 extracts showed positive anti-
  <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> activity. Of the 22 extracts, 9 and 4 extracts showed anti-
  <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> activity against trophozoites and cysts of 
  <italic>A. triangularis</italic>, respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentration of 
  <italic>A. muricata</italic> and 
  <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> extracts against trophozoites and cysts was 500 and 1,000 μg/mL, respectively. The combination of 
  <italic>A. muricata</italic> at 1/4×MIC with chlorhexidine at 1/8×MIC demonstrated a synergistic effect against trophozoites, but partial synergy against cysts. A 40% reduction in trophozoites and 60% of cysts adhered to the plastic surface treated with both extracts at 1/2×MIC were noted comparing to the control (P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, a reduction of 80% and 90% of trophozoites adhered to the surface was observed after pre-treatment with 
  <italic>A. muricata</italic> and 
  <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> extracts, respectively. A 90% of cysts adhered to the surface was decreased with pre-treatment of 
  <italic>A. muricata</italic> at 1/2×MIC (P &lt; 0.05). A 75% of trophozoites and cysts from 
  <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> adhered to the surface were removed after treatment with both extracts at 4×MIC (P &lt; 0.05). In the model of contact lens, 1 log cells/mL of trophozoites and cysts was significantly decreased post-treatment with both extracts compared to the control. Trophozoites showed strong loss of acanthopodia and thorn-like projection pseudopodia, while cysts demonstrated retraction and folded appearance treated with both extracts when observed by SEM, which suggests the potential benefits of the medicinal plants 
  <italic>A. muricata</italic> and 
  <italic>C. trifoliatum</italic> as an option treatment against 
  <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> infections.
