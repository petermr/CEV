 <xref rid="B26-plants-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] have been previously published, confirming the presence of a wide variety of phytochemicals, of which about one hundred different compounds have been described to date. In this study, the medicinal uses of 
 <italic>Ch. glutinosus</italic> in Spain will be compiled and its chemical composition will be reviewed to validate or refute the therapeutic properties attributed to the species in Spanish folk medicine, which will be carried out using a bibliographic review of clinical trials and in silico simulation to predict the molecular targets of the phytochemicals present in the plant.
