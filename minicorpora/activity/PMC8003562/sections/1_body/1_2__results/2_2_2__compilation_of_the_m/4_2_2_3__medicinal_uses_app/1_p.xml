<p>The five medicinal uses of 
 <italic>Chiliadenus glutinosus</italic> compiled to treat the genitourinary system are prepared in infusion, in the four different Autonomous Communities. The infusion of this plant is taken to help urinate more frequently, since it is considered to be diuretic, in towns in Region of Murcia, southeast of Castilla-La Mancha, and Cantabria. Moreover, in Region of Murcia and southeast of Castilla-La Mancha, it is recommended to take this infusion when suffering from kidney pains or to promote the elimination of kidney stones. Finally, in some towns of Region of Murcia and north of Andalusia, it is recommended to drink the infusion to treat kidney diseases in general and to “improve the kidney” by taking the infusion preventively to avoid possible infections, kidney stones, etc. (
