<p>Three medicinal uses of 
 <italic>Chiliadenus glutinosus</italic> have been compiled in three Autonomous Communities. The plant is applied as a decoction, macerated in alcohol, and as an infusion to treat conditions of the locomotor system, mainly to combat rheumatic and bone pain. In locations of north of Andalusia, the plant is cooked, and the resulting liquid is applied in the form of baths in the joint areas where pain is suffered, and in the Region of Murcia, the fresh plant is collected and left to macerate in alcohol for some time. Then, that alcohol is applied in the form of rubbing to relieve sore areas from rheumatism. Finally, the plant is also used as an internal infusion to relieve body fatigue in southeast of Castilla-La Mancha (
