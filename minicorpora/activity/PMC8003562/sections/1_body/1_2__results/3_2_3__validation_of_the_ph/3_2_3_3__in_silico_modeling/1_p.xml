<p>The Swiss Target Prediction software [
 <xref rid="B102-plants-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] was used to estimate the macromolecular targets most likely to bind to the bioactive compounds camphor, borneol, lucinone, glutinone, kutdtriol, quercetin, and kaempferol, present in 
 <italic>Chiliadenus glutinosus.</italic> This tool statistically quantifies the probability that two similar bioactive molecules share their protein targets. Therefore, when performing a query on the possible binding targets of a specific bioactive molecule, the tool displays and arranges the possible molecular targets from highest to lowest binding probability, up to a maximum of one hundred targets. At times, there can be a 100% binding probability. In these cases, the similarity is total. Therefore, it is likely that the experimental bioactivity of the consulted molecule is known, and it is not a real prediction. What can also happen is that no objective is obtained in the prediction. On this occasion, the input molecule is below the thresholds of similarity in 2D and 3D with any of the known active molecules against which were examined and compared.
