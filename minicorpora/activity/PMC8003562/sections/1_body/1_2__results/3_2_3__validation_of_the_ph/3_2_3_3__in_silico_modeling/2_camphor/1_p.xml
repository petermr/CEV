<p>The camphor molecule was introduced into the Swiss Target Prediction [
 <xref rid="B102-plants-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] simulator, which assumes it is a bioactive molecule and calculates the binding targets. As a result, 22 camphor-binding targets were obtained in 
 <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, with binding probabilities between 4% and 20%. The first six results shown in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00584-t009" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref> have a probability of between 10% and 20% of being targets of the camphor molecule.
