<p>Twenty-eight binding targets were obtained in the case of the borneol molecule, in 
 <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, with binding probabilities between 4% and 35%. The first 12 results obtained have a probability of between 10% and 35% of binding to the borneol molecule. In this case, only the first four results with the highest probability of binding to the borneol are shown in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00584-t010" ref-type="table">Table 10</xref>, which shows probabilities between 31% and 35%. The rest of the targets with binding probabilities lower than 30% are not shown. The first results show as main borneol, the carbonic anhydrases I, II, and IV (36%), and a transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 8 (31%).
