<p>For the quercetin molecule, 100 binding targets were obtained in 
 <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, with binding probabilities between 21% and 100%. The first 67 results have a 100% join probability. In 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00584-t012" ref-type="table">Table 12</xref>, the first six targets, NADPH oxidase 4, the vasopressin receptor V2, aldose reductase, xanthine dehydrogenase, monoamine oxidase A, and the insulin-like growth factor I receptor, all with a 100% binding probability. The rest of the objectives are not shown.
