<p>In the case of the kaempferol molecule, 100 binding targets were obtained in 
 <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, with binding probabilities between 17% and 100%. The first 17 results have a binding probability of 100%. In 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00584-t013" ref-type="table">Table 13</xref>, the first six targets have been selected as examples: NADPH oxidase 4, aldose reductase, xanthine dehydrogenase, tyrosinase, tyrosine-protein kinase receptor FLT3, and carbonic anhydrase II. All these targets showed a 100% binding probability with the kampferol, the rest of the results are not shown. Finally, it is worth mentioning that the simulations with the lucinone and kutdtriol molecules did not give results, so it has not been possible to predict the binding targets of these compounds in 
 <italic>Homo sapiens.</italic>
