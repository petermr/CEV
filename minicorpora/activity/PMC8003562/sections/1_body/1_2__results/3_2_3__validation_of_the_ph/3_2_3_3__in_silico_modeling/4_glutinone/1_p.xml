<p>In the case of the glutinone molecule, 32 binding targets were obtained in 
 <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, with binding probabilities between 12% and 100%. The first three results shown in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00584-t011" ref-type="table">Table 11</xref> have been selected since they have a probability of between 23% and 100% of being targets of the glutinone molecule. The remaining results for targets with binding probabilities less than 23% are not displayed. Of all the targets analyzed, cycloxigenase 1 (100%), cytochrome P450 (54%), and cathepsin D (23%), showed the highest probability of being glutinone binding targets.
