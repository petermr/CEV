<p>Several investigations on the chemical composition of 
 <italic>Chiliadenus glutinosus</italic> have been published previously and have identified about one hundred different chemical compounds [

 <xref rid="B26-plants-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In the present study, it has been decided to select and analyze the following seven phytochemicals: camphor, borneol, lucinone, glutinone, kutdtriol, quercetin, and kaempferol, from the total of compounds, as they are present in greater proportions in the essential oil of 
 <italic>Ch. glutinosus</italic>. The study of the biological activity of the selected phytochemicals could contribute to support or refute the traditional medicinal uses of the species in Spain. Hereunder,
