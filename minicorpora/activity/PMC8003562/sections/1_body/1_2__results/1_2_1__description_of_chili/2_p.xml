It has a narrow rhizome with long and thin roots that are introduced between the rocks. The leaves are 10–25 × 2–5 mm in size and are lanceolate, sharp, erect-patent and, covered with glandular hairs. The flower heads are 7–15 mm wide and are gathered in corymbose or cymose inflorescences, sometimes also solitary. The involucre is 8–15 mm long and has bracts in several rows.

In each flower head, there are between 55 and 105 yellow florets, and there are no ray florets. The cypsela is pubescent with glandular hairs at the apex.
