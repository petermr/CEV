<p>Firstly, an exhaustive bibliographic search was carried out to compile the medicinal uses of the 
 <italic>Chiliadenus glutinosus</italic> species in Spain, the chemical composition, and previous clinical trials on the biological activity of some phytochemicals present in the species. For this, specialized databases such as Dialnet, Google Scholar, Pub Med, or ScienceDirect, were used. Keywords were used to search for information such as “traditional uses”, “ethnobotany”, “traditional medicine”, combined with the correct species name “
 <italic>Chiliadenus glutinosus</italic>”, or its synonymous plant names such as “
 <italic>Jasonia glutinosa</italic>”, “
 <italic>Jasonia saxatilis</italic> (Lam.) Guss.”, “
 <italic>Erigeron glutinosus</italic> L.”, or “
 <italic>Inula saxatilis</italic> Lam.”, and finally the names of the provinces or Autonomous Communities of Spain where the plant lives were added to these search terms. Finally, the names of the molecules present in the species such as “borneol” or “camphor”, were also used as keywords. The chemical structures of some molecules present in 
 <italic>Chiliadenus glutinosus</italic> were obtained from the public domain PubChem database [
 <xref rid="B117-plants-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>], maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) of the United States.
