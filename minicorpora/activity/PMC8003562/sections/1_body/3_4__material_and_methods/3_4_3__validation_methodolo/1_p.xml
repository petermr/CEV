<p>Finally, in silico modeling was performed using the Swiss Target Prediction online tool [
 <xref rid="B102-plants-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] to predict the targets of the bioactive molecules present in 
 <italic>Chiliadenus glutinosus</italic>. This tool is based on the so-called “principle of similarity”, which establishes that two similar molecules also have similar properties. Therefore, when introducing a bioactive molecule into the tool to query the possible targets to which it can be attached, a prediction is made based on the combination of 2D and 3D similarity between a set of approximately 370,000 assets in known targets. Once the query is made, the tool displays and arranges the possible molecular targets from highest to lowest probability of binding.
