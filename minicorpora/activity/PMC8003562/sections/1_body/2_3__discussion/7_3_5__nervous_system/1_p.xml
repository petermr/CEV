<p>The infusion of 
 <italic>Chiliadenus glutinosus</italic> has been used as a remedy to treat states of nervousness, elevate mood, and clear the mind in Catalonia, southeast of Castilla-La Mancha, center of Valencian Community, and Navarre. Some compounds present in 
 <italic>Ch. glutinosus</italic> such as borneol, have shown sedative or anxiolytic effects that could justify the above uses. Trials were performed in mice that were induced pain with acetic acid injection and hot plate, and the results corroborated the sedative effect of borneol, due to its mentioned action on the modulation of the GABA system [

This infusion has also been used to treat headaches in east of Castilla-La Mancha and north of Andalusia), which could be justified by the analgesic effect of borneol, an important central and peripheral antinociceptive, and anti-inflammatory [

In other studies, its topical analgesic effect has been proven, relieving pain in patients with postoperative pain, since this compound induces a topical analgesia mediated by the cationic cold receiving channel TRPM8 and a descending glutamatergic mechanism in the spinal cord. Another reported effect of borneol is the neuroprotective effect. The blood–brain barrier (BBB) plays an essential role in maintaining a stable homeostatic environment, so its destruction or increased permeability are common pathological processes in many serious diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). In another study, the administration of borneol exerted a significant decrease in the permeability of the blood–brain barrier, keeping it at stable levels and having a preventive effect on possible CNS pathologies or cerebral ischemic lesions [
