<p>Reviewing other articles, evidence of other beneficial effects on the circulatory system of some compounds present in 
 <italic>Chiliadenus glutinosus</italic> has also been found. The possible antidiabetic effect of kaempferol and quercetin stands out, being able to significantly improve insulin-stimulated glucose absorption in mature adipocytes [

 <xref rid="B85-plants-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] or the possible neuroprotective and vasodilator effect of kaempferol [

 <xref rid="B101-plants-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. However, no scientific evidence has been found linking the use of 
 <italic>Ch. glutinosus</italic> infusion in localities of Murcia as a treatment for anemia. According to the prediction in Swiss Target Prediction [
 <xref rid="B102-plants-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>], quercetin and kaempferol have affinity for the enzyme NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), which can regulate the insulin signaling cascade (

 <xref rid="plants-10-00584-t013" ref-type="table">Table 13</xref>). Therefore, there could be a certain relationship between these compounds and their possible anti-diabetic effect, although a more exhaustive study would be necessary to know the mechanisms involved.
