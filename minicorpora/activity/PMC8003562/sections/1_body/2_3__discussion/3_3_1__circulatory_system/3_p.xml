<p>The 
 <italic>Chiliadenus glutinosus</italic> infusion has also been used in north of Valencian Community, Region of Murcia, and southeast of Castilla-La Mancha to reduce the pain of swollen legs or improve circulation in people who suffer from varicose veins. Camphor and borneol have been shown in human clinical trials to have anti-inflammatory effects. In addition, camphor can increase blood flow locally in skin and muscle, in turn providing sensations of cold and heat, which achieves an effect of improving blood circulation and could give some relief to the aforementioned conditions [

 <xref rid="B73-plants-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. The main mechanism proposed for the anti-inflammatory effect of borneol could be based on the fact that this compound significantly decreased the release of interleukins IL-8 and IL-6 (molecules involved in inflammatory processes [

Camphor has also been shown to activate transient specific calorific potential receptors TRPV1 and TRPV3, and the human and rat cold-sensitive channel transient receptor (TRPM8). According to the prediction of the

 <xref rid="plants-10-00584-t010" ref-type="table">Table 10</xref>), camphor can bind to carbonic anhydrase I (CA1), an enzyme responsible for the regulation of cellular pH and mediator of cerebral vascular permeability, and borneol that is known having an affinity for the TRPM8 receptor, and sensitive to temperature changes.
