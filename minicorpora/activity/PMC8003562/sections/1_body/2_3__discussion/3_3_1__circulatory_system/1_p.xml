The study suggests that the underlying hemodynamic mechanisms can be attributed to an increase in total peripheral resistance induced by an increase in the tone of the arterioles, thereby counteracting an orthostatic drop in blood pressure. This infusion has also been used with the opposite effect as a remedy for hypertension in Catalonia. It has been proven in other clinical trials that daily oral administration of quercetin in rats with induced hypertension, progressively reduces systolic pressure, which is why antagonistic effects are observed for different compounds present in the same species [
