<p>Furthermore, it is worth mentioning the antiproliferative activity of quercetin. This cytotoxic action could be related to the incapacity to release lactate, the reduction of the nucleotide 5’-adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the stimulation of the production of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-b1), known for its antiproliferative activity, and blocking potassium channels. Quercetin can also prevent cancer cells from developing cellular thermotolerance, and therefore a greater efficacy could be achieved through anticarcinogenic treatment by clinical hyperthermia [

Secondly, there are studies that corroborate the antigenotoxic effect of borneol on rats’ hepatocytes and testicular cells when it is administered orally in drinking water. It was verified that borneol reversed the oxygen and glucose deprivation followed by reperfusion-induced neuronal injury, nuclear condensation, the production of reactive intracellular oxygen species (ROS), and dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential in cortical neurons [
