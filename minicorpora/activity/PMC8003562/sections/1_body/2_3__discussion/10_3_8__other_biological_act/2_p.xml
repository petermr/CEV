<p>Firstly, borneol, camphor, kaempferol, and quercetin have antioxidant properties. It has been proven in vitro tests that the administration of borneol can reduce oxidative reactions and the toxicity of free radicals by increasing the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), a powerful antioxidant enzyme that plays a bio-protective role by alternatively catalyzing the dismutation of the superoxide radical in molecular oxygen or hydrogen peroxide in living cells [
