<p>Traditionally, the infusion of 
 <italic>Chiliadenus glutinosus</italic> was used to treat some conditions related to the genito-urinary system. In some towns in Region of Murcia and southeast of Castilla-La Mancha, the infusion is consumed to relieve kidney pain. This use may be related to the anti-inflammatory and analgesic effect of borneol and camphor, already discussed [

 <xref rid="B70-plants-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Quercetin and kaempferol could also provide anti-inflammatory effects. The infusion was reported in the Region of Murcia, as a remedy for kidney diseases (e.g., urinary infections caused by microorganisms) This use could be related to the antimicrobial activity of the compounds present in

Other reported uses of this infusion were as a diuretic drink in Cantabria, southeast of Castilla-La Mancha, and Region of Murcia to treat kidney stones, although no related trials or scientific evidence have been found to justify these applications. However, the Swiss Target Prediction software [
 <xref rid="B102-plants-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] shows as a molecular target of quercetin, the vasopressin arginine receptor (AVPR2), involved in water reabsorption in the kidneys (
