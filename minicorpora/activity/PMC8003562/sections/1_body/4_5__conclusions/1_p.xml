<p>After the corresponding review of specific literature on previous clinical trials and the in silico predictions of possible molecular targets of the phytochemicals present in higher proportions in the essential oil of 
 <italic>Chiliadenus glutinosus</italic>, suggest the biological activities related to the compounds present in the plant, and outline its potential which must be confirmed by clinical studies of these majority compounds. Therefore, the potential properties provided by the presence of camphor borneol, quercetin, kaempferol lucinone, glutinone, and kutdtriol in 
 <italic>Ch. glutinosus</italic>, establish a link between the therapeutic effects to a large part of the reported uses of the species to treat several conditions of the organic systems of the human being in traditional Spanish medicine.
