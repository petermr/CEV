<p>Overall, the present study provides evidence, for the first time, of the antifungal and anti-inflammatory potential of 
 <italic>B. rigidum</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>paniculatum</italic> essential oil from Portugal. The oil showed high amounts of monoterpene hydrocarbons (94.4–96.6%), namely α-pinene (29.0–36.0%), β-pinene (26.1–30.7%) and limonene (10.5–13.5%) and demonstrated a broad fungicidal effect, particularly against 
 <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> and 
 <italic>Trichophyton rubrum</italic>. Moreover, a significant germ tube inhibition as well as a disruption of mature biofilms for 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> was pointed out and for both 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>T. rubrum</italic> significant ultrastructural alterations were observed. Finally, 
 <italic>B. rigidum</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>paniculatum</italic> essential oil also evidenced anti-inflammatory activity, without affecting macrophages´ viability, further endorsing its exploitation as a natural source of bioactive compounds for the development of drugs with concomitant antifungal and anti-inflammatory effects. Nevertheless, further in vivo studies are needed to validate the efficacy of the essential oil. Moreover, the clinical relevance of our results depends on the availability of the essential oil on target organs. Therefore, pharmacokinetic studies are essential to link in vitro effects to in vivo efficacy.
