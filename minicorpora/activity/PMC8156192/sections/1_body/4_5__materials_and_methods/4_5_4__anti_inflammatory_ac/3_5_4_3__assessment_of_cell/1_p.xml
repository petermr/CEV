<p>Cell respiration, an indicator of cell viability, was performed using a colorimetric assay with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT). The cells were cultured and treated as referred above. After cells treatments, 43 µL of MTT solution (5 mg/mL in phosphate buffered saline) were added to each well and the microplates were further incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Supernatants were centrifuged (1000× 
 <italic>g</italic> during 5 min) to recover viable cells. To dissolve formazan crystals formed in adherent cells in the microplates, 300 µL of acidified isopropanol (0.04 M HCl in isopropanol) were added to each cell and recovered to the respective tube containing the pellet formed after centrifugation. Quantification of formazan was performed using an ELISA automatic microplate reader (SLT, Salzburg, Austria) at 570 nm.
