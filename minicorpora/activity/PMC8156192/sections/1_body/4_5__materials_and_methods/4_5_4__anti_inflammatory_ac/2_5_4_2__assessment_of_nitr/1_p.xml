<p>To evaluate the anti-inflammatory potential of the oils, the in vitro model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages was used. The cells (0.6 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/well) were cultured in a 48-well microplate and left to stabilize for 12 h. The cells were then incubated for 24 h in the culture medium alone (control) or with different concentrations of the essential oils (144–576 µg/mL).The production of nitric oxide (NO) was measured by the accumulation of nitrites in the culture medium, using the colorimetric Griess reaction. Briefly, 170 µL of culture supernatants were added to an equal volume of Griess reagent [0.1% (
