<p>To assess the effect of the essential oil on fungal growth, two parameters were assessed: the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimal lethal concentration (MLC). A broth macrodilution method was used according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) reference protocols M27-A3 and M38-A2, for yeasts and filamentous fungi, respectively. Serial dilutions of the oil (up to 0.036 Âµg/mL) were tested as well as a negative control (medium without fungi) and a positive control (inoculated medium with DMSO 1%).</p>
