<p>To assess the effect of the oil on the yeast–hyphae transition, cell suspensions of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> ATCC 10231, from overnight cultures on SDA, were prepared in NYP medium [N-acetylglucosamine (10–3 mol/L), Yeast Nitrogen Base (3.35 g/L), proline (10–3 mol/L), NaCl (4.5 g/L), and pH 6.7 ± 0.1] [

 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL and then distributed into glass test tubes (990 μL). Then, subinhibitory concentrations of the essential oil or fluconazole (10 µL) were added and incubated without agitation for 3 h, at 37 °C. The number of germ tubes (germinating protuberance at least as long as the diameter of the blastopore) were recorded using a light microscope (40×) and DMSO 1% (
