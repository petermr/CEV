 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>T. rubrum</italic> were selected to perform the transmission electron microscopy studies. Cultures untreated (DMSO 1%) or treated with the essential oil (MIC) were used. Fungi cultures were collected and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min. Pellet cells were fixed using 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) for 2 h and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide during 1 h. Following rinsing, samples were embedded in 2% molten agar, dehydrated in ethanol (30â€“100%), and impregnated and included in epoxy resin (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Ultrathin sections (70 nm) were obtained and stained with uranyl acetate 2%, for 5 min followed by lead citrate 0.2% for 5 min. Observations were carried out on a FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit Bio Twin at 100 kV.
