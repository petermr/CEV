<p>Biofilm viability was determined using the XTT/menadione metabolic assay. Briefly, menadione (10 mM in acetone) was added to a XTT solution (1 mg/mL in PBS) to a final concentration of 4 µM. A volume of 100 µL of this solution was added to each well and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in the dark. The absorbance was measured at 490 nm and cell viability expressed as [(AbsT/AbsC) × 100], where AbsT represents the absorbance of the treated cells and AbsC the absorbance of control cells (without essential oil or fluconazole).</p>
