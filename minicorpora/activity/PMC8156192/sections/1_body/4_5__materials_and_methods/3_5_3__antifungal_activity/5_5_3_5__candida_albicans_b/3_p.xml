<p>Biofilm biomass was assessed using the crystal violet assay. Following the treatment period, performed as referred above, the culture medium was removed and cells were fixed with methanol 99% for 15 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the wells air dried. Then, 100 µL of crystal violet (CV) solution (0.02%) was added to each well and left to stain the biofilm for 15 min. After CV removal, the wells were washed twice with sterile water to remove excessive reagent. Then, 150 µL of acetic acid 33% were added to release the stain from the cells and the supernatant was transferred to a 96-well microtiter plate. The absorbance was then read at 620 nm using a microtiter plate reader. Biomass decrease was determined as [(AbsT/AbsC) × 100], where AbsT represents the absorbance of each treated well and AbsC the absorbance in the control wells. Negative and positive controls comprising biofilm-free and oil-free wells, respectively, were also included.</p>
