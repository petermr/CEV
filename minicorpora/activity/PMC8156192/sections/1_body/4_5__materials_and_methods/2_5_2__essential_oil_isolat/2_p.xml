<p>A Hewlett-Packard 6890 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) chromatograph with a single injector, two flame ionization detectors and a HP GC ChemStation Rev. A.05.04 data handling system was used for GC analysis. Two columns: polydimethylsiloxane (SPB-1) and polyethylene glycol (SupelcoWax-10) with 30 m × 0.20 mm and a film thickness 0.20 µm were used and GC parameters were as follows: oven temperature: 70–220 °C (3 °C/min), 220 °C (15 min); injector temperature: 250 °C; carrier gas: helium, with a linear velocity of 30 cm/s; splitting ratio 1:40; detectors temperature: 250 °C. A Hewlett-Packard 6890 gas chromatograph (SPB-1 column), interfaced with an Hewlett-Packard mass selective detector 5973 (Agilent Technologies, Centerville Road Wilmington, DE, USA) with a HP Enhanced ChemStation software, version A.03.00 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was used for GC–MS analysis. MS parameters: source temperature: 230 °C; MS quadruple temperature: 150 °C; ionization energy: 70 eV; ionization current: 60 µA; scan range: 35–350 units; scans per second: 4.51; interface temperature: 250 °C.</p>
