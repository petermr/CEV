 <italic>paniculatum</italic> essential oils from Portugal showed high amounts of monoterpene hydrocarbons with α-pinene, β-pinene and limonene standing out as the main compounds. Similar compounds were also reported for essential oils obtained from plants collected in Montes Toledo, Spain, although in these plants myrcene was also found in high amounts (26.2%) [
 <xref rid="B36-antibiotics-10-00592" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These differences might be due to different growing locations with diverse abiotic factors that may influence the biosynthesis of essential oils. In a previous work, we developed a protocol for the in vitro propagation of 
 <italic>Bupleurum</italic> species and observed the presence of the major compounds inside secretory ducts of the in vitro propagated plantlets of 
 <italic>B. rigidum</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>paniculatum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B37-antibiotics-10-00592" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Since secondary metabolites signature in spontaneous plants was also found in the in vitro propagated plants, this technique could enable a large-scale production of this species, thus reducing the influence of abiotic factors and enabling the production of uniform essential oils. Furthermore, this approach could allow a year-round plant supply.
