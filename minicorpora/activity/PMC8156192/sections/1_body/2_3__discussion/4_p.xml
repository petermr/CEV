<p>Furthermore, the present study reports for the first time the anti-inflammatory potential of 
 <italic>B. rigidum</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>paniculatum</italic>. Nevertheless, other studies have pointed out promising effects for other 
 <italic>Bupleurum</italic> species. For example, the essential oil from 
 <italic>B. fruticosum</italic>, rich in α- and β-pinene, thymol and carvacrol, was able to decrease the edema in a carrageenan-induced edema model [
 <xref rid="B23-antibiotics-10-00592" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and that of 
 <italic>B. frutiscens</italic>, characterized by α-pinene and β-caryophyllene, also showed effects in paw edema induced by carrageenan and prostaglandin (PG) E1 [
 <xref rid="B24-antibiotics-10-00592" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Moreover, 
 <italic>B. gibraltaricum</italic> essential oil with high amounts of Δ-3-carene and α-pinene, showed anti-inflammatory effects in both carrageenan-induced paw edema and granuloma-induced inflammation [

 <xref rid="B52-antibiotics-10-00592" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Additionally, the production of PGE2 and the activity of lipoxygenase was decreased in the presence of 
 <italic>B. marginatum</italic> essential oil [
 <xref rid="B22-antibiotics-10-00592" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Overall, these results corroborate the anti-inflammatory effects observed in the present study as all species present similar major compounds to those found in 
 <italic>B. rigidum</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>paniculatum</italic>, namely pinene isomers. Accordingly, several reports have shown the anti-inflammatory effect of isolated major compounds including α- and β-pinene as well as limonene [
 <xref rid="B53-antibiotics-10-00592" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="B54-antibiotics-10-00592" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,
 <xref rid="B55-antibiotics-10-00592" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In addition, minor compounds, such as 1,8-cineole [
 <xref rid="B56-antibiotics-10-00592" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], camphor [
 <xref rid="B56-antibiotics-10-00592" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,
 <xref rid="B57-antibiotics-10-00592" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] and γ-terpinene [
 <xref rid="B58-antibiotics-10-00592" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] have also been assessed in a plethora of assays, thus suggesting that these compounds may contribute to 
 <italic>B. rigidum</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>paniculatum</italic> anti-inflammatory potential.
