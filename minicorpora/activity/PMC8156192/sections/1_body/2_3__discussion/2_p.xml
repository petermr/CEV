<p>To the best knowledge of the authors, no reports on the bioactive potential of 
 <italic>B. rigidum</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>paniculatum</italic> have been conducted. Nevertheless, the antimicrobial activity of other 
 <italic>Bupleurum</italic> species has already been reported. For example, the essential oil isolated from 
 <italic>B. marginatum</italic>, rich in tridecane, undecane, pentadecane, β-caryophyllene and β-caryophyllene oxide, showed a MIC of 4 mg/mL towards two strains of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and inhibited several bacterial strains, including methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MIC = 0.063–4 mg/mL) [
 <xref rid="B22-antibiotics-10-00592" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The antifungal activity of 
 <italic>B. gibraltaricum</italic>, characterized by sabinene, α-pinene and 2,3,4-trimethylbenzaldehyde, was demonstrated for 
 <italic>Plasmopara halstedii</italic> through fungal sporulation inhibition at 5 mL/L [
 <xref rid="B30-antibiotics-10-00592" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The essential oil from 
 <italic>B. longiradiatum</italic>, having thymol, butylidene phthalide, 5-indolol, heptanal, 4-hydroxy-2-methylacetophenone, 4,5-diethyl-octane, borneol and hexanoic acid as main compounds, was able to inhibit the growth of several bacteria with MIC ranging from 250–500 μg/mL [
 <xref rid="B27-antibiotics-10-00592" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The essential oil herein presented showed a broad antifungal activity, very effective against 
 <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> and 
 <italic>Trichophyton rubrum</italic> (MIC = 72 µg/mL). The antifungal effect of the essential oil might be attributed to the presence of several compounds with strong antifungal activity, namely α-pinene, limonene, β-pinene and myrcene [

 <xref rid="B46-antibiotics-10-00592" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Regarding the anti-virulent effects of 
 <italic>Bupleurum</italic> spp., no studies have been conducted until now. Nevertheless, the major compounds of the essential oil were able to decrease the yeast-to-hypha transition in 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Indeed, β-pinene [
 <xref rid="B47-antibiotics-10-00592" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-antibiotics-10-00592" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and limonene [
 <xref rid="B48-antibiotics-10-00592" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] were described as germ tube inhibitors. Similarly, the capacity of the oil to disrupt preformed 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> biofilms might also be attributed to the presence of limonene and β-pinene as both compounds have been described as effective in disrupting mature biofilms. Nevertheless, the influence of minor compounds cannot be discarded. Indeed, myrcene and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene were also able to inhibit the formation of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> biofilms [
 <xref rid="B48-antibiotics-10-00592" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].
