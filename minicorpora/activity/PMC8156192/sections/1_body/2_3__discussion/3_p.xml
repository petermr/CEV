<p>Regarding ultrastructural characterizations, studies on dermatophytes are scarce, thus highlighting the relevance of our results. In 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species, essential oils tend to act on ergosterol synthesis, modify fungal cell morphology, modulate membrane permeability and produce reactive oxygen species [
 <xref rid="B49-antibiotics-10-00592" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In accordance, our observations showed alterations in the cell wall structure as well as cytoplasmic disorganization, thus contributing to an overall modification of fungal cell morphology. Similar effects were reported for conventional antifungal drugs, namely caspofungin alone or in conjugation with pyroquilon in 
 <italic>Alternaria infectoria</italic> [
 <xref rid="B50-antibiotics-10-00592" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], suggesting a similar mechanism of action for 
 <italic>B. rigidum</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>paniculatum</italic> essential oils. Regarding 
 <italic>T. rubrum</italic>, our results clearly show that the essential oil induces an increase in the number of vacuoles, thus suggesting an activation of autophagic pathways. Similar results were shown for 
 <italic>Microsporum gypseum</italic> treated with resorcinol derivatives [
