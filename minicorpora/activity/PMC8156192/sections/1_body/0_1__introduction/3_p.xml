<p>Importantly, fungal infections also trigger an inflammatory response when fungal epitopes such as zymosan, bind to toll-like receptors (TLRs) in the host cells. TLRs binding triggers a series of intracellular cascades that culminate with the activation of pro-inflammatory transcription factors as well as the expression of several inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1 β), IL-6 and TNF-α, which further fuel the inflammatory response [
