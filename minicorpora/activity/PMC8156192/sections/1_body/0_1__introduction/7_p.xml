<p>Among 
 <italic>Bupleurum</italic> species, 
 <italic>B. rigidum</italic> L. is one of the most widely represented in Portugal. This species is widely used in Spain for the treatment of topical inflammation, as anti-diarrheic and against furuncles [
 <xref rid="B21-antibiotics-10-00592" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Two subspecies of 
 <italic>B. rigidum</italic> have been described, namely subsp. 
 <italic>paniculatum</italic> and subsp. 
 <italic>rigidum</italic>. 
 <italic>B. rigidum</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>paniculatum</italic> (Brot.) H.Wolff is an endemic species to the south and center of Portugal, Andaluc√≠a (Spain) and North Africa [
 <xref rid="B32-antibiotics-10-00592" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and, up to date, no studies on this subspecies have been conducted. Therefore, and as part of our ongoing studies on the valorization of wild Apiaceae species, we aim to characterize the essential oil composition of 
 <italic>B. rigidum</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>paniculatum</italic> from Portugal and assess its bioactive potential. A combined antifungal and anti-inflammatory potential for 
 <italic>B. rigidum</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>paniculatum</italic> essential oil is reported, with emphasis on its effect against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> virulence factors.
