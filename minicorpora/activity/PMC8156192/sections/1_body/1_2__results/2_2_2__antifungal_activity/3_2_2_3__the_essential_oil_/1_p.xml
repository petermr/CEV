<p>Bearing in mind the promising fungicidal effect observed against 
 <italic>T. rubrum</italic> as well as the inhibition of virulence factors registered in 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, both strains were selected to further elucidate the effect of the essential oil at an ultrastructural level. For this, transmission electron microscopy analysis were performed.

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00592-f004">Figure 4</xref> compile representative images of the alterations observed in 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>T. rubrum</italic>, respectively, in comparison to non-treated fungal cells. Overall, untreated cells showed a well-defined surface with and integral cell wall (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00592-f004">Figure 4</xref>a,b) while treated cells (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00592-f004">Figure 4</xref>c–h) presented a structural disorganization, particularly at the cell wall (e.g., 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00592-f003">Figure 3</xref>c and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00592-f004">Figure 4</xref>c), for 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>T. rubrum</italic> respectively. These alterations can be due to an impairment in the deposition of cell wall constituents. In 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> cytoplasmic disintegration was also observed (e.g., 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00592-f003">Figure 3</xref>h). Particularly for 
 <italic>T. rubrum</italic> an increased number of vacuoles was observed with the accumulation of electron dense material (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00592-f004">Figure 4</xref>c–h), reflecting a defensive mechanism of the fungus. As the number of vacuoles significantly increased with the essential oil treatment, it seems that autophagy is activated [
 <xref rid="B35-antibiotics-10-00592" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Indeed, autophagic structures were observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00592-f004">Figure 4</xref>h), thus suggesting that the oil activates this pathway as a protective mechanism of the fungi.
