<p>The antifungal potential of 
 <italic>B. rigidum</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>paniculatum</italic> essential oil was assessed against several yeast, dermatophyte and 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> strains as depicted in 
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00592-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Besides collection strains, fungal isolates obtained from the clinic were also assessed, thus providing data on the antifungal potential of the oil against more resistant strains. Overall, the essential oil showed a significant antifungal effect against 
 <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> and 
 <italic>Trichophytum rubrum</italic> with MIC values of 72 µg/mL (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00592-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). For the remaining dermatophytes, the oil was also effective with MIC values ranging from 144 µg/mL to 288 µg/mL. In addition, relevant antifungal effects were observed for 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> and the majority of 
 <italic>Candida</italic> strains (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00592-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Interestingly for the majority of the tested stains, the oil showed similar MIC and MLC values, thus presenting a fungicidal effect (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00592-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). This is quite relevant since azoles, namely flucanozole, an antifungal drug widely used in the clinic, shows primarily fungistatic effects. Indeed, this antifungal drug, for the majority of the tested strains, is able to inhibit fungal growth but at the MIC it is not lethal to the fungi.
