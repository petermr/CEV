 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> is able to switch from yeast-to-hypha morphology promoting tissue invasiveness [
 <xref rid="B33-antibiotics-10-00592" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and to form biofilms, an organized structure more resistant to antifungal agents than planktonic fungi [
 <xref rid="B34-antibiotics-10-00592" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. These features play a pivotal role in 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> pathogenesis and virulence, thus constituting promising therapeutic targets. Therefore, the present study aimed to assess the effect of the essential oil on both features (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00592-f002">Figure 2</xref>). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00592-f001">Figure 1</xref>, the essential oil strongly inhibited germ tube formation in 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> at concentrations well below its respective MIC. Interestingly, at concentrations as low as MIC/8 (72 μg/mL) the oil inhibited germ tube formation by ca. 40% and at MIC/4 (144 μg/mL), 88% of inhibition was observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00592-f001">Figure 1</xref>a). Fluconazole failed to accomplish this up to 200 μg/mL, as pointed out in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00592-f001">Figure 1</xref>b, thus highlighting the relevance of our results.
