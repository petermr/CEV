<p>Chronic inflammation contributes to the successful colonization of the host tissues by pathogenic fungi, thus compromising disease suppression. Indeed, an antifungal drug with inherent anti-inflammatory activity, would enable a rapid symptomatic relief while providing an effective treatment. Therefore, we also assessed the anti-inflammatory potential of the essential oil using an in vitro model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages. The effect on NO production, a canonical marker of inflammation, was analyzed by measuring the accumulation of nitrites in the culture medium. Moreover, the effect of the oil on macrophages’ viability was also tested (

Interestingly, nitrite production was significantly reduced in the presence of the essential oil, attaining a decrease of more than 51% with 576 µg/mL of the oil (17.15 ± 3.35 µM) and a decrease of 33% with half the concentration (23.53 ± 3.93 µM;
