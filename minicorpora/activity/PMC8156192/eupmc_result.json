    "Fungal infections remain a major health concern with aromatic plants and their metabolites standing out as promising antifungal agents. The present study aims to assess, for the first time, the antifungal and anti-inflammatory potential of <i>Bupleurum</i> subsp. <i>paniculatum</i> (Brot.) H.Wolff essential oil from Portugal. The oil obtained by hydrodistillation and characterized by GC-MS, showed high amounts of monoterpene hydrocarbons, namely α-pinene (29.0-36.0%), β-pinene (26.1-30.7%) and limonene (10.5-13.5%). The antifungal potential was assessed, according to CLSI guidelines, against several clinical and collection strains. The essential oil showed a broad fungicidal effect being more potent against <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> and dermatophytes. Moreover, a significant germ tube inhibition was observed in <i>Candida albicans</i> as well as a disruption of mature biofilms, thus pointing out an effect of the oil against relevant virulent factors. Furthermore, fungal ultrastructural modifications were detected through transmission electron microscopy, highlighting the nefarious effect of the oil. Of relevance, the oil also evidenced anti-inflammatory activity through nitric oxide inhibition in macrophages activated with lipopolysaccharide. In addition, the essential oil's bioactive concentrations did not present toxicity towards macrophages. Overall, the present study confirmed the bioactive potential of <i>B. rigidum</i> subsp. <i>paniculatum</i> essential oil, thus paving the way for the development of effective drugs presenting concomitantly antifungal and anti-inflammatory properties."
