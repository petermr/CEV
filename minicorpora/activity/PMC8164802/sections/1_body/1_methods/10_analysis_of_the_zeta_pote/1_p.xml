<p id="Par24">The zeta potential is defined as the potential that forms between the oil droplet and the liquid phase. Stable formulations have a positive or negative potential that is greater than 30â€‰mV. A NanoBrook Omni 280,173 (Brookhaven, New York) was used to measure the zeta potential of the nanoemulgel formulation.</p>
