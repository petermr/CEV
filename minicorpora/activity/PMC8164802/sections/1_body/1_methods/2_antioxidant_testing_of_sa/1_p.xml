<p id="Par11">The antioxidant activity of the safrole oil was evaluated using the free radical-scavenging assay. DPPH was used to measure the scavenging activity of the oil. Stock solutions of the safrole oil and trolox (as a standard reference compound) were prepared at a concentration of 1 mg/mL, from which serial dilutions were carried out (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, 50, 80 and 100 μg/mL). One millilitre of the stock solution and 1 ml of methanol were mixed with 1 ml of DPPH solution. The solution was then incubated in the dark for 30 min at room temperature, and the blank solution was prepared by replacing the stock solution with methanol. Trolox was used as a control, and the absorbance was measured by a UV–Visible (UV–Vis) spectrophotometer at 517 nm, which was compared with the control. The following equation was used to calculate the percentage of DPPH inhibition by the trolox standard and the safrole oil:
