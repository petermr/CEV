<p id="Par27">Muller Hinton agar is a bacterial crop medium containing 2 g of beef extract, 1.5 g of starch, 17.5 g of casein hydrolysate, and 17 g of agar per liter of filtered water. The media were created by combining the components and heating them with restlessness until they boiled. The media was then autoclaved at 121 °C for 20 min. Following cooling, the agar was poured onto a flat surface in sterile plates of petri, which were held in a depth of 4 °C. Sabouraud dextrose agar containing 40 g dextrose, 10 g of peptone and 20 g of agar per liter of distilled water was the medium used for fungal production. As mentioned above, the media was prepared.</p>
