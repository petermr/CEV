<p id="Par30">The RPMI-1640 media was used to culture hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Hep3B cells) and combined with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin antibiotics and 1% l-glutamine. Cells were cultivated with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37 °C in a moist environment. Cells were plated on a 96-well substrate at 2.6 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well. Various concentrations of the safrole oil and safrole oil nanoemulgel were incubated for 24 h, and after 48 h cell viability was measured in compliance with the guidance of the supplier (Promega Company, Madison, WI) by a CellTilter96® Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation (MTS) Assay. In brief, 20 μL of MTS solution was applied at the end of treatment per 100 μL of medium and incubated at 3 wells [
