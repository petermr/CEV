<p id="Par29">For inoculation of normal bacterial cultures, a plate containing Muller Hinton agar was inserted with 6-mm opening. A was negative control, B was loaded with safrole oil natural, C was filled with the safrole oil nanoemulgel and D was eventually packed with 500 mg of amoxicillin dissolved with 10 mL of water in the bacterial test. The plate was incubated at 35 °C for 24 h. The fungal assay consisted of 100,000 IU nystatin and was incubated for 48 h at 37 °C. Antimicrobial activity was measured using the diameter of the inhibition zone.</p>
