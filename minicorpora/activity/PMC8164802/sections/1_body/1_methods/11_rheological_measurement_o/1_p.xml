<p id="Par25">The rheological performance of the nanoemulgel formulations obtained at different Carbopol® 940 concentrations (0.4, 0.6, 0.8%) as a gelling agent was assessed at ambient temperature using a rotational viscometer (Brookfield DV1, USA). All measurements were performed in triplicate. In the shear rate range (0–100 rpm), the viscosity was calculated.</p>
