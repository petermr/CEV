<p id="Par20">A NanoBrook Omni 280,173 (Brookhaven, New York) was used to determine the polydispersity index (PDI) and droplet size of the nanoemulsion. The mean and standard deviation were measured in triplicate. The formulation that provided the smallest droplet size with the lowest PDI and the highest amount of oil was selected.</p>
