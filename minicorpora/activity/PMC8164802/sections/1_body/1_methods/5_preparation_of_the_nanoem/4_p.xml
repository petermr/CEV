<p id="Par19">A ternary phase diagram using the three elements above was generated to refine the formulation of nanoemulsion. Using a sensitive balance, each formulation was measured and then vortexed (CLASSIC Advanced Vortex Mixer) for 2â€‰min. The oil was then emulsified with water under gentle agitation. Finally, the physical properties have been calculated and based on these characteristics the ideal formulation has been chosen.</p>
