<p id="Par52">The safrole nanoemulgel displayed a higher and enhanced zone of inhibition compared to the pure oil antibacterial action. There are many reasons behind these findings. First, since the nano-droplets are small in size and have a huge surface, they result in greater penetration and action [

 <italic>Withania somnifera</italic> cream on microbial growth. He found an increase in 
 <italic>Withania somnifera</italic> cream silver nanoparticle penetration, which led to growth inhibition. Furthermore, the packaging of nanoparticles in bacteria increases the concentration of medicines that enter bacteria by increasing the contact between medicines and bacteria [

In 2019, Eid et al. reported an improvement in the antimicrobial activity of fusidic acid and a sodium fusidate nanoemulgel, which related to their nano-size as well as to an increase in the drugâ€™s residency time by the bacteria lead to more penetrating effect [
