<p id="Par55">The techniques of nano-formulation in relation to conventional drug delivery systems are proposed for promising alternatives since these include exclusive drug supplies. These findings were proved by several studies, Taghipour et al., conducted a study on the anticancer activity of polyphenol nanoformulations as bioactive agents and concluded that the advantages of natural polyphenol against cancer can be potentiated through nanonisation through multiple pathways. The nanoformulations led to increased antineoplasty, higher intracellular polyphenol concentration, slow and long-term drug release, and improved proapoptotic activity against tumour cells [
