<p id="Par51">In semisolid preparations, rheological measurements are important for mechanically describing the system (flow properties) and for controlling the consistency, which is necessary to guarantee the performance and durability of the formulation. A higher viscosity can affect the release of drugs and their bioavailability due to the decreased drug delivery from the vehicle [

The rheological nature of the safrole nanoemulgel was pseudo-plastic, i.e., the viscosity decreased as the shear rate increased.
