<p id="Par46">Droplet size was a key factor in the success of the nanoemulsion since the rate of release and absorption could be influenced. Furthermore, because of the smaller particle size and the large interfacial region, the bioavailability improved rapidly if the droplet was less than 200â€‰nm. The right mixture of surfactant and co-surfactant resulted in a smaller globule size, leading to a higher mechanical barrier that explained the prevention of globule aggregation [
