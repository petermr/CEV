<p id="Par45">A ternary phase diagram was established for identifying the self-nanoemulsion regions and for choosing the suitable surfactant, and co-surfactant concentrations used in the formulation of an optimum safrole nanoemulsion. The diagram was drawn to demonstrate the best formulation for achieving droplet sizes of less than 200â€‰nm. Due to the perfect combination of solubility, The hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB) values, and molecular geometry, a high nanoemulsion region of safrole oil was probable, as verified by Mayer and his team [
