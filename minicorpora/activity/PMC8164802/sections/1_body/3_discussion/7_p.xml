<p id="Par47">The PDI is another parameter with a value that is similar to the droplet size in the nanoemulsion formula. The distribution of the droplet size is often called the homogeneity measurement distribution. As the PDI value small values, it displays homogeneity (narrow distribution of the particles size) and better emulsion with greater physical stability.</p>
