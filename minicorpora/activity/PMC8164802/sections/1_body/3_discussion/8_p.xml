<p id="Par48">Nanoemulgels with safrole oil were made with a variety of Carbopol 940 concentrations (0.4, 0.6 and 0.8% w/w). Carbopol is a gelling agent ingredient that gives the formulation swelling properties [

The technique of self-emulsification was employed to emulsify the ideal nanoemulsion formula which contains Tween 80 as surfactant, Span 80 as a co-surfactant, oil and distillation water. The nanoemulgel was formulated by continuously agitation of nanoemulation with the Carbopol 940 hydrogel. The viscosity, droplet size and size distribution of nanoemulgel formulations were calculated.
