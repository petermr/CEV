<p id="Par54">A study conducted by Catalan and his team on nine derivatives from safrole assessed the antiproliferative effect using different human cell lines. Some safrole derivatives demonstrated better antiproliferative effects than the parent compound on breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7) and a colorectal cancer cell line (DLD-1). These findings support the findings of the current study since safrole showed anticancer activity on different cancer cell lines [

In another study carried out by Song et al. on safrole from Cinnamomum longepaniculatum leaf and its activity against cancer cell growth on human hepatoma cell line (BEL-7402). This study showed that safrole significantly suppressed cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner [
