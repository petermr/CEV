<p id="Par44">Amylase is a carbohydrate digestion enzyme with several forms, one of which is alpha-amylase, which is produced by the salivary and pancreas gland. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic condition that has become a large burden on the health system, and its prevalence has increased dramatically because of the population’s sedentary lifestyle and obesity. One approach proposed in the treatment of type II DM is to limit the ingestion of glucose into the intestine, and this is accomplished through medications that act by inhibiting the metabolic enzymes involved in the mechanism of digestion of specific glucose sugars, namely α-amylase. This results in successful outcomes in term of a reduction in the glucose levels in blood and in the treatment of the disease. Several plants demonstrate the distinct inhibitory action of this enzyme, which may be a healthy substitute and a potential source of new medicines [

 <sub>50</sub> of safrole oil proves that safrole oil has potent α-amylase inhibitory activity and that it could be an excellent candidate for manufacturing potential antidiabetic herbal supplements.
