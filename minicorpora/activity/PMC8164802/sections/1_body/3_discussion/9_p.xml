<p id="Par49">There was no substantial variation between the size of the droplets and the PDI of the safrole oil in the form of a nanoemulsion or when it was converted to a nanoemulgel. The measured stability is defined as the magnitude of the zeta potential in the submicron preparation. When the droplets have high negative and positive zeta potential, the droplets will repel each other, and if the values are low, there is dispersal instability since they are not stopped by force.</p>
