<p id="Par50">There is a boundary line between unstable and stable dispersions, which is usually + 30 or − 30 mV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. The zeta potential of the droplets was considered stable if it was more than + 30 mV or less than − 30 mV. The zeta potential of the safrole nanoemulgel formulations varied from − 35 to − 40 mV because of the nature of non-ionic surfactants, which reinforce the device by forming a layer around its surface. There were no significant variation between the results of the safrole nanoemulsion and the nanoemulgel, therefore, the quality of nanoemulgels developed was not impaired [
