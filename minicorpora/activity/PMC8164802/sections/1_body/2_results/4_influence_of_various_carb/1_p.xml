<p id="Par36">The findings regarding the average droplet size that the developed drugs are on the sub-micron scale with a low PDI, indicating a narrow distribution of droplet size. The findings regarding the optimum formulation for the nanoemulsion were compared with the results of nanoemulgel formulations obtained with a mean droplet size and PDI. FigureÂ
