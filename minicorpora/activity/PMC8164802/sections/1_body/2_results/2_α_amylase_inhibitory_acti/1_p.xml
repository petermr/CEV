<p id="Par33">The α-amylase inhibitory activity of safrole oil was determined and compared with the positive control (acarbose). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> showed that the safrole oil effectively increased the inhibition rate of the α-amylase enzyme, which has an IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 11.36 ± 0.67 μg/ml, in comparison with acarbose, which is the reference compound that had an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 5.88 ± 0.63 μg/mL.
