<p id="Par34">To choice an appropriate formulation for a nanoemulsion with droplet size below 200 nm and a PDI of less than 0.3, two separate compilations of surfactant/co-surfactant with safrole oil were utilized to create the ternary phase diagrams (Tween 80/Span 80 and Tween 20/Span 80). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> represents the phase diagrams of safrole oil nanoemulsions made using Tween80/Span 80 and Tween 20/Span 80. Nanoemulsions are those formulations with a droplet size of less than 1 μm, which are represented by the green area.
