<p id="Par35">Both surfactants have shown a different behaviour during the emulsion preparation. Tween 80 was capable of producing a nanoemulsion with droplet sizes of less than 200 nm, while Tween 20 produced a nanoemulsion with a droplet size greater than 200 nm. However, the ideal nanoemulsion composition was chosen not only based on its scale but also the oil concentration and the PDI in the selected formulations, as can be seen in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Therefore, the optimum formulation of the nanoemulsion was prepared from 51.2% Tween 80, 12.8% Span 80, and 36% safrole oil, that has a droplet size of 116.17 nm and a PDI of 0.207.
