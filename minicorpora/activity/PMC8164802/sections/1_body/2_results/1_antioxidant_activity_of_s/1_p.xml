<p id="Par32">The antioxidant activity of safrole oil is related to the scavenging activity of free radicals, it was comparatively lower than the Trolox reference standard, which is known to have high antioxidant activity. However, the results shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> revealed that safrole oil has antioxidant activity, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 50.28 ± 0.44 μg/mL for safrole oil and an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.55 ± 0.32 μg/mL for Trolox.
