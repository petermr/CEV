<p id="Par38">Typically, the flow properties of semisolid pharmaceutical products are normally regulated and measured by the rheological characteristics, which are critical to ensure the consistency and effectiveness of the formulation. The rheological analysis of the safrole nanoemulgel formulations is shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. With an increase in shear rate, the viscosity decreased; therefore, the rheological behaviour of the nanoemulgel is pseudo-plastic.
