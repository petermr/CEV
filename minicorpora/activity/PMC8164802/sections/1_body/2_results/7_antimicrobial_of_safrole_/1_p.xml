 <bold>Antimicrobial</bold> results obtained from this work show that safrole oil has various bioactivity against the growth of microbes (MRSA, 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli, Klebsiella, Proteus vulgaris,</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>) and as shown by the positive control (amoxicillin). The safrole oil showed no activity against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Klebsiella</italic> and partial resistance against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and MRSA. However, it showed good bacterial inhibition against 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris</italic>. However, it showed no activity against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and only partial activity against 
 <italic>Klebsiella</italic>. The results of the in vitro antibacterial activities were calculated in terms of the zone of inhibition diameter (mm), and they are recorded in TableÂ
