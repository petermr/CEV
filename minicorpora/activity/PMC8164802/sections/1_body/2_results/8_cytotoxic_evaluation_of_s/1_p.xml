<p id="Par40">The MTS assay was used to determine the cytotoxicity effect of pure safrole oil and the safrole nanoemulgel dosage form on Hep3B hepatocellular carcinoma cells. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, different concentrations were used to investigate the cytotoxicity of the compounds. As shown in the figure, the safrole nanoemulgel showed higher cancer cell inhibition (87.25%) when compared with the safrole oil (75.72%). The IC50 value for the safrole nanoemulgel and the safrole oil was 0.31 ± 0.02 mg/mL and 1.08 ± 0.06 mg/mL, respectively. The results demonstrate an interesting outcome since the safrole oil showed activity against the cancer cell line. In addition, this activity clearly increased when safrole oil was in the form of a nanoemulgel.
