 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], Twenty-three naturally occurring and synthetic alkenylbenzene derivatives that are structurally related to safrole (1-allyl-3,4-methylenedioxybenzene) were tested for their hepatic-carcinogenicity in mice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and were classified as group 2B carcinogen extracted from betel quid-chewing, one of the major risk compounds for oral squamous cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma development [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In this work, we tried to evaluate the safrole nanoemulsion against various biological targets.
