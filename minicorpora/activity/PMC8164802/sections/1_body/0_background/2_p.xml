<p id="Par6">A nanoemulsion is a drug delivery system consisting of emulsified oil and water, with an average droplet size of 5–200 nm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. It is considered a highly kinetically stable system that prevents creaming, flocculation, and aggregation from occurring [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. It can deliver both hydrophilic and lipophilic drug agents and can be administered via different routes, such as topical, oral, and parenteral routes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. An emulsion is a compound composed of at least two immiscible liquid phases, one of which is distributed into the other as globules. It is an effective dosage type for drugs with low water-solubility [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, emulsions have certain limitations because of some parameters, such as pH, temperature, and stability. The emulsions may also be subjected to creaming, coalescence, and flocculation [
