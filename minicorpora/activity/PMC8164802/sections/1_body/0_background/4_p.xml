<p id="Par8">In the last few years, pharmaceutical research has focused more on natural bioactive compounds. Plant extracts or raw plants have a range of phytochemicals and bioactive components that provide synergistic therapeutic effects, which have multi-target effects in the curing of diseases [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and as antidiabetic agents since diabetes mellitus is considered one of most common diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The use of medicinal plants is considered one of the major approaches to the production of natural medicinal agents [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Recently, many researchers have investigated the different types of herbs to determine or improve their therapeutic properties or to determine their isolated compounds for use in the pharmaceutical industry and clinical practice [
