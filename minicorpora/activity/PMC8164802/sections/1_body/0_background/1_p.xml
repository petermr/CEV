<p id="Par5">Nanotechnology has influence many areas of science in recent years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The word “nano” means miniature size or very small structure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and nanotechnology can be defined as the employment of science using different tools and systems to make extremely small structures. Nano-dosages of pharmaceuticals are different from the bulk forms, which have specific biological and physiochemical properties [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This technology has many advantages in various science fields, especially in the production of dosage forms and the pharmaceutical industry; it is used to make the medication more effective, to deliver drugs to a specific site, to improve the stability of dosage forms, and to produce cheaper dosage forms with less side effects, which leads to improve patient compliance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In addition, the different types of nano-dosages help to boost drug stabilisation and drug absorption and increase the passage of poorly soluble drugs into the cell, which is typically due to their large surface area. The use of nano-dosage types has ensured substantial progress in the development of drug delivery systems, some of which include nanoemulgels, nanoemulsions, and liposomes [
