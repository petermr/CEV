<p id="Par56">The present study demonstrated the potential antidiabetic, antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anticancer activities of safrole oil. It can be concluded that safrole oil has potent α-amylase and oxidant inhibitory activity compared to acarbose and Trolox. In addition, the safrole oil nanoemulgel was prepared using the self-emulsifying technique with droplet sizes below 200 nm and showed high stability, as indicated by its low zeta potential and narrow size distribution. The safrole nanoemulgel improved the activity against different microbial species when compared with pure safrole oil. Moreover, regarding the cytotoxicity assay, safrole oil was tested against a human cancer cell line (Hep3B) and showed significant cytotoxic activity against hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and this activity improved significantly when safrole oil was used in the form of a nanoemulgel. This study suggests that herbal nano-formulations containing safrole have the potential to treat oxidative stress and diabetes and can be used for cancer treatments. They can also be utilised for the development of herbal medicines or food supplements for commercial pharmaceutical use.</p>
