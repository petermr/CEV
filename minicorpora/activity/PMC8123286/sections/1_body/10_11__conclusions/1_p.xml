 <italic>Artemisia abrotanum</italic> is a species with an important position in the history of European, Middle-Eastern and Asian medicine (including especially Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)). Currently, it also has an important position in traditional European and Asian medicine (especially in the Middle East). The French Pharmacopoeia recommends the plant for use in official homeopathic medicine. In many European and Middle Eastern countries, this species is traditionally used in allopathic medicine. Recent phytochemical studies of this species have proven the variability of the chemical composition of its essential oil. Pharmacological studies, in turn, have provided evidence of new, previously unknown directions of biological activity of extracts from the herb and/or leaves, and/or essential oil of the plantâ€”antimicrobial, antioxidant, anticancer, and antiallergic effects. Some studies also indicate the possibility of using the plant in the prevention of diseases spread by insects, due to the repellent properties of the essential oil. This creates prospects for the medicinal use of the plant to an even greater extent. This species is also invariably used in the food industry as a spice and as a flavouring additive to alcoholic beverages and teas. A novelty is the possibility of using extracts from various parts of the plant in the production of cosmetics. The species is approved by the European CosIng database to be used for this purpose. In the light of contemporary research, 
 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic> appears to be an attractive species with valuable medicinal, culinary, and cosmetic qualities.
