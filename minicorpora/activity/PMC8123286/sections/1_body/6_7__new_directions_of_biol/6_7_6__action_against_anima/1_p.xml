<p>The antiparasitic activity of an ethanolic extract from the leaves of 
 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic> has been investigated in an animal model (mouse). Rodents infected with 
 <italic>Hymenolepis nana</italic> (dwarf tapeworm) or with rodent pinworms (
 <italic>Syphacia obvelata</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspiculuris tetraptera</italic>) were given the ethanolic extract from 
 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic> leaves, dissolved in water, for five consecutive days. The administration of the extract was shown to significantly reduce the egg count of all three parasites in the faeces of the mice. On the seventh day of therapy, no eggs were detected in the faeces. The research results indicate that the traditional use of 
 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic> extracts as an anti-parasitic agent has been justified [
