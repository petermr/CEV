<p>Another study determined the activity of the essential oil isolated from the herb of 
 <italic>A. abrotanum</italic> against the bacteria 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic>, and against the fungi 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, 
 <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic>. The experiment was carried out using the disk diffusion method. With 25 μL of the essential oil, the zone of growth inhibition was 19.67 mm for 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 10.33 mm for 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, 16.89 mm for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and 18.89 mm for 
 <italic>P. vulgaris</italic>. For the control with 10 μL/mL gentamicin, the zones of growth inhibition were 11 mm, 25 mm, 25 mm, and 23 mm, respectively. Among the tested fungi, the essential oil showed activity only against 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> (the growth inhibition zone was 11.89 mm after using 25 μL of a 75% solution of the essential oil diluted with Tween 40) [
