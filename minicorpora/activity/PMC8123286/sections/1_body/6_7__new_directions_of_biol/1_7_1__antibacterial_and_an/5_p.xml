 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, 
 <italic>Aspergillus ochraceus</italic>, 
 <italic>A. niger</italic> and 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> using the microdilution method. The extract showed good antibacterial properties and moderate antifungal properties against the pathogens tested. The action of quercitrin and isochlorogenic acid against the bacteria was shown to be as strong as that of streptomycin, which served as a positive control [
