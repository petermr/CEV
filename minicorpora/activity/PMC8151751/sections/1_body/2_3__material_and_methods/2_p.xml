<p>Gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography–mass spectrometric (GC–MS) analyses were performed using an Agilent 7890A GC equipped with an inert 5975C XL EI/CI mass spectrometer detector (MSD) and flame ionization detector (FID) connected by a capillary flow technology 2-way splitter with make-up. The HP-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) was used. The GC oven temperature was programmed from 60 to 300 °C at a rate of 3 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> and held for 15 min. Helium was used as the carrier gas at 16.255 psi (constant pressure mode). An auto-injection system (Agilent 7683B Series Injector - Agilent Technologies Inc, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was employed to inject 1 μL of sample. The sample was analyzed in the splitless mode. The injector temperature was 300 °C and the detector temperature 300 °C. MS data were acquired in the EI mode with a scan range of 30–550 m/z, source temperature of 230 °C, and quadruple temperature of 150 °C; the solvent delay was 3 min.
