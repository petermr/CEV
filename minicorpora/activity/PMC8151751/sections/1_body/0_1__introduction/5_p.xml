 <italic>Salmonella Tyhpi</italic> is most often the cause of typhoid fever, which is a profoundly severe intrusive bacterial disease of humans. 
 <italic>S. Tyhpi</italic> can aggressively colonize the mucosal surface of the humane digestive tract but are generally confined in healthy people by the local immune defense mechanisms. Still, 
 <italic>S. Typhi</italic> has developed the capability to propagate to deeper tissues, such as the bone marrow, spleen, and liver [

 <italic>Citrobacter koseri</italic> is the exceedingly elevated tendency to initiate brain abscesses in neonatal meningitis. Earlier reports and studies on infant rats have documented many 
 <italic>Citrobacter</italic>-filled macrophages within the ventricles and brain abscesses. It has been hypothesized that intracellular survival and replication within macrophages may be a mechanism by which 
 <italic>C. koseri</italic> subverts the host response and elicits chronic infection, resulting in brain abscess formation [
