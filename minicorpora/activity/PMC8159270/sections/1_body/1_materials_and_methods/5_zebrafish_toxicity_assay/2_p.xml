<p>To record the heartbeat frequency of each dose group, zebrafish embryos (AB strain, 48-hpf) were randomly loaded into a 24-well plate, with six embryos in each well, and each dose was consisted of two replicates. The 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic> and its vinegar-processed products of volatile oil and water decoctions were administered as different doses (10, 20, 50, 100, 200 µg/mL). A blank control group containing 0.5% DMSO was used. The working solution (750 µL) was added to each group. The heartbeat frequency of each dose group was recorded using a LEICA M165FC fluorescence microscope after 12 h and 24 h. After 12 h, different dose group deciduate embryos were placed under the slides (with a glass tank) and fixed with 4% methyl cellulose. The zebrafish position was adjusted to make both eyes and the somite overlap, and the tail and body were placed on the same horizontal plane. Photographs were collected using a stereoscopic microscope.
