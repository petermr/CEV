<p>Zebrafish embryos (FLk-GFP strain, 24-hpf), a targeted animal model for the study of angiogenesis were randomly loaded into a 24-well plate, with six embryos in each well, and each dose consisted of two duplicates. The PTU was employed as a blank control, and 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic> vinegar-processed volatile oil was added to each well using different concentrations (10, 20, 50, 100, 200 µg/mL). The working solution (750 µL) was added to each group, and the plate was placed in a constant temperature incubator for hatching. After 12 h, fluorescein angiography growth was observed under a Zeiss Inversed Fluorescent Microscope-Observer A1.
