On the second and third days, these rats received a hypodermic injection of 0.1% epinephrine hydrochloride every 4 h for a total of 2 times and then were placed in 0 °C to 2 °C ice water. After the next successful moulting, five groups, including the CR group, CV group, MR group, MV group, and MD group, received raw medicine (5.6 g/kg/day), vinegar products (5.6 g/kg/day), or compound Danshen tablets (0.5 g/kg/day) via intragastric administration.
