<p>Adult male and female, AB strain, and green fluorescent-labeled transgenic flk1-GFP zebrafish, weighing 0.25 ± 0.04 g (mean ± SEM) were obtained from Beijing Aisheng Biological Technology Co. Ltd. and bred at the Chengdu University of TCM using a zebrafish experimental platform. Zebrafish, at a 1:1 female to male ratio, were maintained in an aquarium with an automatic filtration system and covered with blue contact paper to reduce stress. The animal room was illuminated on a 14/10 h light/dark cycle, and room temperature was maintained at 25 ± 1 °C.</p>
