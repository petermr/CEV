<p>The uterine wet weight and uterine coefficient were statistically different among groups. There was a slight difference in the wet weights of the uterine among the CR, CV, and control groups. Compared to the model group, the uterine weight of the control group was markedly lower than the model group, whereas that of the MD group was significantly higher than the model group. The uterine coefficient of the model group was markedly different from the control group. In the control groups and model groups, the wet weights of the uterine among the CR are lower than CV, respectively (
