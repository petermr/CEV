<p>Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) have historically been utilised in China for the maintenance and treatment of various health conditions. Chinese medicinal processing is one of the most important pharmaceutical techniques that transforms medicinal raw materials into decoction pieces based on the theory of CHMs, which can influence dispensing, preparation and clinical applications (Chinese Pharmacopoeia Commission

 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Various processing adjuvants are usually added to herbs, including vinegar, honey, wine, brine, ginger juice, bran, and rice. Adjuvants could change therapeutic effects and reduce drug toxicity, thereby facilitating the use of CHMs for specific needs in the clinic (Zhao et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Jiang et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Vinegar is an auxiliary material, and processing with vinegar is one of the essential processing methods which was first recorded in Recipes for Fifty-Two Ailments (
 <italic>Wushi'er Bingfang</italic> in Chinese) in the Western Han Dynasty, and this method has played an increasingly important role in promoting the development of traditional Chinese medicine (Wang et al.

 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). This processing is widely used in the preparation of many herb decoctions, such as Curcumae Rhizoma (Ezhu in Chinese), Bupleuri Radix (Chaihu), Kansui Radix (Kansui) and Phytolacca Radix (Shanglu).
