<p>An approved therapeutic option for the prevention of platelet aggregation could resort to vinegar-processed 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic> (Mao et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). Intriguingly, our previous study also found that the effectiveness of 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic> has increased and its toxicity has decreased after processed with vinegar, particularly its effect on treat the stagnation of vital energy and blood stasis (Liao et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Conspicuously, the vinegar-processed 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic> have long been used in traditional Chinese medicines for blood stasis sydrome. Nevertheless, application of vinegar-processed 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic> in clinic lasts for more than a millennium owing to the multiple pharmaceutical effects, limited knowledge is available on underlying mechanisms of enhancing the therapeutic efficacy and reducing the toxicity after vinegar-processing. In our study, we adopted zebrafish as animal model to evaluate the toxicological (Ding et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Yan et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) and anti-angiogenic (Alex et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; He et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) effect. The different effects of raw 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic> and its vinegar-processed products on the embryo, heart, and blood vessels were also investigated. Subsequently, we utilised sexually mature female rats with blood stasis syndrome as another animal model. The body weight, ovary wet weight, ovary coefficient, uterus wet weight, and uterus coefficient of these indexes related to toxicity were measured to determine changes in the toxicity of raw 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic> and its vinegar-processed products.
