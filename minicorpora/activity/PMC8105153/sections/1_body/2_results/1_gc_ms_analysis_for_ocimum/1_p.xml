<p id="Par23">The hydrodistillation of 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> yielded an essential oil content of 0.5 ml/100 g of herbage. The extracted 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> EO was characterized by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectroscopy. The compounds were identified by the reported retention index. The chemical formula, molecular weight, and their chemical structures are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Fig, 1. The major components present in 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> EO were methyl chavicol (70.93%), linalool (9.34%), epi-α-cadinol (3.69 %), methyl eugenol (2.48%), γ-cadinene (1.67%), 1,8-cineole (1.30%) and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-ocimene (1.11%).
