<p id="Par29">A toxicity assay carried out showed that 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> EO topical application resulted in higher mortality over methyl chavicol and linalool to adult stages. Adults exposed to EO (LD
 <sub>50</sub> 10.01 μg/adult) were more susceptible than those exposed to methyl chavicol and linalool (LD
 <sub>50</sub> 13.62 μg/adult and LD
 <sub>50</sub> 43.12 μg/adult, respectively). Imidacloprid was more toxic (1.41 μg/adult) than EO and its constituents (Table
