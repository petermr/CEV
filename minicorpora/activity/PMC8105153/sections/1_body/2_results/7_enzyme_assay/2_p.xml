<p id="Par31">Adults exposed to linalool at LD
 <sub>50</sub> value exhibited inhibition of GST, but it was on par with control. However, LD
 <sub>50</sub> values of EO and methyl chavicol caused induction of GST levels with EO having a higher ER (4.61) than methyl chavicol (3.09) (F 
 <sub>6,14</sub> = 224.49 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .005). Topical application of EO, methyl chavicol and linalool induced the enzymes Car E in adults. In the case of Car E levels in adults, those exposed to methyl chavicol at LD
 <sub>50</sub> had Car E levels at par with control samples. Linalool had higher level of induction of Car E in adults than
