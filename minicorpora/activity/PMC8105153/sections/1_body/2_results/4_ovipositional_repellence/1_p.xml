<p id="Par26">Effective repellence (ER%) and oviposition activity index (OAI) of 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> EO and its constituentâ€™s methyl chavicol and linalool at three concentration (0.05, 0.15 and 0.25%) was determined. The ER% and OAI for EO and its constituents was concentration dependant and increased with concentration. Among the samples tested, higher oviposition deterrence to 
 <italic>M. domestica</italic> adults was observed in EO (89.52
 <underline>+</underline>1.00), methyl chavicol (80.12
 <underline>+</underline> 2.40) and linalool (78.99
 <underline>+</underline>2.93) at a dose of 0.25 % which was superior to neem oil 0.25%. EO and methyl chavicol at 0.15 % were at par in causing oviposition deterrence to 
 <italic>M. domestica</italic> adults. At a lower concentration of 0.05% the EO, methyl chavicol and linalool caused a lowest deterrence ranging from 27.83 - 35.86 % (F 
 <sub>11,36</sub> = 50.07 P &lt; 0.001). Across the concentration, neem oil caused lower oviposition deterrence.
