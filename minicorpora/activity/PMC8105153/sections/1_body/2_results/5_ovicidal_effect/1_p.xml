 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> EO and its constituent methyl chavicol and linalool were evaluated for ovicidal activity. 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> EO had 5.8-fold higher ovicidal activity (EC
 <sub>50</sub> 9.74 mg/dm
 <sup>3</sup>) on 
 <italic>M. domestica</italic> eggs than linalool (EC
 <sub>50</sub> 13.57 mg/dm
 <sup>3</sup>). Among the constituents, methyl chavicol elicited 1.27-fold higher toxicity than linalool (EC
 <sub>50</sub> 10.67 mg/dm
 <sup>3</sup>). The ovicidal activity of DDVP was superior to (EC
 <sub>50</sub> 390.37 mg/dm
 <sup>3</sup>) EO and its constituents (Table
