<p id="Par5">The reports on basil EO and its constituents, linalool and methyl chavicol were limited to fumigant and contact toxicity to adults and larval stages of 
 <italic>M. domestica</italic> (Palacios et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2009</xref>; Tian 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2017</xref>). In our studies, we focused on the electrophysiological and olfactory response of 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> EO and its major constituents to adult females of 
 <italic>M. domestica</italic>. Furthermore, we investigated the ovicidal, adulticidal and the activity of detoxification enzyme in adult exposed to 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> EO, linalool and methyl chavicol.
