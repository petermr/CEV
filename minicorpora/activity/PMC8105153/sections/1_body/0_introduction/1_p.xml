<p id="Par2">The cosmopolitan housefly, 
 <italic>Musca domestica</italic> L. (Diptera: Muscidae), is synanotrophic and lives in close association with humans and livestock causing annoyance, food spoilage and pathogen transmission (causing enteric disease, typhoid, and shigellosis) (Sasaki et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2000</xref>; Kumar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2012</xref>; Khamesipour et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2018</xref>; Moon 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2019</xref>). The transmission of microbes is facilitated through fecal, body, and regurgitation routes (Fotedar

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2007</xref>; Wanaratana et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2013</xref>). The ability of houseflies to acquire avian influenza H9N2 may aid in spreading spreading the virus to humans and poultry (Salamatian et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2020</xref>). Reports from Wuhan confirmed 2â€“10% of COVID-19 patients had diarrhoea and abdominal pain, a symptom that could have occurred due to faecal-oral transmission (Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2020</xref>). In such a situation, vectoral role of flies carrying virus from faecal visits to human settlements cannot be ruled out (Dehghani and Kassiri
