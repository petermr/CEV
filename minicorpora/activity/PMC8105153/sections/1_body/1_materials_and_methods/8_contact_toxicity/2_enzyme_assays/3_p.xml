<p id="Par17">The activity of carboxylesterases (Car E) was determined using the method suggested by Li et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2007</xref>). The reaction mixture consisting of 15 μl of enzyme homogenate made up to 500 ul with sodium phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) and 800 μl α- naphthyl acetate (dissolved in acetone, prepared in PO
 <sub>4</sub> buffer) was incubated in dark condition for 20 min. The control mix had 800 μl of substrate and 500 μl of phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4). Formation of blue colour on addition of 200 μl of staining solution indicated the production of α-napthol. The absorbance was measured at 595 nm using microplate reader (iMark, BioRad). Enzyme activity in the sample was calibrated using α-napthol standard curve.
