<p id="Par15">The surviving flies after treatment with LC
 <sub>50</sub> doses of EO, methyl chavicol and linalool (9,98, 13.62 and 43.13 μg/adult, respectively) were used for the extraction of whole-body homogenate. Acetone-treated adults were used as control. The flies were homogenised in ice cold 50-mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Homogenates were centrifuged at 4 
 <sup>o</sup>C for 20 min at 10,000 rpm. The supernatant was subjected to protein estimation using Bradford’s method (Bradford 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1976</xref>) and used as an enzyme source for the estimation of carboxylesterase (CarE) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities.
