 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2007</xref>). The components in reaction mixture include 30 μl of enzyme solution, 10 μl each of reduced glutathione (GSH) and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) (dissolved in ethanol and prepared with 50 mM po4 buffer, PH 7.4) and 950 μl phosphate buffer. Control mixture had 10 μl each of GSH and1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and 950 or 980 μl of phosphate buffer. The rate of change in absorbance at 340 nm was measured for 5 min in 96-well microplate reader and converted to specific activity using extinction coefficient of 9.6 mM
