<p id="Par14">Acute toxicity of EO, methyl chavicol and linalool to female 
 <italic>M. domestica</italic> was assessed by topical application. Acetone was used as a solvent to prepare varying concentration of EO, methyl chavicol and linalool. Acetone alone was maintained as negative control and imidacloprid was used as positive control. Preliminary range finding test was done to fix the doses. Two-day-old adult female flies were immobilized using CO
 <sub>2.</sub> The flies were transferred to flat surface, and 1 Î¼l of the test compounds were placed on the pronota using a microapplicator. The treated adults were transferred to an insect breeding dish (Himedia) having ventilation in the lid. The adults had access to 10% honey solution soaked in absorbent cotton. Four replications were maintained per treatment. Mortality was assessed 24 h after the treatment. Those flies that ceased to move its appendages in mild pin prick were considered dead (Subaharan et al.
