<p id="Par12">Gravid 
 <italic>M. domestica</italic> females (10 Nos.) housed in cage (30 × 30 × 30 cm) made of aluminium frame having acrylic sheets were exposed to 2 g of oviposition substrate (wheat bran + milk powder + egg yolk powder (10: 2: 1) treated with EO, methyl chavicol, linalool and neem oil dissolved in acetone so as to achieve 0.05, 0.15 and 0.25% concentrations. Oviposition substrate treated with acetone alone was maintained as control. In both the cases, the solvent was allowed to evaporate from the oviposition substrate prior to their placement in treated and control dish that were placed at diagonal ends in the floor of the cage. Four replications were maintained (One cage per replicate). The number of eggs laid were counted after 24 h. The percent effective repellency (ER%) and Oviposition Activity Index (OAI) for flies exposed to EO, linalool, methyl chavicol and neem oil were calculated.
