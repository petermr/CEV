 <italic>M. domestica</italic> eggs (0–3 h) were collected using a soft paint brush. Twenty eggs of 
 <italic>M. domestica</italic> were placed in the base of the 50-ml plastic sample container (Tarsons) having screw cap lid. Sweet basil EO, methyl chavicol and linalool of varied concentration ranging from 0.5 to 79 mg/dm
 <sup>3</sup> were applied to filter paper attached to the base of the lid. Acetone alone was maintained as control and DDVP was maintained as positive control. This setup was sealed tightly using a parafilm and placed in incubator at 28 ± 2 °C and RH 65 ± 5%. The number of hatched and unhatched eggs were counted after 48 h. The experiments were replicated for five times.
