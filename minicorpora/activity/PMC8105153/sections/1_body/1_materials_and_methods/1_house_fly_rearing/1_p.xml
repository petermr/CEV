<p id="Par6">House fly, 
 <italic>M. domestica</italic> adults were collected using a sweep net from suburbs of Bengaluru, India. The collected adult flies were kept in 30×30×30 cm cage (aluminium frame fitted with acrylic sheets). The flies were fed with diluted honey solution (10%) in water. An oviposition substrate (250 gm) prepared by mixing wheat bran + milk powder + egg yolk powder (10: 2: 1) with water was placed in the cage to facilitate the mated flies to lay their eggs. The larvae on hatching continued to feed on wheat bran medium. When the larvae in the medium reached third instar, ragi (
 <italic>Elusine coracona</italic>) husk was added to the dry larval medium to facilitate pupation. The fly rearing unit was maintained at 28 ± 2 °C, RH 65 ± 5%. The bio stages (eggs 0–3 h old and 2–3 days old adult females) of the flies collected from the rearing chamber were used in experiments.
