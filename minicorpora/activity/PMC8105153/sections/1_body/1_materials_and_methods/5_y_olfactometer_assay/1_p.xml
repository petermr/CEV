<p id="Par11">The olfactory response of 2–3 days old adult females to sweet basil EO its constituent methyl chavicol, linalool and neem oil was evaluated using a glass Y-tube olfactometer having a main arm of 17 cm and choice arms of 17 cm with an inner diameter of 4 cm. Atmospheric air pumped using an air sampler was allowed to flow out through activated charcoal cartridge with a flow rate of 0.5 L/min. The purified air was then let into the arms of the Y-tube with steady flow rate. Whatman No. 1 filter paper stripes (3 cm length and 0.5 cm width) were treated with 200 μL of 20% sugar solution and dried for 30 min. To this 10 μL of 100 ppm of odorants diluted in dichloromethane was loaded, and the paper strips were allowed to dry in room temperature for 10 min to permit the solvent to evaporate. The paper strips prepared as mentioned above without the odorants was used as control. Both treated and control paper strips were inserted into an odour tube that was connected between the air flow tube and the Y-tube arm. The entire Y-tube setup was placed inclined at 20°. Pairwise comparison was made between odorants and control. The adult female flies were starved for 4 h with water satiation prior to test. A total of 100 female flies (
 <italic>N</italic> = 100) were introduced into the main arm. The choice made by the flies in an arm was considered if they crossed the halfway mark made in the arm in 3 min of start of the test. Those flies that failed to participate in the test were considered non-respondents. The odorants were switched between the arms to avoid position effect. The test was conducted at room temperature of 25 ± 2 °C under red light with slight modification as suggested by Ravindran et al. (
