 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> (300 g) were extracted by hydro-distillation in a Clevenger type apparatus to obtain EO. The leaves along with 500 ml of water were loaded into a round bottom flask placed over a heating mantle. The contents in the flask were heated to 100 °C. The oil along with water collected in the receiver tube was phase separated using a separating funnel. The collected essential oil was dried by passing over anhydrous sodium sulphate to remove the moisture trace and stored in amber vials at 4 °C until use.
