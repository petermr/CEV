 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> oil was characterized using GC-MS (Agilent GC- 7890A (G3440A) and MS- G3171A 5975) as suggested by Ravindran et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2019</xref>). One μl of 0.01% essential oil diluted in dichloromethane was introduced by microsyringe into injector port attached to HP-5 MS Phenylmethylsilox capillary column (30 m × 250 μm i.d. × 0.25 μm film thickness, Agilent Technologies, USA) through a glass liner. The oven and column temperature were maintained at 40 °C for 1 min and then raised at the rate of 20 °C per minute to 280 °C. The temperature during the post run was held at 300 °C for 10 min. The temperature in injector and detector was maintained at 250 °C. The total run was for 23 min. In MS, the ion source temperature was set at 250 °C. The flow rate of the carrier gas Helium was maintained at 1 ml per minute. An electron ionization (EI) mode with 70 eV ionization energy was used for the GC–MS identification. Identification of the components in EO was done by considering the relative peak percent area, retention time and mass fragmentation pattern using the NIST library. Major constituents in oil were verified by co injecting the compounds.
