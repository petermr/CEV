<p id="Par32">Indiscriminate use of chemicals has led to development of insecticide resistance and negative effects to consumers. There is a growing demand for environmentally safe pesticides to manage 
 <italic>M. domestica</italic>. Essential oils (EO) derived from plant parts contain bioactive compounds that can be used in isolation or in combination for managing pests of agriculture, medical and veterinary importance (Isman

 <italic>M. domestica</italic> was reported earlier (Pavela
