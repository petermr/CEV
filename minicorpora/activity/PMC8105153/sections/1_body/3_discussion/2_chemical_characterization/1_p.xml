<p id="Par33">In our study, sweet basil EO contained methyl chavicol (70.93 %) and linalool (9.34%) as major constituents
 <italic>.</italic> This agrees with earlier reports mentioning methyl chavicol, linalool, Î²-elemene and camphor as major constituents of basil oil (Sonmezdag et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2018</xref>). The proportion of the constituents in basil oil varies according to the plant chemotype (Telci et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2006</xref>; Ogendo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2008</xref>), such as methyl chavicol, linalool, methyl eugenol and methyl cinnamate types (Lawrence 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1998</xref>). The EO of 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> in our study contained thirty components, accounting for 99.31% of the total composition. As the EO used in our study had a higher load of methyl chavicol (70.93%), it could be considered a methyl chavicol chemotype as proposed by Varga et al. (
