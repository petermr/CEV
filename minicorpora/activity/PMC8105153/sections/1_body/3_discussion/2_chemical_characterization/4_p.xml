<p id="Par36">Cages having oviposition substrate treated with 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> EO and its components methyl chavicol and linalool at 0.25% showed highest ovipositional repellence against 
 <italic>M. domestica</italic> with values ranging from 79 to 89 % and an OAI of −0.65 to −0.67
 <italic>.</italic> Essential oil of 
 <italic>O. gratissimum</italic> at 2% also caused 100% repellent activity against 
 <italic>M. domestica</italic> (Singh and Singh 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">1991</xref>). The repellence of essential oil against 
 <italic>M. domestica</italic> has impact on the population build up (Maganga et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">1996</xref>). The toxic effects of 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic>, EO and its constituent’s methyl chavicol and linalool to larval, pupal and adult stages of 
 <italic>M. domestica</italic> has been documented (Pavela 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2008b</xref>; Tarelli et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2009</xref>; Scalerandi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2018</xref>). Identifying the essential oil with ovicidal activity can contain the pest buildup (Hong et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2018</xref>). Eggs of 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>domestica</italic> are easier to target than motile larval and adult stages. 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> EO had 5.8-fold higher ovicidal activity on 
 <italic>M. domestica</italic> eggs than its constituent’s linalool or methyl chavicol. Eggs of mosquito vectors, 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, 
 <italic>Anopheles dirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> exposed to 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> oil had extremely low hatch rates (EC
 <sub>50</sub> &lt; 1.9%) (Siriporn and Mayura 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2012</xref>) 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> oil at 1.0 ml/ 38.5 ml of air caused 100% mortality of 
 <italic>Callosobruchus chinensis</italic> (L.) 3 days after the exposure period (Abd El-Salam 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2010</xref>), and linalool also showed ovicidal activity against the eggs of insecticide resistant lice BR-HL females (Yang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2009</xref>). Transgenic 
 <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic> producing higher levels of linalool were not preferred for oviposition by 
 <italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic> as linalool was reported to cause repellence (McCallum et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2011</xref>).
