<p id="Par35">Compounds that result in a physiological response in antennae need not be behaviorally active, hence an olfactory assay must be performed to establish the behavioral response (Ravindran et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2019</xref>). In the Y-tube olfactory assay, the adults of 
 <italic>M. domestica</italic> preferred the control arm containing a food source alone over the arm having food source laced with sweet basil EO and methyl chavicol. This aversive response of 
 <italic>M. domestica</italic> adults to EO and methyl chavicol may be due to its ability to perceive the odorants in antennae. The peripheral response of antennal neurons to EO and methyl chavicol in EAG provides a physiological basis for the aversive olfactory mediated behaviour in Y- tube assay. The essential oils of 
 <italic>Ocimum gratissimum</italic>, 
 <italic>Thymus serpyllum, Myristica fragrans</italic> and 
 <italic>Curcuma amada</italic> caused 100% repellence to housefly for a duration of 5 h. (Singh and Singh 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">1991</xref>). Vanillin, p-menthane-3,8-diol (PMD) and neem oil at 5% caused significant repellence to 
 <italic>M. domestica</italic> adults (Khater and Geden 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2019</xref>). Combinations of EOs, viz., 
 <italic>Chrysopogon zizanioides</italic>, 
 <italic>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic> along with sunflower oil caused repellence to the blow fly 
 <italic>Lucilia sericata</italic> (Khater and Geden 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2019</xref>). Methyl chavicol, a constituent in 
 <italic>Tagetes filifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>O. selloi</italic>, was also found to be repellent to 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (Diptera) (Gleiser et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2011</xref>) and 
 <italic>Anopheles braziliensis</italic> (Diptera) (Padilha de Paula et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2003</xref>). Sadeh et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2019</xref>) reported that rosemary variety 11 having 0.6â€“0.9 % methyl chavicol elicited repellency to whitefly, 
 <italic>Bemesia tabaci</italic>. Hobson Kenneth (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1995</xref>) further reported that methyl chavicol reduced the aggregation of 
 <italic>Dendroctonus</italic> beetles. Repellents prevent the orientation/alighting of houseflies on treated surfaces and can therefore reduce the spread of diseases in locations where the housefly is high (Haselton et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2015</xref>). Identifying repellents for the house fly is of paramount importance because of its negative impacts on agriculture and human health (Malik et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2007</xref>). Assessing the repellents of bioactive compounds to flies in small space using olfactometers is difficult to arrive at a conclusion. The behavioural response involving cage studies will facilitate to confirm the response in Y-tube olfactory assays (Khater and Geden 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2019</xref>).
