<p id="Par40">The work in this study has demonstrated the bioactive potential of 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> EO and its constituents, methyl chavicol and linalool in toxicity to eggs and adult stage. The electrophysiological and behavioral response of adult female flies to EO and its constituents by inducing repellence and ovipositional deterrence in adults can be used to deter fly populations from infesting human settlements and animal sheds. 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> EO as whole induces a higher ovicidal, adulticidal and repellency to flies, and these traits make it fit for integrated pest management (IPM) of 
 <italic>M. domestica.</italic> Further studies are needed to develop a formulation of 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> EO for sustained spatiotemporal release rates as there is a market demand for plant-derived parts for managing the pests like 
 <italic>M. domestica</italic>.
