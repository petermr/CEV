<p id="Par37">We observed that topical application of 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> EO was more toxic than methyl chavicol and linalool to adult stages of 
 <italic>M. domestica</italic>. Increased toxicity in EO may be due to the combined effect of the compounds in natural oil as reported by Cheng et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2009</xref>). In contrast, methyl chavicol (11.01 ppm) and linalool (35.17 ppm) in isolation had higher larvicidal activity than 
 <italic>Clausena anisate</italic> EO as a whole (LC
 <sub>50</sub> 119.59 ppm) (Govindarajan

 <italic>Chrysopogon zizanioides</italic>, 
 <italic>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic> (0.6%) caused 100% mortality of adult 
 <italic>M. domestica</italic> by topical and fumigant exposure (Khater and Geden 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2019</xref>). The lipophilicity coupled with low molecular weight of EOs enable them to show various modes of action on insects (Pavela and Benelli 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2016</xref>). The structure and functional group of terpenoids facilitates their entry into the insect cuticle and attach to the target site to bring in desirable bioaction (Rice and Coats
