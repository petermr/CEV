<p id="Par34">In our study, the EAG assay revealed that the neuronal response of the antennae of adult female 
 <italic>M. domestica</italic> was higher to sweet basil EO and methyl chavicol followed by linalool and neem oil. As EAG response is linked to insect olfaction (Ghabbari et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2018</xref>) higher amplitude of response trace to EO and methyl chavicol may be due to higher number of receptors in antennal neuron to these stimuli that may influence the flyâ€™s behaviour. Basil oil when presented at 100 ng produced a mean antennal response of 0.99 mv in the coconut rhinoceros beetle, 
 <italic>Oryctes rhinoceros</italic> (Ravindran et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2019</xref>). White and Hobson (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">1993</xref>) reported that methyl chavicol elicited an EAG response in the mountain pine beetle. Methyl chavicol was reported as a antiaggregant to bark beetles. When methyl chavicol was mixed with attractive bait, it reduced the attraction of Western pine beetle, 
 <italic>Dendroctonus brevicomis</italic> and mountain pine beetle, 
 <italic>D.ponderosae</italic> by 60 and 68%, respectively (Hobson Kenneth 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1995</xref>). Screening of the odorants for antennal response using EAG provides a lead to select the compounds for behavioural assays (Cosse et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1995</xref>; Zito et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2013</xref>; Ruschioni et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2015</xref>) as the EAG active compounds in the essential oils could elicit attractive or repulsive behavioural response (Meza et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2020</xref>)
