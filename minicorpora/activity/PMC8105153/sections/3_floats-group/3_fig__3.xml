  <p>Behavioural response of adult female 
   <italic>M. domestica</italic> in a two choice Y- olfactometer (Per cent repelled n = 100). Starved adult female flies were offered a choice between treated arm (Food source with sweet basil EO and its constituentsâ€™ methyl chavicol, linalool and neem oil) and control arm (Food source alone). Both bars represent the per cent flies orienting to treated and control arm. The non-responding adult female flies were presented in right hand side (No choice %). Asterisks show a preference that was significantly different (binomial test) from a 50:50 distribution: * = 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05. The flies that failed to respond were excluded from the statistical analysis
