  <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> essential oil (EO) was evaluated for its biological effects on 
  <italic>M. domestica</italic>. Characterization of 
  <italic>O. basilicum</italic> EO revealed the presence of methyl chavicol (70.93%), linalool (9.34%), epi-α-cadinol (3.69 %), methyl eugenol (2.48%), γ-cadinene (1.67%), 1,8-cineole (1.30%) and (
  <italic>E</italic>)-β-ocimene (1.11%). The basil EO and its constituents methyl chavicol and linalool elicited a neuronal response in female adults of 
  <italic>M. domestica</italic>. Adult female flies showed reduced preference to food source laced with basil EO and methyl chavicol. Substrates treated with EO and methyl chavicol at 0.25% resulted in an oviposition deterrence of over 80%. A large ovicidal effect was found for 
  <italic>O. basilicum</italic> EO (EC
  <sub>50</sub> 9.74 mg/dm
  <sup>3</sup>) followed by methyl chavicol (EC
  <sub>50</sub> 10.67 mg/dm
  <sup>3</sup>) and linalool (EC
  <sub>50</sub> 13.57 mg/dm
  <sup>3</sup>). Adults exposed to EO (LD
  <sub>50</sub> 10.01 μg/adult) were more susceptible to contact toxicity than to methyl chavicol and linalool (LD
  <sub>50</sub> 13.62 μg/adult and LD
  <sub>50</sub> 43.12 μg/adult respectively). EO and its constituents methyl chavicol and linalool also induced the detoxifying enzymes Carboxyl esterase (Car E) and Glutathione S – transferases (GST).
