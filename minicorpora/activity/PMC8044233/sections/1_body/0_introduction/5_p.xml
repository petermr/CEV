<p id="Par6">In addition to the importance of substrates properties in the hydroponic culture system, attention to the chemical composition of nutrient solution is important

 </sup>. In terms of chemical composition of nutrient solutions, two major inorganic forms of nitrogen (N), the NH
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> and the NO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>, can differentially impact the various plant properties, based on the plant species
 <sup>

 </sup>. Although the assimilation and metabolism of NH
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> form require less energy than that of NO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>−</sup> in plants, the majority of plant species grow better on NO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>−</sup> since NH
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> is toxic for plants and a few species grow well if NH
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> is the only source of N
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>. The plant species and environmental conditions are two critical factors that affect the optimum NO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>/NH
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> ratio

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>
 </sup>. Previous researches also demonstrated that the inorganic N application rate and sources could affect the essential oil content of sweet basil (
