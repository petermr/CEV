<p id="Par14">Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS) spectra were recorded on a Varian-3400 model fitted with a fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d.) coated with 0.25 µm film. The GC was run from 60 to 250 °C at a programmed rate of 8 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup>, hold at 100 °C for 2 min, using He as the carrier gas at a pressure of 1.6 kg cm
 <sup>−2</sup> and injector temperature of 250 °C. The GC column was coupled directly to the quadrupole mass spectrometer operated in the electron impact (EI) mode at 70 eV. Mass spectra were recorded at a scan speed of 9 at m/z 700–10.
