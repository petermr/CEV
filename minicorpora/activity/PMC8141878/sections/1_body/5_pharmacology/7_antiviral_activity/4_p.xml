<p id="p0220">The human immuno deficiency virus is another STD which has no available vaccine yet. A study conducted by Feriotto et al. (2018) targeted the Tat protein that aids in the transcription of the viral genome. This study evaluated the interaction of the essential oil from 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. with the transcription of the Tat/TAR-RNA complex as well as the Tat-induced HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) [

 <sub>50</sub> = 0,83 μg/ml, a notable inhibitory potential which reduced viral transcription to 52% (p &lt; 0.05) [

 <sub>50</sub>) on PBMC was found to be 200 μg/ml. Further, the antiviral assay revealed EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of &gt;500 μg/ml. The study also focused on CD4+ expressions, where mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of the cells was found to be 22.72 in PBMC (p &lt; 0.05) [
