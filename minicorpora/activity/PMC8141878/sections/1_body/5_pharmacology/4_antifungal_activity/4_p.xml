<p id="p0165">It is noteworthy that a majority of the studies have performed both fungistatic and fungicidal assessments which determine the complete inhibition of fungi. A few of the studies have performed the time kill assay and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> inhibition assays to effectively determine the antifungal activity [

 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The literature search was not able to find the antifungal studies completed using water and alcohol extracts. Also, there is a lack in antifungal studies performed, using the extracts and compounds on MDR species. The fungal resistance needs to be dealt with using variable number of doses of the extracts along with concerns regarding its cytotoxicity on the living cells. Furthermore, there is a lack of information on the fungicidal and fungistatic mechanism of the plant extracts and essential oil [

 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Owing to a lack of studies on host-pathogen interaction, advanced studies to decipher this mechanism should be carried out in order to identify the optimal dose. These studies must evaluate the cytotoxic effects as well as cell survivability so that clinical trials using plant fractions could be performed.
