<p id="p0280">Many of the studies quoted in this review need to be modified in terms of their methodology. Antimicrobial evaluations need a reformation, where the zone of inhibition could be excluded. Metabolic approaches like enzyme inhibition, protein inactivation, and interference in DNA and protein biosynthesis could be carried out. These mechanisms support the specific drug discovery process. In case of antioxidant activity, conventional assays like DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP need to be excluded, as advancements including evaluation of cytokine factors and antioxidant enzymes have been a major concern in recent years. Herein, the use of 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> approach in support to the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> findings needs to be focused. Evaluations require animal model and cell lines with drug-induced autoimmunity. As the inflammation is concerned with several signalling pathways and immune cells, the fate of these cells and pathways need to be studied upon the introduction of plant fractions. Anti-cancerous studies need to include animal model and more 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> approaches than cell lines, along with a dose-dependent approach using individual compounds.
