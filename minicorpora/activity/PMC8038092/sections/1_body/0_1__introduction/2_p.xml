<p>As a member of the Inuleae-Inulinae subtribe, the genus 
 <italic>Carpesium</italic> is a close relative to such essential oil-bearing plants as 
 <italic>Inula helenium</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Telekia speciosa</italic> (Schreb.) Baumg. [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-26-01883" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Although many studies on isolation of mono- and sesquiterpenoids from 
 <italic>C. cernuum</italic> have been published before [

 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-01883" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], data on composition of essential oils produced by the plant are not available. Essential oil from the herb of 
 <italic>Carpesium abrotanoides</italic> L. was shown to induce apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-01883" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, only 16 components of the examined oil were identified, and the established composition was significantly different from that described earlier [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-01883" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A detailed analysis of essential oils from roots and aerial parts of 
 <italic>Carpesium divaricatum</italic> Sieb. &amp; Zucc. has been published recently [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-01883" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], revealing the presence of numerous thymol derivatives, especially in the oil from roots of the plant.
