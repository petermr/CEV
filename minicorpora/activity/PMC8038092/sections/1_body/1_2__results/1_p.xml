<p>Though yields of the essential oil produced by aerial parts of 
 <italic>C. cernuum</italic> were low (0.015 ± 0.002%; see 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-01883-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), 115 components of the oil, distilled from shoots of the plant collected at the beginning of flowering time, were identified by GC-MS. The identification was supported by NMR spectra analysis of the corresponding components isolated from the 
 <italic>C. cernuum</italic> root essential oil. The identified compounds constituted 97.7% of the analyzed oil. Three compounds: α-pinene—the predominant constituent (35%, 
 <bold>3</bold>), 2,5-dimethoxy-
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (thymohydroquinone dimethyl ether, 12%, 
 <bold>80</bold>) and linalool (4%, 
 <bold>30</bold>) (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01883-f001">Figure 1</xref>) made up about 50% of the essential oil distilled from aerial parts of the plant. Eleven structurally diverse thymol derivatives (
 <bold>55</bold>, 
 <bold>80</bold>, 
 <bold>88</bold>, 
 <bold>89</bold>, 
 <bold>114</bold>, 
 <bold>115</bold>, 
 <bold>120</bold>, 
 <bold>121</bold>, 
 <bold>126</bold>, 
 <bold>127</bold> and 
 <bold>129</bold>) composed about 20% of the oil. Structures of six constituents of the essential oil remained unknown. The constituents could not be isolated and spectroscopically analyzed due to their minute amounts in the plant material.
