<p>High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to detect the aflatoxin content during a storage period. The method of the 2015 edition of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia was used as a reference for the extraction of aflatoxins (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">National Pharmacopoeia Commission, 2015</xref>). The liquid phase conditions were as follows: the mobile phase was methanol:acetonitrile:water (40:18:42), and detection was performed by post column derivatization. The flow rate of the derivatization pump was 0.3 mL⋅min
 <sup>–1</sup>, and the derivatization temperature was 70°C. A photochemical derivatizer (245 nm) was used. The excitation wavelength was 360 nm, and the emission wavelength was 450 nm.
