<p>After fumigation with the EO for 7 days, the treated and control groups were first placed in 4% glutaraldehyde at 4°C overnight and rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered solution (0.1 M, pH 7.0) for 20 min each time. Gradient ethanol solution (20–100%, 10% intervals) was used to dehydrate the samples for 20 min each time (100% ethanol solution was rinsed for 30 min each time three times). The dried samples were observed under a stereomicroscope, and a small number of samples were sprayed with gold for scanning electron microscopy examination.</p>
