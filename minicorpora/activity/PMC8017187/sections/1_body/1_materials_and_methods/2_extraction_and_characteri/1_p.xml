<p>The EO was obtained by hydrodistillation and stored in a brown sealed bottle at 4°C for use. The EO components were characterized by gas chromatography–mass spectrometer (GC-MS). The chromatographic column was HP-5 MS 5% phenyl methyl siloxane (0.25 mm × 30 mm × 0.25 mm). The initial temperature was 50°C, and the temperature was increased to 100°C at a rate of 3°C⋅min
 <sup>–1</sup> and maintained for 3 min. Then, the temperature was increased to 240°C at a rate of 5°C⋅min
 <sup>–1</sup> and maintained for 5 min. The carrier gas was He, the flow rate was 1.0 mL⋅min
 <sup>–1</sup>, the split ratio was 30:1, the gasification temperature was 250°C, and the solvent delay was 4 min. The electron energy was 70 eV, the ion source temperature was 270°C, and the mass range
