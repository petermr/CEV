<p>Fifty milliliters of potato dextrose broth (PDB) medium at room temperature after sterilization was obtained, and an appropriate amount of the EO was prepared with Tween at concentrations of 0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1 μL⋅mL
 <sup>–1</sup>. At the same time, 200 μL of 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> spore suspension with a concentration of 2 × 10
 <sup>–7</sup> cfu⋅mL
 <sup>–1</sup> was inoculated into the liquid culture medium and incubated at 120 rpm at 28 ± 0.5°C for 7 days. Each experiment was repeated three times. The mycelium were collected by vacuum filtration and dried to a constant weight, and the weight of the mycelium was measured to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).
