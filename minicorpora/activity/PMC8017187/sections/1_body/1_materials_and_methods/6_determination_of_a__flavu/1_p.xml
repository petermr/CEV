<p>The surface-disinfected platycladi semen containing 100 μL of 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> spore suspension on the surface was placed in a sterile culture dish, and the EO was dripped onto sterile circular filter paper (2 cm) and adhered to the top of it. The control group was treated with the same volume of sterile distilled water on the dish, and dimethyl sulfoxide solution was used as the negative control group. The same batch of platycladi semen without any treatment was selected as the blank group. Each group was performed with three repetitions and placed at 20 and 4°C for culture, and the number of 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> was counted at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 days.
