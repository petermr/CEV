<p>In a previous report, the plate fumigation method was used to study the antifungal activity of an EO. After 7 days of cultivation, no growth of 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> was found on the plate (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Li T. et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, MIC was determined by PDB liquid medium. The EO at different concentrations was dropped into PDB medium containing a certain concentration of 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> spore suspension. After 7 days of incubation, it was found that a large number of mycelial spherules appeared in PDB with concentrations of 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.1, and 0.2 μL⋅mL
 <sup>–1</sup>, whereas aseptic silk balls appeared in bottles with concentrations of 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1 μL⋅mL
 <sup>–1</sup>, but the medium was slightly turbid. After ANOVA, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, there were significant differences among the EO concentrations of 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1 μL⋅mL
 <sup>–1</sup>, and the dry weight of mycelium reached the minimum at the concentration of 0.8 μL⋅mL
 <sup>–1</sup>, so the MIC of the EO was determined to be 0.8 μL⋅mL
 <sup>–1</sup>.
