<p>The results of HPLC and database analysis are shown in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. When platycladi semen was obtained from the market, the results showed that the content of AFB1 was 0.45 μg⋅kg
 <sup>–1</sup>, and the total content of aflatoxin (sum of AFB1, AFB2, AFG1, AFG2) was 0.57 μg⋅kg
 <sup>–1</sup>. Aflatoxins were monitored after storage for a period of time. On the 10th day, the aflatoxin content in the two groups did not change much. The content of AFB1 in the EO group reached 0.44 μg⋅kg
 <sup>–1</sup>, and the total content was 0.57 μg⋅kg
 <sup>–1</sup>, whereas the content of AFB1 in the control group reached 1.45 μg⋅kg
 <sup>–1</sup>, and the total content reached 2.64 μg⋅kg
 <sup>–1</sup>. On the 100th day of storage, the aflatoxin content in the two groups increased significantly. The content of AFB1 in the EO group reached 2.28 μg⋅kg
 <sup>–1</sup>, and the total content was 2.77 μg⋅kg
 <sup>–1</sup>, whereas the content of AFB1 in the control group reached 6.84 μg⋅kg
 <sup>–1</sup> [the content exceeded the limit of pharmacopeia (≤5 μg⋅kg
 <sup>–1</sup>)] (
