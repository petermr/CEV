<p>A stereomicroscope was used to observe the morphology of platycladi semen with 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> attached after EO and sterile water treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). The mycelium of 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> fumigated by EO was light yellow after 7 days, the mycelial shrinkage was visible as destruction, and the growth was slow. However, 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> in the control group was yellow-green, with a large number of granules on the surface, and grew vigorously. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the morphology of 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> after fumigation with the EO group and control group was very different (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). In the control group, a large number of plump mycelia covered the surface of the platycladi semen, and the mycelium was rod-shaped and smooth. However, the mycelium on the surface of platycladi semen with EO was less abundant, and irregular shrinkage appeared. These findings were similar to those observed in earlier reports (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2016</xref>). It is speculated that the EO of 
 <italic>Z. armatum</italic> DC. may damage the growth of mycelium and inhibit 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic>.
