<p>For the fumigation of the EO under the two different conditions, room temperature 20°C and cold temperature 4°C, the changes in 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> colony number on the surface of platycladi semen are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>. It can be seen that the growth of 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> on the surface of platycladi semen under cold storage conditions was inhibited relative to that under room temperature conditions, so fumigation with EO under cold storage conditions is more effective.
