<p>At room temperature, no visible 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> appeared on the surface of platycladi semen at the beginning of each group. As the incubation time increased, on the seventh day, the negative control group and control group clearly showed the growth of 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> on the surface of platycladi semen. A small amount of 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> was visible on the surface of platycladi semen in the EO group, whereas no 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> adhesion was observed on the surface of each group of samples under cold storage condition (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). After incubation, the number of 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> colonies on the surface of platycladi semen was counted (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). At room temperature, it can be seen that except for the EO group, which showed an upward trend in the number of 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> colonies after 4 days, the number of 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> colonies in the other groups demonstrated an upward trend at 2 days and reached the maximum value at 4–6 days; that is, 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> could be seen growing on the whole plate. Similarly, under cold storage, the blank group, negative control group, and control group showed an upward trend. Compared with these groups, the number of 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> was almost the lowest in the EO group, and only an average colony number of 44.44 cfu⋅g
 <sup>–1</sup> was detected. This indicates that the EO under cold storage can effectively inhibit 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic>, suggesting that it can be used as a new type of antifungal agent during the storage of platycladi semen.
