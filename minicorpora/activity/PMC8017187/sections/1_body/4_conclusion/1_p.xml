<p>To evaluate the application prospects of the EO from 
 <italic>Z. armatum</italic> DC. on 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> in stored platycladi semen, the inhibition efficiency of the EO on fungal morphology, colony number, and mycotoxin production was evaluated using stereomicroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, plate counting, and HPLC. When the EO was treated with platycladi semen, we found that the EO could destroy the hyphae of 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> and greatly reduce the number of colonies in the stored platycladi semen. Moreover, the EO had the best antifungal effect under cold storage conditions. In addition, EO can extend the storage time of platycladi semen, and the aflatoxin B1 content did not exceed the standard within 100 days. These findings provide substantial solid evidence for the successful application of EO from 
 <italic>Z. armatum</italic> DC. to control toxigenic fungi and subsequent mycotoxin contamination during storage.
