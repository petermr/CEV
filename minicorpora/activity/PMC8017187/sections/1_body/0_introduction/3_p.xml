<p>Chemical fungicides were previously considered to be the most effective way to prevent the growth of 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> during the storage of medicinal materials. Recent studies have shown that chemical fungicides have a series of safety problems, such as teratogenicity, carcinogenesis, induced pathogen resistance, increased toxin production, and a long degradation cycle (
