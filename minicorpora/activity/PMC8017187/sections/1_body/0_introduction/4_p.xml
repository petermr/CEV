<p>Essential oils are a good source of several bioactive compounds that possess antioxidative and antimicrobial properties (

 <italic>A. flavus</italic> by EO during the storage of platycladi semen. In our previous studies, the EO of 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum armatum</italic> DC. was selected among 16 kinds of plant EOs and could significantly inhibit the growth of 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> (

 <italic>Z. armatum</italic> DC., a plant of Zanthoxylum in Rutaceae, is an important spice and Chinese medicinal material (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2020</xref>) that is expected to be a new type of botanical antibacterial agent. In this study, we further investigated the effects of the EO of 
 <italic>Z. armatum</italic> DC. on the control of 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> growth and evaluated the potential use of the EO as a botanical antifungal agent during the storage of platycladi semen.
