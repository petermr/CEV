<p>Aflatoxins are highly toxic secondary metabolites that are produced by several fungal species and that contaminate a wide variety of traditional Chinese medicines. Among them, aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), mainly produced by 
 <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus parasiticus</italic>, is the most significant form with respect to incidence and toxicity (

 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Afsharmanesh et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). AFB1 is 68 times more toxic than arsenic and second only to botulinum. Therefore, it is of great interest to reduce aflatoxin contamination in Chinese medicinal materials.
