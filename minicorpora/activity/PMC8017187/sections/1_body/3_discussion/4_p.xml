<p>The 2015 edition of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia stipulated that the storage conditions of platycladi semen must be cool and dry (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">National Pharmacopoeia Commission, 2015</xref>). However, through investigation in the early stage of this study, it was found that storage of platycladi semen more commonly occurred at room temperature. The results showed that the colony number of 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> was 366.67 cfu⋅g
 <sup>–1</sup> at room temperature and 144.44 cfu⋅g
 <sup>–1</sup> under cold storage, indicating that 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> was not active or grew slowly on platycladi semen under low temperature. Therefore, the refrigeration method is preferred for the storage of platycladi semen. Furthermore, the results showed that the number of colonies with EO fumigation at room temperature or cold storage was lower than that in other treatment groups, suggesting EO is a potential natural antifungal agent.
