<p>The aflatoxin content of platycladi semen treated with EO during storage was tested, and the results showed that the EO of 
 <italic>Z. armatum</italic> DC. could prolong the storage period of platycladi semen and ensure that aflatoxin did not exceed the standard within 100 days. Therefore, considering economic security and other factors and aflatoxin contamination in platycladi semen, the following prevention measures are proposed: when the aflatoxins in the initial storage of platycladi semen did not exceed the limit, the EO of 
 <italic>Z. armatum</italic> DC. could effectively inhibit 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic>, thus slowing down the production time of aflatoxin and extending the storage time. Therefore, for medicinal materials that are susceptible to aflatoxin, prevention and control of the growth of 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> and its toxin contamination are very important.
