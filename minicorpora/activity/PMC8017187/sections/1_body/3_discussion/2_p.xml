<p>In this study, we found that the EO of 
 <italic>Z. armatum</italic> DC. has high antifungal activity, which can destroy the growth of fungal hyphae, reduce the number of 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> colonies and the toxin content, and extend the storage period of platycladi semen. These findings suggest that EOs represent good candidates for controlling toxigenic fungi and subsequent mycotoxins.
