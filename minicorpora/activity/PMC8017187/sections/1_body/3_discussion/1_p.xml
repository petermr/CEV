<p>Contamination with fungi and subsequent mycotoxins is regarded as one of the worldâ€™s most severe problems (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2004</xref>) and has attracted notable attention. To eliminate this contamination, many methods are used to prevent fungal growth or inhibit the production of mycotoxins. At present, the use of plant EO to inhibit the growth of 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> and then inhibit aflatoxin contamination is a very effective method (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Mittal et al., 2019</xref>). EO has unique advantages in the prevention and control of 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Prakash et al., 2015</xref>). The first is safety. Most EOs come from plants with the same medicinal and edible origins, such as mint, cinnamon, and dried ginger. The second is volatility, which makes its application extremely simple. The EO only needs to be placed in a closed space. It is not only easy to contact 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> but also to maintain a high concentration of EO for a long time. In addition, a small dose of EO can be used for fumigation to achieve antifungal activity.
