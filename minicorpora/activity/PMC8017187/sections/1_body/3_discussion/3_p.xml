<p>Gas chromatography–mass spectrometer analysis revealed that the main components were β-caryophyllene (7.53%), 
 <sc>D</sc>-limonene (13.24%), linalool (41.73%), 4-terpenol (5.33%), and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-nerolidol (6.30%). The main components of the EO were slightly different from those reported in the literature (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Nooreen et al., 2019</xref>), such as linalool, isohexanal, and methyl-10-octadecanoate, which may be caused by the genetic differences of different plant populations, environmental and soil limitations, harvesting time, drying methods, and inconsistent extraction and analytical methods (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Prakash et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Nea et al., 2020</xref>). The biological activity of EO depends on the combined action of its main and minor components because even a small change in the content of EO may change its antifungal activity (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Li Y. et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, it is necessary to characterize the chemical properties of EO before determining its antifungal activity.
