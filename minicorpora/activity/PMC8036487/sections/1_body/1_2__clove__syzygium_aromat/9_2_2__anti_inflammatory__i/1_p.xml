<p>Clove essential oil, often used in aromatherapy to treat inflammatory diseases, including arthritis and rheumatism [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], was found to have anti-inflammatory effects in animal models at doses of 0.05 and 0.20 mL/kg [
 <xref rid="B83-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Interestingly, at this dosage, the anti-inflammatory effect of clove oil matches that of anti-inflammatory drugs like etodolac and indomethacin administered at 0.025 and 0.1, and 0.05 and 0.2 mL/kg doses, respectively [
 <xref rid="B83-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. The ethanol extracts of clove buds were also tested for anti-inflammatory effects at three doses (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg) in mice and Wistar rats using acetic acid-induced abdominal contractions in the former and formalin-induced hind paw edema in the latter animal models. The extract with an LD
 <sub>50</sub> (50% Lethal Dose) of 565.7 mg/kg produced significant effects at all three doses, supporting the use of the clove extract in inflammatory conditions [
