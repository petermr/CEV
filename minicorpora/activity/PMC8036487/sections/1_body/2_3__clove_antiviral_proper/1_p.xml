<p>The whole clove antiviral activity was tested by Tragoolpua and Jatisatienr [
 <xref rid="B101-molecules-26-01880" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>], who assayed an ethanol extract obtained from the plant flower buds for its anti-herpes simplex virus (HSV) properties. By a plaque reduction assay, the authors demonstrated that HSV was inhibited by the clove extract. Interestingly, the clove extract showed a direct inactivating action on the particles of the standard HSV strains. Moreover, the total HSV virus yield at 30 h declined after the treatment with the extract [
