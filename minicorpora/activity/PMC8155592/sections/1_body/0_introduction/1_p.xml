It is highly contagious and produces a disease known as COVID-19, which has pneumonia-like symptoms and has resulted in a pandemic. COVID-19 can infect all age groups, showing relatively severe symptoms in people over 60 years of age (

For a disease without treatment, preventive medicines are prescribed and immunomodulators with antivirals can serve the purpose. To control such infections, vaccination is considered to be an effective method; however, it is known to prevent the incidence of acute respiratory infections in healthy individuals only to a certain extent (

As seen in all viral infections including SARS-CoV-2, the virus-specific T cells responsible for cell-mediated immunity and B lymphocytes for humoral immunity, play important roles in the adaptive immune response by the body. There is an increase in neutrophils, interleukin (IL)-6 and C-reactive protein and a decrease in the total number of lymphocytes (
