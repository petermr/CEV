<p>Dietary polysaccharides are the prebiotics which are known to affect gut microbial ecology. There has been a direct correlation between nutrients present in the diet and the immune function (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). A number of micronutrients, macronutrients and the gut microbiome mediate the immunological effects of body. The microbial transformation of dietary components to its metabolites has a considerable effect on the physiological and immunological processes. There is a close relationship between the bacterial metabolism and the efficacy of phytochemicals as it may increase or decrease upon metabolism (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Following the advancements made in the field of microbial ecology, immunology and metabolomics, the impact of gut microbiota on host nutrition, immune modulation, resistance to pathogens, intestinal epithelial development and activity and energy metabolism has been recognized (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Plant-based nutritional foods are known to improve the population of beneficial bacteria present in intestines which help and constitute up to 85% of the immune system (

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) also showed the immunostimulation potential and it was observed that the COVID-19 cases were more prevalent in countries with lesser gram spice supply per capita per day (

Non-digestible nutrients that selectively promote the growth of normal intestinal bacterial flora are known to have beneficial effects on the large intestinal lining. After being hydrolyzed by gut bacteria, these nutrients may either bind to epithelia or get absorbed in the systemic circulation to stimulate the immune system (

Among studied immunomodulation factors (including recombinant interferon-gamma (rINF-γ), interferon-alpha (rINF-α), ampligen, and CL246), a total of 738 factors exhibited significant antiviral activity and were recommended for prophylactic or therapeutic use in early-stage infections of several species of viruses (
