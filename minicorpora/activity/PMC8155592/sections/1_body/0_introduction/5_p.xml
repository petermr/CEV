<p>The aim of this review was to summarize the most important medicinal plants which displayed good immunomodulation activity from the recently published literature. It also covers the possible mechanism of immunomodulation for these plants and the role of natural products in the treatment and management of viral infections. Recently published articles from commonly used search engines such as Pubmed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic Research, etc. which were related to the scope of the review were included. A good number of reviews are present discussing various plants and their bioactive constituents demonstrating immunomodulation and antiviral activities, however, an updated review focusing on the immunomodulation activities of important medicinal plants and their isolated molecules along with their mechanisms is still warranted.</p>
