Plant-based natural products such as curcumin have demonstrated promising immunomodulation activity and can be used as an adjunctive therapy for CM (

Dengue is another mosquito-borne viral disease causing high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine production, leading to endothelial activation and vascular leakage. Antioxidants and natural immunomodulating agents from plant sources have demonstrated promising results in the treatment of a number of viral infections (
