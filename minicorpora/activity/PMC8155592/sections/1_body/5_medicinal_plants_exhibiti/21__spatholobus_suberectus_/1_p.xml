 <italic>S. suberectus</italic> Dunn is a widely used traditional medicine for its therapeutic potential. Flavonoids, the major bioactive compounds of the plant reportedly reduced the PCV2-infected oxidative stress and exhibited immunosuppression. They were found to enhance the spleen and thymus indices such as SOD activity, GSH level, and GSH to GSSG ratio, as well as the downregulation of XOD and MPO activities. This finding indicated that the plant might act as a good antioxidant for treating diseases associated with oxidative stress including viral infections (
