 <italic>C. quinoa</italic> Willd. are considered to be excellent dietary sources of natural antioxidants promoting human health through immune-system modification (
 <xref rid="B174" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>). Purified polysaccharides from the plant have been further reported to exhibit immunomodulation activity by increasing macrophage proliferation and suppression of NO production on inflammatory RAW264.7, in addition to antioxidant and anticancer properties (
