 <italic>G. lucidum</italic> is a white root fungus also known as Reishi mushroom or Red Lingzhi and has been used mainly in China for a long time to promote good health. The antiaging effect of its extract is primarily due to its antioxidant and immunomodulation properties. It is also reported to have anti-breast cancer and anti-neurodegeneration properties (

 <italic>G. lucidum</italic> are approved by the Chinese FDA for the treatment of a large number of health-related problems including physical weakness, chronic hepatitis, chronic bronchitis, coronary heart disease, and anemia. The polysaccharide preparation is used for its antitumor, antioxidant, immunomodulation, and hypoglycemic activities (
