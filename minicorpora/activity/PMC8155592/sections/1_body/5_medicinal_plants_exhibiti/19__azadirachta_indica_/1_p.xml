The chemical constituents are mainly of two types: isoprenoids (azadiractins, salanin, vilasinin, and nimbin) and non-isoprenoids (polyphenolics, flavonoids, coumarins, and sulfurous compounds). The compound hyperoside isolated from leaves showed excellent interactions with conserved residues of nucleoprotein and could be a future drug for influenza virus (
