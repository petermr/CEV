<p>The immunomodulating properties of medicinal plants have been studied much extensively during recent years due to the growing awareness on immune system modulation strategy to combat infectious diseases specifically the viral infections. A number of plants are already in use in folklore medicine for the treatment and prevention of viral infections either by directly affecting the pathogen or by stimulating the defense mechanism of human body in many ways. It is believed that the terpenoids present in these medicinal plants have promising efficacies in inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 replications. Also, the alkaloidal structures such as lycorine, homoharringtonine and emetine have anti-coronaviral activities. Other isolated natural products such as emodin, baicalin, lguesterin, cryptotanshinone, silvestrol and sotetsuflavone showed inhibition of important viral replication enzymes inhibiting their growth (
