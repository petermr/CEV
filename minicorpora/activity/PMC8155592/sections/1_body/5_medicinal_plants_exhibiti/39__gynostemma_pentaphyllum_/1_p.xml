 <italic>G. pentaphyllum</italic> showed that its polysaccharides effectively increased the spleen and thymus indices, activated macrophage phagocytosis and NK cells, and exhibited activity on Con A/LPS-stimulated splenocytes in a dose-dependent manner. It also increased the IL-2 levels in sera and spleen, as well as the SOD, GSH-Px, T-AOC, GSH, and CAT levels; conversely, MDA levels were decreased (
