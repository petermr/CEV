 <italic>R. gastrodiae</italic> have been used to treat convulsions, hemiplegia, neurasthenia, headache, ischemia, and dementia.

The antidepressant effect of the drug is probably exhibited by the modulation and regulation of its monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity and monoamine concentration. Furthermore, its antioxidant activity, GABAergic system induction, neuroprotection and anti-inflammatory properties have also been reported (
