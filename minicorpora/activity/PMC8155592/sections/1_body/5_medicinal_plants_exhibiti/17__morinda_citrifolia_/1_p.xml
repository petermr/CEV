 <italic>M. citrifolia</italic> L. reportedly showed immunomodulation and cytotoxic effects due to the presence of nordamnacanthal, which is an anthraquinone derived from fruits and stem of the plant. Moreover, an increase in the production of T helper, cytotoxic T1, and NK cells with a decrease in the size of tumors have been observed through

The fermented fruit extract was shown to restore skin-barrier-related proteins including filaggrin, loricrin, involucrin, zonula occludens-1, and occludin, and minimize 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB)-induced atopic dermatitis-like lesions through the modulation of skin barrier function and immune balance (
