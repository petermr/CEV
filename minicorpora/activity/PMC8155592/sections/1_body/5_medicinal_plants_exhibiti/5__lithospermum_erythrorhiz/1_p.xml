 <italic>L. erythrorhizon</italic> (Gromwell), a Chinese traditional medicine used from ancient times to treat smallpox, measles, macular eruptions, eczema, burns, and carbucles, is extremely popular in China and Taiwan. This herb is well known for the treatment of abnormal skin conditions such as wounds, inflammation, and burns. Dextrose capsule with 1.5 g of root extract improved stratum corneum hydration in parallel with increased ceramides in the outermost layer of epidermis (

Shikonin is reported to express approximately 50 genes, including chemokines (CCL4 and CCL8), cytokines (IL-1b, IL-4 and TNF-α), and inflammatory modulators (PTGS2 and NFATC3) and reduced the surface expression of a primary HIV-1 co-receptor, CCR5, which may lead to the development of potential anti-HIV agents (
