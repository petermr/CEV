 <italic>A. blazei</italic> Murrill. is an edible mushroom possessing significant medicinal values owing to a number of chemical and nutritional constituents, such as polysaccharides, glycoproteins, phytosterols, Î²-D-glucan, and saponins. The polysaccharide components of the fungus are thought to be the main active component responsible for its antihyperlipidemic, immunomodulator, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities (

 <italic>A. blazei</italic> exhibited opposite effects on NK cells. Water extract increased the cytotoxic activity of NK cells by stimulating the expression of cytotoxic proteins NKG2D cell surface receptors and ethanol extract reduced the expression of cytolytic and cell surface receptors (
