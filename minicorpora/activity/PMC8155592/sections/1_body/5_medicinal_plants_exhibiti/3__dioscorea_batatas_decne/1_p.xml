 <italic>D. batatas</italic> Decne is extensively used in traditional and modern medicines and the tuber of the plant contains a number of active components, including dioscorin, diosgenin, mucopolysaccharides, batatasins, and glycoproteins, exhibiting immunomodulation activities upon oral administration. Tuber protein and dioscorin displayed mucosal and systemic immunomodulation activity through TLR4-induced macrophage activation by stimulating signaling molecules such as NF-kB, JNK, p38, and ERK, as well as by expressing cytokines such as TNF-Î± and IL-6 (
