 <italic>C. sinensis</italic>, popularly known as green tea, has been extensively used worldwide as a traditional medicine since ancient times owing to its antioxidant property. Catechins including epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), epigallocatechin (EGC) epicatechin (EC), and EC gallate (ECG) are the major bioactive molecules isolated from tea leaves and are responsible for its antioxidant, antiviral, anticancer, and antifungal activities. EGC and EGCG are reported to exhibit immunomodulation activity through the generation of cytokines and T lymphocyte proliferation. The extract also reportedly enhanced the production of lymphocyte, monocytes, IL-1α, and IL-1β (
