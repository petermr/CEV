<p>The methanol extract of roots of 
 <italic>Phyllanthus amarus</italic> Schum. &amp; Thonn. exhibited potent anticancer activity in MCF-7 cells through apoptosis induction mediated by improved intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in conjugation with decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. Antioxidant, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, antiviral, anti-venom, and anti-inflammatory activities of the plant preparations have also been reported (
