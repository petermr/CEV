 <italic>E. officinalis</italic> (Amla) was shown to restore the Cr-induced immunosuppression by re-establishing the proliferation of lymphocytes and the production of IL-2 and INF-Î± (
 <xref rid="B141" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>). Furthermore, the fruit extract restored the antioxidant status to normal by inhibiting the Cr-induced production of free radicals and reversing Cr-induced DNA fragmentation and apoptosis in an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> experiment (
 <xref rid="B218" ref-type="bibr">218</xref>). Amla is extremely rich in vitamin C (even more than orange or lemon) and has been traditionally used as a tonic to recover vigor and lost energy. It also contains other bioactive constituents such as alkaloids, phenolic compounds, and tannins and exhibit a wide range of therapeutic actions, including antidiabetic, antioxidant, and anticancer. Amla stimulated the NK cell activity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, enhancing 35% life span of tumor-bearing mice (
