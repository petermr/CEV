 <italic>H. polybotrys</italic> extract contain formononetin and proanthocyanidin as chemical constituents which showed remarkable immune stimulation activity. The proliferation of splenocytes and LPS-activated RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated and NO radical scavengering was increased, whereas NO-induced cytotoxicity was decreased. Conversely, the extract also inhibited PGE2, COX-2, iNOS, NO, LPS-activated 264.7 cells, and splenocytes (
