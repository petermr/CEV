<p>Activation of family of TLRs including TLR-3, 7, 8 and 9 mediates the production of type-I interferons (IFN-Is) and pro-inflammatory cytokines. The cytokines are responsible for the production of a number of inflammatory mediators causing inflammation, fever and pain; whereas, the IFN-Is are the important mediators of antiviral immunity and are responsible for the antiviral activities (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Similarly, RLRs sense and detect the viral RNA in the cytosol resulting into the induction of IFN-Is. The RLRs can generally differentiate between the viral RNA and the host RNA owing to the distinct features present in the viral RNA (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). The RLRs can detect the double-stranded viral RNA and activate NF-ÎºB and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) through the adaptive protein, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), a protein that resides in the mitochondrial membrane and orchestrates host antiviral innate immune responses to the RNA-virus infection (
