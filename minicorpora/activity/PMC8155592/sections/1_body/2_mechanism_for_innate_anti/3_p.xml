<p>The activation of PRRs initiates signal transduction 
 <italic>via</italic> a series of adaptor proteins leading to the expression of a number of transcription factors such as NF-ÎºB, IRF-3, IRF-7 and several kinases; consequently the production of antiviral IFN-Is. However, certain viruses have evolved in such a way that they can block the innate immune-signaling and hinder the antiviral responses by host. They escape detection by PRRs, can block the activation of adaptor proteins and kinases and can disrupt the transcription factors; thereby successfully invade the host cells (
