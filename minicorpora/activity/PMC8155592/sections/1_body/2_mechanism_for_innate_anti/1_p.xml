<p>Innate immunity are the non-specific immunity which includes expression of factors resulting into inhibition of virus particles and slowing down the infections in a rapid manner without adaptation or generation of long-lasting memory for protection. The innate antiviral responses are critical in order to mobilize the protective immunity. Upon viral infection, the innate immunity cells get activated mainly through the germline-coded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) which are present either on the cellular surfaces or within distinct intracellular compartments. The PRRs include the family of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), the retinoic acid-inducible gene-I-like receptors (RLRs), cytosolic DNA sensors and the nucleotide-oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLRs) (

These PRRs present in a wide array of cellular components sense the presence of viral antigen and quickly respond to the viral infection and replication of these viruses in the cellular compartments.
