<p>The treatment of infectious diseases involves either directly killing the infecting microbes or therapeutically modulating the body’s immune responses to eradicate pathogenic organisms from the body without causing injury to the host cells. The immunity to microbial attacks might involve nonspecific responses (innate immunity) to common antigens or acquired responses (adaptive immunity) to specific microbes (

 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Multiple potential targets have been identified to modulate the immune responses of body for the microbial attacks. Considering that viruses are obligate intracellular pathogens and entirely dependent on the host, direct therapy using pharmaceuticals for viral infection is difficult (
