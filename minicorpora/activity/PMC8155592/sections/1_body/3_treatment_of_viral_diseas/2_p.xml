<p>Natural products are known to primarily stimulate the nonspecific immune responses (innate immunity), in which the mediators of immune system including cytokines, macrophages, neutrophils, acute-phase proteins and monocytes provide instant defense against pathogens (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Pathogens express different factors known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which are recognized by the host to perceive the presence of pathogens. PAMPs are recognized by host sensors using PRRs triggering a sequence of immune reactions through the generation of type-1 IFNs, cytokines, and chemokines. PRR families include NOD-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors and DNA receptors (

TLR-3, -7,- 8, and -9 are extremely important in sensing viral infections as they transduce signals to the system, which then activates antiviral processes. Agents that nonspecifically stimulate TLR-mediated responses may be potential antiviral remedies (

In nonspecific immunity, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and macrophages play important roles in cytokine secretion, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and antigen presentation, processing and phagocytosis. The stimulation of naïve B cells and naïve T cells occurs through dendritic cells. Natural killer cells are upregulated, leading to the production of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and INF-γ (
