<p>Nevertheless, these medicinal plants have to undergo standardization assessing both quality of the product and the methodology of research. Another scope of future research on medicinal plants is the chemical modification of active ingredients directed to enhance its efficacy and pharmacokinetic properties. For example, curcumin is not effective alone clinically owing to its absorption and metabolism issue, but chemically modified curcumin (demethoxycurcumin and bis-demoethoxycurcumin) have shown better druggability properties and are under clinical trials. Many of the active constituents of these medicinal plants face the pharmacokinetics related problems and suffer from poor absorption and rapid metabolism leading to poor bioavailability. Several alternate strategies are being adopted and researches are being focused on the development of nanotechnology-based formulations, changing the way of administration and changing the drug delivery technique.</p>
