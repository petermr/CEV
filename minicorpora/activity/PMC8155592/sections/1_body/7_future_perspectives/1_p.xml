<p>Dysfunction of immune system has been evidently implicated with the development of a number of diseases and modulating and maintaining an efficient immune system has proven to be a justified approach in the treatment of associated diseases. However, there are certain limitations to this approach owing to the complexity of immune system as well as the unavailability of expedient analytical tools to measure the immune functions. Future research on NK cells, cytokine receptors and markers and blood-borne particles are warranted. Despite these limitations, certain medicinal plants have been tested to offer novel avenues for the immune system modulation either alone or in combination and the results are very encouraging. In comparison to other immunity-targeted therapies such as the administration of monoclonal antibodies, plants and their derived products have shown important advantages including abundance and lesser adverse effects.</p>
