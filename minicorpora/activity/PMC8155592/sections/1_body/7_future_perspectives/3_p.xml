<p>Another promising approach is to test the combination of active constituents obtained from these medicinal plants which could achieve targeted therapy and have synergistic effects with reduced toxicities. Multitarget drugs can also be designed by linking the bioactive molecules by means of suitable spacers and fusion or amalgamation of the pharmacophoric elements which are essential for the activity to get the hybridized molecule. The mechanisms by which these medicinal plants and their bioactive molecules demonstrate immunomodulation are complex and involve multiple signal transduction pathways. Most of these products show extensive and multiple pharmacological effects and their targets and molecular mechanisms are not fully elucidated and understood. Most of the reported biological activities of these medicinal plants are based on cell based 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and animal based 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies, but high level clinical studies are still required to establish their efficacies and toxicities in humans. It is therefore expected that with the advancements in the future molecular level studies, these medicinal plants and their derived products would demonstrate promising breakthroughs and constitute one of the important approaches for immunotherapy.
