<p>Respiratory diseases caused by viral infections including influenza and common cold are globally widespread apart from the repetitive viral outbreaks from SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Direct treatment of such viral infections by modern medicines are not very efficient, and although vaccination is considered to be effective in preventing viral infections, the incidence of acute respiratory infections could be reduced only to some extent. Consequently, alternative treatments for viral infections are necessary, and in this regard, the stimulation of the body’s immune defense system could be an efficient method of preventing these infections. A wide range of plant extracts, herbal products, and pure plant constituents have shown potential immunomodulation effects and used either as prophylactic or therapeutic agents for infectious diseases. Apart from infectious diseases, plant-based immunomodulators can help treat several other immunologic and inflammatory illnesses including cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, plaque psoriasis, Crohn’s disease, etc. These plant products and their bioactive molecules modulate immune responses through the stimulation and modification of lymphocytes, macrophages, and cytokine production. Many plant extracts contain a number of active principles, including polysaccharides, terpenoids, alkaloids, flavonoids, glycosides, and essential oils, which have tremendous capability to maintain and/or stimulate the immune system primarily through the modulation of nonspecific immune responses. However, these plant extracts may contain one or more of the active constituents and their relative contribution and mechanism in the generation of immunomodulation activity are difficult to understand. Isolated pure plant constituents may prove to be specific and effective immunomodulators capable of counteracting the high cost and adverse effects of modern medication. Nevertheless, the drawbacks associated with the application of plant products include the development of standard testing and quality control protocols need to be properly addressed. The present review highlights the importance of medicinal plants containing immunomodulating components of different chemistries with possible utilization in controlling the viral infections. This might stimulate the efforts of researchers towards developing alternative plant-based treatments for infectious diseases.</p>
