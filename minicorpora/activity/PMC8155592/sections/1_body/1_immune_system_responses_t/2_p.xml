<p>Owing to the high sequence variability of viruses, they can avoid immune responses

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Viruses can interfere with the antiviral signaling of the immune system by altering genetic materials, reducing cytokine generation (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), and hindering the expression of PRRs and their adapter (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Viruses can also affect the immune response by reducing the cytotoxic function of T cells (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) and reducing NKG2D and MHC-1 molecules, thereby suppressing immune stimulation (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). For example, dengue and West Nile viruses escape immune response through the blockage of IFN-α/IFN-β receptors (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), and influenza viruses achieve gene mutations involved in antigen binding through “antigen drift” (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). In another way of escaping immune responses, virus particles enter a host cell in the dormant state and subsequently are reactivated when the cell immunity weakens. Consequently, the detection of viruses becomes difficult because the infected cells start upregulating the expression of latency-related genes rather than lytic viral genes (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).
