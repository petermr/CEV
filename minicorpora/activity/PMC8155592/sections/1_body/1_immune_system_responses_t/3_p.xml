<p>These viruses can be best exemplified by human papillomavirus (HPV), which can adopt a dormant state and after assuming dormancy, the migrating HIV-infected cells can be reactivated by differential responses to drugs (

 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). These viruses can create a favorable environment for infection through alteration of various metabolic processes of host cells; such as enhanced fatty acid synthesis, change in aerobic glycolysis, and glutaminolysis (

 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Additionally, enhanced lactic acid production creates an acidic microenvironment that helps in virus pathogenesis as the fusion of an enveloped virus to the host cell membrane occurs more effectively at acidic pH (
