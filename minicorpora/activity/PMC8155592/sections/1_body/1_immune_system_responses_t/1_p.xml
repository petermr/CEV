<p>Infection by pathogenic viruses causes a number of infectious diseases, such as influenza, smallpox, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS, measles, and newly identified COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The body’s defense system recognizes the infecting organisms such as viruses and bacteria as foreign particles through innate or adaptive immunity systems. In case of innate immunity, foreign microbes are identified by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) situated on the surface of innate immune cells. Subsequently, the invading organisms are destroyed by certain defense processes, such as cytotoxin generation by natural killer (NK) cells and macrophage-mediated phagocytosis (

In adaptive immunity, microorganisms are recognized by T and B lymphocytes through cell surface-antigen-specific receptors (T cell and B cell receptors) and the invaders are eliminated through cytotoxic responses (e.g., neutrophils, CD45+ lymphocytes, CD8+ T cell, monocytes, and mature B lymphocytes) and antibody production (

However, pathogenic microbes often succeed in infecting the biological system despite the strong defense mechanisms even in immunocompetent individuals because of a number of immune-evasion tactics, including surpassing recognition by immune cells and immobilizing immune responses (
