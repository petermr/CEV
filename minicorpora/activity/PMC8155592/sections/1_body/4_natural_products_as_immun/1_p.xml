<p>Normally, the body’s defense system maintains homeostasis; however, several endogenous or exogenous factors can alter its efficiency and effectiveness. Molecules from synthetic, natural, or biological origins can modify (suppress or stimulate) either the innate or adaptive component of immunity and are known as immunomodulators (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). Immunomodulators which improve the immune responses against infections either by activating or inducing the immune-system components are regarded as immunostimulants (

Some synthetic compounds and monoclonal antibodies are available as immunomodulators, but their use has been associated with a number of limitations, including side effects. For example, the use of recombinant cytokines as immunostimulants is associated with hypotension, myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy and GI distress (

Thus, safe and effective agents are still required; indeed a significant amount of research has been conducted to identify natural products as immunomodulators. Immunomodulators from wide varieties of plants, their extracts, active plant ingredients and plant products have been investigated (

Recently, plants containing polyphenolic compounds such as flavonoids in the form of fruit juice, extract, or isolated active constituents have been extensively studied for several beneficial effects, including their capability to modify the body’s defense system. Flavonoids are primarily antioxidant and exhibit inhibitory properties on inflammatory cytokine generation (
