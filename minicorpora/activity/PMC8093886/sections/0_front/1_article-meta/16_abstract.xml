 <p>In this study, the anxiolytic activity of 
  <italic>Piper nigrum</italic> essential oil (PNEO) was evaluated in the elevated plus maze (EPM) and the antidepressant-like effect was evaluated through tail suspension test (TST) in mice. Flumazenil, a competitive inhibitor of GABA
  <sub>A</sub> receptor in the benzodiazepine site and WAY-100635 maleate salt, a 5-HT
  <sub>1A</sub> receptor antagonist were used to find out the possible mechanism(s) of action of PNEO. To exclude the false-positive results due to the enhancement of the locomotor activity, the animals were submitted to open field test (OFT). We also measured monoamines levels of the mice brain after acute PNEO treatment. The data obtained from the study suggest that the anxiolytics and antidepressant-like effect of PNEO have observed in EPM and TST respectively in a dose-dependent manner after oral acute and repetitive treatment. WAY-100635, but not flumazenil was able to reverse the effect of PNEO in EPM and TST both, indicating the possible involvement of 5-HT
  <sub>1A</sub> receptor. The neurochemical analysis showed no alteration in monoamine levels in mice brains. Furthermore, no locomotor impairment or sign of toxicity or changes in body weight or abnormalities in the biochemical parameters, except for a significant decrease in total cholesterol level was observed after treatment with PNEO. The findings suggest that 
  <italic>Piper nigrum</italic> EO possesses a dual anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effect through the possible involvement of serotonergic transmission.
