<p id="p0105">To investigate the anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effect of PNEO showed in the EPM and TST respectively, is due to the involvement of GABA-ergic or serotonergic system, before receiving the single dose of PNEO10 (The dose was selected according to the findings of the series of the animal activity) were pre-treated with flumazenil or WAY-100635. As represented in 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>(A and B), pre-treatment with FLU could not block the effects of PNEO in EPM. However, pre-treatment with WAY significantly reversed the anxiolytic effect of PNEO. In the same way, pre-treatment with WAY but not FLU significantly reversed the effects of PNEO on the immobility time in the TST (
