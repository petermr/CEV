<p id="p0085">The active constituents present in the essential oil of 
 <italic>Piper nigrum</italic> were identified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and thirty-three compounds were identified, accounting for 98.33% of the total composition (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Monoterpene hydrocarbons dominated the PNEO composition, accounting for 73.40% of the total. The most abundant components were limonene (25.34%), sabinene (22.86 %), and β-pinene (10.43%). Other minor components of this group were α-pinene (7.84%), thujene (2.76%) and α-phellandrene (1.12%). Sesquiterpenes hydrocarbons (23.51%) made a small contribution to the PNEO, with caryophyllene (13.38%), bisabolene (3.98%) and α-copaene (2.83%) as the most representative compounds.
