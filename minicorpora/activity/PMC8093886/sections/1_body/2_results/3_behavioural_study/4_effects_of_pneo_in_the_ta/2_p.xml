<p id="p0100">The results of the TST after the acute and repeated administration of the PNEO are represented in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>. By comparing the vehicle group to the PNEO 10 and PNEO 50 group, there was a significant reduction in immobility time after acute administration. Whereas, a single dose of PNEO 5 and diazepam did not modify the immobility time in TST (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, left panel). The long term administration of PNEO at all doses and buspirone resulted in a significant reduction in the immobility time (
