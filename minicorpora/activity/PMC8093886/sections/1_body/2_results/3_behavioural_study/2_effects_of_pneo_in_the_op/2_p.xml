<p id="p0090">The OFT was carried out to access the exploratory behavior of the PNEO in mice. As represented in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>(A), acute and repeated treatment of PNEO, diazepam and buspirone treatments had no effect on the number of crossings (overall locomotor activity)., but the number of rearing behavior significantly reduced by acute (10, 50 mg/kg) and repetitive treatment (5, 10, 50 mg/kg) of PNEO. Moreover, grooming behavior is also reduced significantly by acute and repetitive treatment of PNEO at all doses. Similarly, diazepam (single dose) and buspirone (repetitive dose) administration, significantly decreased the number of rearing and grooming behaviours as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2 (B and C)</xref>.
