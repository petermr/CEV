<p id="p0070">The mice were treated with an acute dose of PNEO of 5, 10 or 50 mg/kg before being sacrificed right after the tail suspension test., The brain tissue was weighed and homogenized manually with ice-cold 0.1 M perchloric acid, centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 m and stored at -80 °C until the determination of monoamines level. The level of monoamines (dopamine and serotonin) and their metabolites (3, 4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, homovanillic acid and 5-hydroxy indole acetic acid) were measured by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a system (Water 515, Milford, Massachusetts, U.S.A) With an electrochemical detector. 20 μl supernatant homogenate was loaded into a sample injector and the mobile phase (50 mM Sodium citrate at pH 3.5, 0.3 mM sodium edetate, 1.8 mM dibutylamine and 4% methanol) was delivered at a constant rate of 0.35 ml/m. Every sample had a 15-minute runtime, and all monoamines and their metabolites were measured in nanograms per gram (ng/g) of fresh tissue weight (
