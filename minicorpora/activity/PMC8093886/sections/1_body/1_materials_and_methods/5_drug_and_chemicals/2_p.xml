<p id="p0040">Diazepam (DZP, Svizzera Healthcare, India) and Buspirone HCl (BSP, Sigma-Aldrich, U.S.A) was used as reference drugs. Flumazenil (FLU, Sigma-Aldrich, U.S.A), a competitive inhibitor of GABA
 <sub>A</sub> receptor in the benzodiazepine site and WAY-100635 maleate salt (WAY, Sigma-Aldrich, U.S.A) a 5-HT
 <sub>1A</sub> receptor antagonist was used to find out the possible mechanism(s) of action. PNEO was dissolved in 0.01% (v/v) Tween 80 (Central Drug House, India) in saline and treated orally (p.o.). For the intraperitoneal treatments, the reference drugs and other agents were given by dissolving in normal saline (0.9 %w/v NaCl). All samples were freshly prepared before the behavioral testing and treated at 0.1 ml/10 g of body weight (b/w), except Flumazenil, which was treated at 0.2 ml/10 g of b/w.
