<p id="p0030">Chemical constituents present in PNEO were analyzed by Gas chromatography combined with mass-spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan). The temperature of the fused silica capillary column was set to 70 °C for an initial hold period of 2m, then to 250 °C for a final hold period of 3m, splitless injection mode was used. Helium was taken as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 10.4 ml/m and MS detector was used in complete scan mode with EI ionization at 70eV. The components present in PNEO were identified by integrating a computer library search based on the similarity of fragmentation patterns of mass spectrum with those documented in NIST library, as well as visual interpretation of mass spectra and retention indices calculated using the n-alkane homologous series as a reference.</p>
