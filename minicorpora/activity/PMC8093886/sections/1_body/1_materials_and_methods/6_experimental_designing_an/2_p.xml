<p id="p0045">Since there was no widely accepted dosage of 
 <italic>P.nigrum</italic> EO for neuropharmacological activity, the lowest dose of 5 mg/kg of b/w was chosen, as it had previously shown to have a significant anxiolytic and antidepressant-like efffect in a pilot study. All experiments were performed using a total number of 228 mice. To evaluate the anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effect of the acute treatment of PNEO, the mice (n = 6 per group) were randomly divided into five study groups: vehicle (CON), DZP (1 mg/kg), PNEO (5 mg/kg), PNEO (10 mg/kg), PNEO (50 mg/kg) and for the treatment with repeated dose, mice were treated with vehicle control, PNEO and reference drug once in a day for 21 days(

In this case, mice (n = 6 per group) were also randomly divided into five study groups as follows vehicle (CON), BSP (10 mg/kg), PNEO (5 mg/kg), PNEO (10 mg/kg), PNEO (50 mg/kg). Despite the consistent effect of diazepam after acute treatment, we have selected buspirone (a 5-HT
 <sub>1A</sub> receptor antagonist with a slow onset of action and inconclusive acute effect) as a reference drug in repetitive treatment due to the cognition impairment was associated with long term use of diazepam in mice (

 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Salomons et al., 2012</xref>). To evaluate the possible mechanism(s) of action behind the anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effect of the acute treatment of PNEO, FLU (a competitive inhibitor of GABA
 <sub>A</sub> receptor in the benzodiazepine site) and WAY (a 5-HT
 <sub>1A</sub> receptor antagonist) were pre-treated. For this purpose, mice (n = 6 per group) were also randomly divided into six study groups: vehicle (CON), PNEO (10 mg/kg), FLU (3 mg/kg), FLU (3 mg/kg) + PNEO (10 mg/kg), WAY (1 mg/kg), WAY (1 mg/kg) + PNEO (10 mg/kg).
