<p id="p0075">Mice were given a regular dosage of 5, 10, or 50 mg/kg PNEO in EPM and FST for 21 days and were observed daily for common signs of toxicity like irritability, reaction to contact, gripping the tail, twisting, writhing, grip strength, ataxia, tremor, convulsion, lacrimation, piloerection and respiratory frequency. The mice were periodically weighed on days 1, 7, 14 and 21 to evaluate changes in body weight. After the accomplishing of the general behavioral toxicity study, blood was collected for biochemical evaluation. Biochemical analysis was performed by centrifuging the collected blood (without anticoagulant) at 4 °C in 3000 rpm for 10 m and the separated serum was stored at -20 °C until further use. Biochemical parameters like aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, glucose, creatinine and urea were analyzed by different test kits (ARKRAY Healthcare Pvt.
