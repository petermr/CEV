 <italic>Piper nigrum</italic> EO possesses a significant anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effect through the possible involvement of serotonergic transmission. Also, no signs of toxicity were produced by EO at different doses and thus appeared to be well tolerated. Our findings highlight that lipophilic volatile compounds from natural products can be a good source for discovering new medicinal agents having a fast onset of action and less adverse effects for the treatment of comorbid anxiety and depression. However further studies are required to compare the whole EO of 
 <italic>P.Â nigrum</italic> and its major constituents for the neuropharmacological effects and their possible mechanisms of action and discover meaningful synergisms between them.
