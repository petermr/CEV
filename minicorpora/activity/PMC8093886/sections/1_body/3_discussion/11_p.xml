<p id="p0165">Finally, essential oils are compound mixtures of diverse molecules. The major compounds of the EO from 
 <italic>Piper nigrum</italic> were identified as limonene. According to a previous report, limonene was unable to alter the parameters of anxiolytic-like activity evaluated in the EPM test (
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">do Vale et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, a previous study reported that a major identified compound, limonene from 
 <italic>Citrus aurantium</italic> was not able to modify the immobility time (
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Costa et al., 2013</xref>). These shreds of evidence indicate that anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects of PNEO cannot be attributed to the major compound, limonene only but also the combined synergistic effects of components present in it. According to the theory of a multi-targeted approach as a therapeutic strategy, only one constituent from the herbal preparation cannot be always responsible for every bioactivity (
