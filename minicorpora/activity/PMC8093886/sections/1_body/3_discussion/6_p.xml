<p id="p0140">For the evaluation of the anxiolytic effect of PNEO, the elevated plus-maze test has been used which is based on the natural fear of rats and mice of height and wide-open spaces. In this model, the experimental animals avoided the open arms of the maze due to their natural fear of elevated zones (
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Lister, 1987</xref>). Also, the choice of this model as an anxiety test is due to its etiological validity. The number of entries and the permanence time in the open arms were taken as a marker to conclude the anxiolytic effect of the essential oil (

Our results show that there is an increase in the number of open arm entries and time of permanence in the open arm after the acute and repetitive administration of PNEO which is quite similar as in the case of diazepam and buspirone induced group. Several other EOs, like
