<p id="p0155">Subsequently, we decided to investigate the possible underlying mechanism of PNEO. In the EPM, pre-treatment with WAY 100635, although not flumazenil, significantly reversed the anxiolytic-like activity (number of entries and permanence time in the open arm) of PNEO. The immobility time of the PNEO treated group in TST was also significantly reduced after pre-treatment with WAY 100635. These findings might indicate that the anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects of PNEO are likely mediated by the serotonergic transmission system. Similar findings have been reported from 
 <italic>P. roseum</italic> EO, which exhibited their anxiolytic and antidepressant effects via 5-HT receptor (

In anxiety disorders, the central dopaminergic system is considered one of the most important factors and a previous report suggested that most neuropharmacological effects through dopamine transmission directly controlled by serotonin transmission system (
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Scalzitti et al., 1999</xref>). Furthermore, studies on limonene showed that it inhibits methamphetamine-induced locomotor activity possibly through regulation of 5-HT and dopamine neurotransmission (
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Yun, 2014</xref>). Therefore, we further decided to perform the neurochemical analysis and the neurochemical assessment revealed no alterations in the levels of DA, 5HT and their metabolites in the brain after acute treatments with the PNEO. It has been indicated that dopamine transmission could not involve in the effect of PNEO, but still long-term treatment will be required to reveal its effect on neurotransmission systems.
