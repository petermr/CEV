<p id="p0135">Some classes of drugs like psychoactive stimulants give false-positive results due to the enhancement of the locomotor activity (

The findings revealed that acute and repeated PNEO administration has anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects in mice without affecting locomotor function. The results show quite a good congruence with those described by Chioca, who suggested that linalool and linalyl acetate which are the main constituents of lavender EO exhibits anxiolytic effects in mice without modifying spontaneous locomotor activity (
