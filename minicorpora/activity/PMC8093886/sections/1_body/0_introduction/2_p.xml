The first-line treatment of these disorders commonly employs barbiturates, benzodiazepines and azapirone but imposes some serious adverse effects including motor dysfunction, deficits in attention, sedation, convulsion and sexual disability (

According to WHO near about 4.4 % of the global population are living with depression. Depression will soon become a major cause of disability and morbidity after cardiac diseases.
