<p>The low beta wave power was slightly increased in the frontal region. The alpha and beta wave powers were decreased in the centro-temporal regions. The slow alpha, low beta, mid beta, and high beta wave powers were decreased. Only the mid beta wave power was decreased in the parieto-occipital region (

During the 1:10,000 oil inhalation, the alpha wave power was decreased in both the slow and fast alpha components in the frontal region. The same result was observed in the centro-parietal region. The mid beta wave power was only decreased at parieto-occipital region (
