<p>Centro-temporal region alteration was observed in the same fashion as in the frontal region. Slight changes of beta wave power were observed in the occipital region compared with the frontal and centro-temporal region for 1:1000 dilution (

Beta wave and alpha wave powers were clearly decreased in the frontal, centro-temporal, and parieto-occipital regions for the 1:400 oil dilution. The slow alpha, low beta, and mid beta wave powers were decreased in the frontal and parieto-occipital regions. The slow alpha, fast alpha, theta, low beta, mid beta, and high beta wave powers were decreased in the centro-temporal region during oil inhalation (
