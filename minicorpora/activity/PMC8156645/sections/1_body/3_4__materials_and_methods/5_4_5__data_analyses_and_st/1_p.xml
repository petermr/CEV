<p>The EEG data are shown as the median with a 95% CI. The mood scores are reported as the mean ± the standard error of the mean. Analyses of variance were performed followed by the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test for non-parametric data. Statistical differences were considered at p-values less than 0.05. EEG brainwave powers were processed by power spectral analysis and frequency domain data of subbands, including slow alpha (8–11 Hz), fast alpha (11–13 Hz), low beta (13–15 Hz), mid beta (15–20 Hz), and high beta (20–30 Hz). Mood scores were tested using an unpaired t test. All the statistics and graph preparations were produced using GraphPad Prism 9 (San Diego, California, United States).</p>
