Lethargy and stress were the negative moods. The meanings of these English words were translated into Thai language. The explanation was instructed to the volunteers preventing meaning confusion. The visual analog scales for self-assessment of the mood state of the subjects were evaluated after the inhalation of essential oil. The internal mood was scored by the individual subject by marking on a 10 cm horizontal line. Three oils were tested for a volunteer. To minimize carryover effect, the oils were given in this concentration order from the lowest concentration to the highest concentration.
