    "The widespread prevalence and mortality of coronavirus diseases-2019 (COVID-19) lead many researchers to study the SARS-CoV-s2 infection to find a treatment for this disease. Discovering the mechanisms of action of COVID-19 and coping at the cellular level with this disease can have better effects. Including the target tissues of this disease are the lungs and the immune system. It is stated that COVID-19 easily infiltrates into alveoli through its receptors and then starts to proliferate. Subsequently, with the weakening of immune cells and increase inflammatory cytokines, it increases the rate of inflammation in the body. Strengthening the immune system and inhibiting COVID-19 receptors can play a preventive or even therapeutic role for this disease. <i>Nigella sativa</i> (<i>N. sativa</i>) is one of the herbal medicines to possess numerous pharmacological effects related to several organs of the body. Among the extraordinary properties of this plant is improving asthma and several lung diseases. The recent studies have shown that <i>N. sativa</i> at the cellular level can inhibit COVID-19 receptors. It was also stated that performing regular exercise training (especially moderate-intensity exercise training) can modulate the immune system and have an anti-inflammatory effect. Since the use of herbal supplements with exercise can have tremendous therapeutic effects at the cellular level, the hypothesis to use the <i>Nigella sativa</i> along with exercise training to prophylaxis and treatment COVID-19 will be highlighted in this paper."
