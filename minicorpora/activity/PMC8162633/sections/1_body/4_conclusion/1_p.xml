<p id="Par14">The recent studies have shown that 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> can play a therapeutic role for COVID-19 by strengthening the immune and respiratory systems as well as inhibiting Covid-19 receptors. On the other hand, exercise training can have anti-inflammatory effects and improve immunity. Also, studies show that low to moderate intensity exercise training is useful for some respiratory diseases. Based on the previous research, it seems that a lifestyle combined with exercise training and 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> supplementation can be effective in reducing COVID-19 mortality.
