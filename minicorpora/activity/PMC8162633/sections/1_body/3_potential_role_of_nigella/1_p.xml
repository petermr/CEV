<p id="Par13">Lung tissue is one of the most important issues that are responsible for providing oxygen for oxidative phosphorylation during daily physical activity and exercise training. Exercise training and regular physical activity can strengthen the alveoli as well as the immune system associated with improving lung cells and ultimately functional capacity [

 <italic>N. sativa</italic> along with exercise training on COVID-19. Many common mechanisms of exercise training and 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> can affect COVID-19. It seems that consumption of black seed (black seed oil dose 40–80 mg/kg/day) along with regular aerobic exercise (40–60%

 <italic>N. sativa</italic> including TQ), which may play a prophylaxis and treatment role for COVID-19.
