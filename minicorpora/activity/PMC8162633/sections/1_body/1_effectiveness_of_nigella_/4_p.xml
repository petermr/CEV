<p id="Par8">It has been shown that TQ has the ability to block ACE2 (a COVID-19 receptor) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In other words, TQ may block the entry of COVID-19 into pneumocytes. Therefore, both nigellimine and thymoquinone from 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> may be considered as potentially active pharmacological components for the treatment of COVID-19. Recently, Rahman showed that 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic>, with a wide range of bioactive components, such as nigellimine and thymoquinone, may have many benefits in the treatment of COVID-19, including prevention of the virus enters the pneumocyte and prepares an ionophore for an enhanced uptake of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>, which can increase the host's immune response to COVID-19 and also prevent viral replication by blocking viral RdRp. This researcher suggested a dose of black seed oil between 40 and 80Â mg/kg per day as adjunctive therapy without any side effects [

 <italic>N. sativa</italic> reduces the coronavirus load in infected HeLa cells by stimulating IL-8 secretion and downregulation of expression of transient receptor potential (TRP) genes, such as TRPM6, TRPA1, TRPC4, and TRPM7 [
