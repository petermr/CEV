<p id="Par9">Some natural compounds may prevent the coronavirus from adhering to the host epithelial cell. It has been shown that Nigelledine, an 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> alkaloid, can block 6LU7, and α-Hederin, a saponin of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic>, can block 2GTB [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. As stated TQ is also one of the essential oils of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> that tends to bind to 6LU7, ACE2, and heat shock protein A5 active sites [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Also, Hederagenin (a saponin in 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic>) binds with 6LU7, 6Y2E, ACE2, and active sites of GRP78 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Thymohydroquinone showed moderate binding energy to SARS-CoV-2 6LU7, endoribonuclease, ADP-ribose-1-phosphatase, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, SARS-CoV-2 protein-binding domain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Nigellidine also showed high binding to COVID-19 enzymes and proteins, such as N-terminus-proteinase, 6LU7, nonstructural protein 2, spike-glycoprotein, and nucleocapsid. Nigellidine has a high affinity for inflammatory signal molecules and other proteins, such as human IL1R (1itb), TNFR1 (1ncf), and TNFR2 (3alq) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. According to this research, some components of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> provide the ability to inhibit the entry of coronavirus into lung cells and immunity, including nigellidine, α-hederin, hederagenin, thymohydroquinone, and thymoquinone.
