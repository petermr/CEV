<p id="Par3">Simultaneously with the involvement of lung tissue, the immune system usually reacts to fight the virus. It is stated that in COVID-19, changes in patients' immune systems are more similar. Usually, after COVID-19, a decrease in the number of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes, monocytes and platelets has been recorded with an increase in the number of neutrophils [

Therefore, strengthening and improving the function of lung cells, strengthening the immune system, and controlling pro-inflammatory cytokines can be suitable for the prevention or even treatment of COVID-19. There are lots of research that has been done on COVID-19, and they have proposed various treatment strategies. Meanwhile, exercise physiology scientists, especially molecular and cellular exercise physiologists, also use various exercise intensities as a preventive method for COVID-19 due to the positive effects of exercise training on the immune system [
