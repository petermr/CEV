 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It has been shown that COVID-19 causes wide mortality and has also irreparable economic damage to countries around the world. COVID-19 initially affects the cells of the small air sacs known as the alveoli. Alveoli are made up of alveolar cells (also known as pneumocytes) and alveolar macrophages. COVID-19 causes inflammation in the lung tissue, which is usually accompanied by symptoms such as dry cough, chest pain, fever, and difficulty breathing [
