<p id="Par10">In the recent decades, exercise and physical activity have been considered appropriate treatment options for respiratory and lung diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Exercise can increase functional capacity, increase exercise tolerance, and improve the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in lung disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms in patients with respiratory disorders [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Keyser et al. showed that aerobic exercise reduces the rate of fatigue in interstitial pulmonary disease (ILD) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Decreased fatigue was associated with an improvement in the patient's perception of fatigue and increased exercise capacity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Casaburi et al. also showed that in obstructive pulmonary disease, aerobic exercise (8-week, 90% aerobic threshold on cycle ergometer) reduces lactate acidosis and improves ventilation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. It has been shown that low and moderate intensity aerobic exercise (50 and 75% of maximal speed) reduces airway inflammation and improves lung remodeling in asthmatic mice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Aerobic exercise also reduces parenchymal artery inflammation. These effects of exercise on lung tissue may be due to a decrease in the Th2 response, an increase in interleukin-10, and a decrease in the expression of NF-KB, MCP-1, and IGF-I [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. It has been suggested that part of the effects of exercise on the immune system is due to the ability of exercise to modulate the cellular metabolism of lymphocytes, especially glucose and glutamine. It was observed that the change in lymphocyte function is associated with different effects of moderate exercise intensity (40â€“60%

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In particular, T lymphocytes increase glutamine intake by altering the metabolism of this amino acid to the aerobic pathway. At the same time, these cells reduce glucose intake and lactate production levels. In contrast, B lymphocytes showed that it increases the consumption of both glucose and glutamine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. All of these changes in lymphocytes can provide a stronger defense of lymphocytes against viruses. Owing to the wide cellular effects of exercise training on lung tissue, immune system, and viral diseases, it seems that it could be used to prevent viral diseases, especially COVID-19. Few studies have examined the preventive and even therapeutic effects of exercise on COVID-19.
