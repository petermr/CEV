<p id="Par11">As mentioned, one of the recognizable features in COVID-19 disease is cytokine storm which includes increase: IL-6, IL-1B, IL-2, IL-8, IL-17, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IFN-γ, IP10, MCP1, MIP1a, and TNF-α, and is known as an acute systemic inflammatory syndrome [

Among the effects of exercise training, especially aerobic exercise training (40 min each session, 3 times per week for 6 months; first 3 months = 60–70% of HRmax, second 3 months = 70–80% of HRma) is the strengthening of anti-inflammatory cytokines and the improvement of oxidative stress in elderly [

Their results showed that yoga reduced levels of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β as well as improved cellular and mucosal immunity in people who were suffering from inflammatory diseases [

An acute exercise session (moderate intensity less than 1 h) has been shown to activate immune system cells in the bloodstream and various tissues (such as mucosal surfaces including respiratory and gut epithelial), which strengthens the innate immune system [

Regular aerobic exercise (moderate intensity) also increases the antipathogenic activity of macrophages, which is associated with increased blood flow immunoglobulins, neutrophils, anti-inflammatory cytokines, immature B cells, the dramatic influx of natural killer cells (NK), and CD8 + T cells [

Exercise training has been known as a lifestyle factor that can maintain and even promote immune function and act like a vaccine against certain diseases/infections through producing physiological stress in the human body which lead to a series of adaptations occurring to overcome these stimuli [
