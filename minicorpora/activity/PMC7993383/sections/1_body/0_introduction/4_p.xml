 </xref>, we assessed herein the antitumor activity of ONP, C
 <bold>2</bold> and C
 <bold>3</bold>, and systematically reported a new mechanism by which ONP targets intracellular TrxR inhibition to cause oxidative stress-mediated tumor cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, the β-carbocation of the lactone ring in ONP covalently bound to the redox-active Sec residue at the C-terminus of TrxR, thereby leading to a decrease in TrxR activity. Importantly, carcinoma cells bearing high levels of oxidative stress and overexpressing TrxR under pathological conditions were selectively killed by ONP, showing a perfect antitumor effect. Moreover, the silence of TrxR expression by RNA interference enhanced the observed cytotoxicity of ONP while overexpression of the enzyme reduced the potency of ONP, thereby supporting that TrxR is essentially involved in the cellular effects of ONP. A novel TrxR inhibitor for the first time was isolated from
