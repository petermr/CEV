<p>Since we have well verified the interaction site of ONP and TrxR, and this interaction highly caused ONP to suppress both pure TrxR and intracellular TrxR activity. In particular, ONP inhibited TrxR activity in cells, inevitably limiting the function of cellular TrxR. Therefore, when the tumor cells were further stressed, the cellular anti-oxidation ability was partially weakened. As a consequence, the upper limit of tumor cell vulnerability to ROS toxicity may be broken, finally leading to oxidative stress-mediated carcinoma cell apoptosis. The biological behavior of ONP targeting TrxR reasonably contribute to the cytotoxicity of ONP towards tumor cells. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0007">Figure 7(A)</xref>, the survival rate of ONP on HeLa cells we determined previously had a certain extent correlation with its inhibitory rate on intracellular TrxR activity. To validate this correlation, we employed the HeLa-
 <italic>shTrxR1</italic> that had previously knocked down TrxR expression in HeLa cells and the control cell line HeLa-

 </xref>. After ONP at a concentration of 20 and 40 µM acted respectively on HeLa-
 <italic>shTrxR1</italic> with low TrxR expression and HeLa-
 <italic>shNT</italic> with empty plasmid cells, the results showed that the cytotoxicity of ONP at the same concentration to HeLa-
 <italic>shTrxR1</italic> cells was remarkably increased compared with HeLa-
 <italic>shNT</italic> cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0007">Figure 7(B)</xref>), which means TrxR participated in the physiological process of ONP inhibiting the growth of HeLa cells. Correspondingly, overexpression of the functional TrxR protein in HEK-
 <italic>TrxR1</italic> cells rendered the cytotoxicity of ONP to decrease when ONP at a concentration of 40 µM was used to act on the HEK-
 <italic>TrxR1</italic> overexpressing TrxR and the control cell line HEK-
 <italic>IRES</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0007">Figure 7(C)</xref>). Attenuation of cytotoxicity by ONP towards the HEK-
 <italic>TrxR1</italic> cell line illustrated further that TrxR was involved in the intracellular process of ONP. Taken together, our data supported that targeting TrxR strongly contributes to the cytotoxicity of ONP.
