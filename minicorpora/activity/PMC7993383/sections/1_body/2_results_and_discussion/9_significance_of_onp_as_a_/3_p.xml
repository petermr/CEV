<p>We herein isolated ONP, C
 <bold>2</bold> and C
 <bold>3</bold> from 
 <italic>Shangwua</italic> for the first time, indicating that sesquiterpene lactones may be one of its primary secondary components (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>). Intriguingly, these three compounds, 
 <italic>e.g.</italic> ONP with significant cytotoxicity, C
 <bold>2</bold> with weaker cytotoxicity, and C
 <bold>3</bold> with almost no cytotoxicity, harbor significant differences in cytotoxicity towards tumor cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(A)</xref>). We revealed the reasons for the difference in their antitumor activity from the perspective of compound functional groups and described the antitumor mechanism of ONP targeting TrxR (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figures 5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">6</xref>). Mechanistically, our results revealed that ONP selectively acts on the alteration of redox homeostasis of carcinoma cells, thereby selectively killing tumor cells 
 <italic>via</italic> apoptosis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figures 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">4</xref>). The ability of ONP to vary the redox homeostasis of carcinoma cells was connected with targeting intracellular main antioxidant enzyme TrxR (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0008">Figure 8</xref>). Importantly, we not only demonstrated the interaction site of ONP and TrxR but also confirmed that TrxR is involved in the cytotoxicity of ONP. Our data supported that α, β unsaturated ketone in the ONP and the Sec residues with stronger nucleophilicity of the enzyme are the sites of action of both. Selective inhibition of TrxR activity impaired TrxR function in cells, resulting in a series of changes in intracellular redox levels to contribute to the antitumor activity of ONP.
