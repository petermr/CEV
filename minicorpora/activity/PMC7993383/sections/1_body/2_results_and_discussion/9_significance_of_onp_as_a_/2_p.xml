<p>Isolation and identification of bioactive molecules in natural products and uncovering their action mechanisms are of great significance to the discovery and development of medicinal value for secondary metabolites and natural plants. As the first major family of dicots, 
 <italic>Asteraceae</italic> contains numerous genera and species, and most of their medicinal value and secondary metabolites have been systematically studied
