<p>The dried whole plant (2.375 kg) of 
 <italic>Shangwua</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1(A)</xref>) was pulverized and extracted with 95% ethanol (3 × 5 L) at room temperature. The mixture was later filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to provide a crude extract (152.8 g). Subsequently, the crude extract was extracted with ethyl acetate, and the resulting extract (98.9 g) was eluted with ethanol/water (30, 50, 80, 90 and 100%) through macroporous adsorption resin. The 80% ethanol eluted fraction was subjected to silica gel column chromatography and eluted with petroleum ether/acetone to obtain six sub-fractions (Fr. A-F). The Fr. B subfraction was eluted through a reversed-phase silica gel column with a gradient of methanol: water (3:7–0:1). The Fr.B3 part obtained above was separated by Sephadex LH-20 and semi-preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to finally obtain the pure compound 
 <bold>1</bold> (20 mg). Likewise, Fr. E subfraction was directly separated by reversed-phase silica gel column and semi-preparative HPLC (methanol: water = 3:2) to obtain compound 
 <bold>2</bold> (6 mg). Subsequently, the Fr. D subcomponent was eluted by normal phase silica gel (petroleum ether: acetone = 3:1-1:1) to obtain Fr. D2. Then, Fr. D2. was separated and purified by Sephadex LH-20 and semi-preparative HPLC to obtain compound 
 <bold>3</bold> (10 mg).
