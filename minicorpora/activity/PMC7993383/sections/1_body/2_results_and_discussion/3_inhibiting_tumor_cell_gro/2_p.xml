<p>Given that the lack of research on 
 <italic>Shangwua</italic> and its secondary metabolites, we urgently tested the cytotoxicity of the preceding three isolated compounds on tumor cells. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(A)</xref>, the result showed that ONP can significantly inhibit the growth of human cervical cancer HeLa cell line with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 20 µM at 48 h. However, C
 <bold>2</bold> has little cytotoxicity and C
 <bold>3</bold> is almost non-cytotoxic under our experimental conditions towards HeLa cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(A)</xref>). In addition, the cytotoxicity of ONP towards HeLa cells also exhibited a time dependence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(B)</xref>). To further confirm the cytotoxicity of ONP to tumor cells, we selected human liver cancer cell line HepG 2 and human lung cancer cell line A549, together with HeLa cells, to assess the growth inhibitory effect of ONP on the tumor cells. Satisfactory results presented that ONP had a remarkable activity of repressing the growth of tumor cells on the above tumor cell lines after 48 h incubation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(C)</xref>). More noteworthy is that ONP could selectively kill tumor cells but was less cytotoxicity to normal cells such as human lung epithelial cells BEAS-2B and human liver epithelial cells L02 under the same experimental conditions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(D)</xref>). These results indicated that ONP, C
 <bold>2</bold> and C
 <bold>3</bold> isolated from 
 <italic>Shangwua</italic> have radically different cytotoxicity to HeLa cells due to diversities in their structural fragments. Moreover, ONP with a unique cytotoxic selectivity established by these data deserves a further investigation of its action mechanism for ablating tumor cells.
