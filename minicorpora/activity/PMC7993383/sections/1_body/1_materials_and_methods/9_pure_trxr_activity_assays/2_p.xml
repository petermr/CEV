<p>The NADPH-reduced TrxR (170 nM) or U498C TrxR (700 nM) was incubated with 0, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 µM of ONP or C
 <bold>3</bold> in a 96-well plate at room temperature for 0.5, 1, or 2 h, and the final incubation volume of the mixture was 50 µL. Then added 50 µL TE buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) containing 2 mM DTNB and 200 µM NADPH, recorded the linear increase during the initial 3 min in absorbance at 412 nm
