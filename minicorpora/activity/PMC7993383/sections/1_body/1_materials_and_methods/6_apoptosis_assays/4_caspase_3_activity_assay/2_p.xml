<p>HeLa cells were treated with indicated concentrations of ONP for 24 h. The cells were then collected and lysed with RIPA buffer. Total cellular protein contents were quantified by the Bradford procedure. The extracts containing 60 µg of total proteins were incubated with the protease activity assay mixture (0.2 mM Ac-DEVD-pNA, 0.1% CHAPS, 5% glycerol, 2 mM EDTA and 10 mM DTT in 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5) at 37 °C for 2 h in a final volume of 100 µL. The caspase 3 activity was determined by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm.</p>
