<p>DCFH-DA or DHE probes were employed to assess ROS level. HeLa cells (2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>) were plated into a 12-well plate and allowed to adhere. HeLa cells were incubated with 0, 20, or 40 µM ONP for 5 h, then removed the medium and subsequently treated with DCFH-DA (10 µM) or DHE (10 µM) in fresh FBS-free medium for 30 min at 37 °C in dark. The images were acquired on a fluorescent microscope (Floid Cell Imaging Station, Thermo Fisher).
