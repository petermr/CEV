<p id="Par29">As clearly depicted in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, the extracts and isolated compounds from the roots and leaves of 
 <italic>O. cufodontii</italic> show differences in the inhibition of growth of bacterial strains. The absolute values of the diameter zones of inhibition (DZI) varied from 6.00 to 19.04 ± 0.10 mm. The hexane extract of the leaves of 
 <italic>O. cufodontii</italic> displayed DZI of 12 0.01 mm while the EtOAc and MeOH extract showed DZI of each 8.00 mm indicating that the active constituents are likely residing in the non-polar fraction of the leaves of 
 <italic>O. cufodontii</italic>. Likewise the hexane, EtOAc and MeOH extract of the roots exhibited DZI of 17.09, 13.00 and 15.04 mm against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, respectively. The results displayed by the roots extracts are superior compared with that of the leaves of 
 <italic>O. cufodontii.</italic> Compounds 1, 3 and 4 were also evaluated for their antibacterial activity and better inhibition was observed against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> with DZI of 12.02, 14.01, and 15.02 mm, respectively. The latter exhibited good activity with both Gram positive and gram negative bacteria. Therefore, the antibacterial activity displayed by the extracts of roots of 
 <italic>O. cufodontii</italic> reveals the presence of compound 
 <bold>3</bold> and 
 <bold>4</bold>.
