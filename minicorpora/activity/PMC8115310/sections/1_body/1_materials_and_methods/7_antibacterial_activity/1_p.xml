 </sup>. The bacterial strains including 
 <italic>Escherichia coli, Klebsella pneumonia, Salmonella typhymurium</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> were the American type culture collection obtained from Oromia Public Health Research, Capacity Building and Quality Assurance Laboratory Center, Adama, Ethiopia. Wells have been made in nutrient agar plate using cork borer (6 mm diameter) and inoculums containing 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL of bacteria have been spread on the solid plates with a sterile swab moistened with the bacterial suspension and each 50 µg/mL of the extracts and isolated compounds were filled in the wells with the help of micropipette. Plates have been left for some time till the samples diffuse in the medium with the lid closed and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After overnight incubation, the plates were observed for the zone of inhibition (ZI) and the diameter of the inhibition zone was measured using scale. Then the samples were analyzed in triplicates and expressed as mean ± SD. Ciprofloxacin and DMSO were used as positive and negative controls, respectively.
