 </sup>. Briefly, the methanol solution of the hexane extract was serially diluted with 0.004% DPPH in methanol to furnish 200, 100, 50, and 25 µg/mL of the extract. After 30 min incubation in an oven at 37 °C, absorbance at 517 nm was measured using UV–Vis spectrophotometer. Ascorbic acid and 0.004% DPPH in methanol were used as positive control and blank, respectively. The percentage inhibition of the extracts was calculated using the following formula. % Inhibition = (A
 <sub>control</sub> − A
 <sub>extract</sub>)/A
 <sub>control</sub> × 100 where Acontrol is the absorbance of 0.004% DPPH in methanol and Aextract is the absorbance of DPPH solution plus sample. The DPPH radical scavenging activity of the samples was also expressed as IC
 <sub>50</sub>, the concentration of the test compound to give a 50% decrease of the absorbance from that of the control solution. The radical scavenging activity of the other extracts and the isolated compounds of the leaves and the roots of 
 <italic>O. cufodontii</italic> were also evaluated following the same. Ascorbic acid and quercetin were used as positive controls.
