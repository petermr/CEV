<p>Considering that five types of drying methods (shade, sun, freeze, microwave, and oven‐drying) were used in this experiment, plant samples were divided into five groups to ensure the uniformity of plant materials in the treatments. In the case of shade‐drying, natural airflow, and ambient temperature were implemented (temperature = 26 ± 2°C). Where sun‐drying was used, the samples were dried under direct sunlight at temperature between 27°C and 37°C for 4 days in July in Tabriz, Iran. Freeze‐drying was performed in a laboratory freeze‐dryer for duration of 8 hr at −52°C. Microwave‐drying was carried out using a digital microwave oven at 600 W. Oven‐drying was carried out at two different temperatures (40, 60, and 80°C).</p>
