<p>The antioxidant capacity of 
 <italic>S. lavandulifolia</italic> EO was evaluated by two supplementary in vitro measurements, which demonstrated the IC
 <sub>50</sub> contents of the assayed EOs determined in DPPH and RP assays. The outcomes indicated that all EOs studied had significant antioxidant attributes, and additionally that drying techniques effect affirmatively the antioxidant power of 
 <italic>S. lavandulifolia</italic> EO (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn32218-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In fact, the best portion in the DPPH and RP measure was attained by the EOs acquired from 
 <italic>S. lavandulifolia</italic> when freeze‐dried (IC
 <sub>50</sub> amounts 101.8 ± 0.8 mg/ml and 315.2 ± 2.1 mg/ml, respectively), followed by those extracted from the samples dried in shade (IC
 <sub>50</sub> amounts 103.3 ± 0.5 mg/ml and 321.2 ± 2.3 mg/ml, respectively). The minimum activities were registered by the oven‐dried samples (at 80°C) with IC
 <sub>50</sub> amounts of 180.3 ± 2.7 mg/ml and 495.2 ± 3.8 mg/ml, respectively. The EOs acquired from samples dried in the microwave indicated intermediate antioxidant activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 120.0 ± 1.1 mg/ml and 340.5 ± 3.2 mg/ml, respectively). In addition, as anticipated, none of the EOs studied were as strong as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 24.5 ± 0.1 mg/ml and 45.6 ± 0.2 mg/ml, respectively).
