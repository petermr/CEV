<p id="Par5">The phytochemical assessment of 
 <italic>A. nilagirica</italic> showed the presence of different phytoconstituents namely tannins, alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids, amino acids, glycosides, and quinines, etc. (Arokiyaraj et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2012</xref>; Rani et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR284">2012</xref>). Numerous secondary metabolites like terpenoids, flavonoids, polysaccharides as well as saponins have been characterized as well as authenticated by using High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectroscopy (GC–MS), and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) (Xie et al.
