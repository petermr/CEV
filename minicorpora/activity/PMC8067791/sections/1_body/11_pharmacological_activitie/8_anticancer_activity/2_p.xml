<p id="Par27">It was also found that 
 <italic>A. sacrorum</italic> Ledeb has five types of flavonoid contents, namely kaempferol, Jaceosidin, luteolin, quercetin, and quercitrin. Two flavonoids obtained from the dichloromethane portion and other flavonoids from the 95% ethyl ether portions were analyzed for anticancer effects on human SK-Hep 1 hepatoma cancer cells human and HeLa cervical cancer cells. Two flavonoids have possessed significant anticancer activity against the HeLa cells line (Yuan et al.

 <italic>n</italic>-butanol, water, and methanol extract of 
 <italic>A. armeniaca</italic> on two myeloid cell lines, apoptosis-proficient HL60 cells, apoptosis-resistant K562 cells, and J774 cells as a control (Mojarrab et al.

 <italic>A. monosperma</italic> essential oil has an apoptotic cell in the human melanoma A375 cell line in-vitro anticancer effect on colorectal breast cancer cell lines by polyacetylene dehydrofal carindiol. Capillin (1-phenyl-2,4-pentadiyne), one more polyacetylene present in 
 <italic>A. monosperma</italic>, was validated to persuade apoptosis in various human cancer cell lines like pancreatic MIA PaCa-2, colon HT29, lung carcinoma A549 cells, epidermoid carcinoma of the larynx HEp-2 (Stavri et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR321">2014</xref>). Based on the above study artemisinin and its spinoffs have also been introduced as possible cancer treatments that affect multiple pathways. They are known to arrest the cell cycle, induce apoptosis, and slow cell proliferation. At lower concentrations, artemisinin is associated with the symbol of oncosis-like cell death. However, when the concentration increases, it promoted apoptosis in cells. The accumulation of artemisinin inside lysosomes and mitochondria has also been found to play a role in cell death (Du et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2010</xref>). As per the literature, the alkylating activity of artemisinin is due to the presence of the endoperoxide bridge in the structure of artemisinin that reacts with the heme group and iron. Artemisinin is capable to arrest the cell cycle, induce apoptosis, and slow cell proliferation. The accrual of artemisinin inside lysosomes and mitochondria has also been found to play a role in cell death (Konstat-Korzenny et al.
