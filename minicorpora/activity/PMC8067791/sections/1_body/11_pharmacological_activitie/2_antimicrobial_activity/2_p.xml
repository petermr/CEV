<p id="Par20">The inhibitory effect against 
 <italic>P. capsici</italic> is due to the presence of thujones about 41.9%. It has been illustrated that similar activity has been done by utilizing cedar leaf oil and 
 <italic>A. nilagirica</italic> oil (Shafi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR304">2004</xref>). The plant extracts have shown extended activity against 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus typhi</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>Cida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus,</italic> and 
 <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic>. It has been reported that 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> exhibited the largest zone of inhibition at 16, 17, 19 mm at 100, 150–200 µg concentrations serially. 
 <italic>B. subtilis, S. typhi</italic> displayed inhibition zones of 14, 16 and 18 mm, pursued by 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> with 13, 15, and 18 mm at three separate concentrations (100, 150, and 200 µg). 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> showed the zone of inhibition (14, 15 and 17 mm) at 100, 150 and 200 µg, serially. The microbial characteristics of 
 <italic>A. nilagirica</italic> were reported by numerous investigational groups; it possesses potent antibacterial activity towards 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus,</italic> and 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic> (Rao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR285">2006</xref>).
