<p id="Par32">The antimalarial effect of the organic extract of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> was for both antiparasitic and its other actions and at different doses (250, 500, 1000 mg/kg). There has been performed 4-day suppressive assay when extract has applied orally at 500 mg/kg, 1000 mg/kg doses to mice then it was found that there has been remarkably prohibited parasitaemia by 65.16% and 51.46%. The 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> extract to administered to mice for 14 days (assay of sub-chronic toxicity), no ostensible symptoms of toxicity were seen. Hepatotoxicity serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) has been estimated in respect of serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) levels, renotoxicity (in respect of creatinine serum urea), haematotoxicity in respect of entire white blood cells and red blood cells (WBC and RBC), as well as differential leukocyte counts, were also precluded. Finally, 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> leaf extract was considered to be orally proficient, non-lethal and it can be an inexpensive origin of plant antimalarial (Kalkanidis et al.
