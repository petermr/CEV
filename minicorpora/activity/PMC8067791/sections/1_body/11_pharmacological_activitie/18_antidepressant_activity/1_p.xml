<p id="Par43">Several investigational reports have demonstrated the medicinal property of phenolic compounds, chlorogenic acid, syringic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, vanillic acid, kaempferol, rutin, luteolin, quercetin, and catechin in the cure of mental illness. Since these secondary metabolites are considered as the phenolic agents emerged from 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> and 
 <italic>Stachys lavulifolia</italic>. Antidepressant properties of the extracts were examined in the forced swimming test (FST) along with the tail suspension test (TST) (Ahangar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2011</xref>; Akkol et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2019</xref>). An open field test was performed to examine the usual locomotor actions in ice complying treatment with the extracts. Remarkable activity between the phenolic contents of the extracts was not observed, whereas 
 <italic>S. lavulifolia</italic> demonstrated good activity due to excess flavonoid contents. Animal treated with extracts reduced the immobility duration in FST, as well as TST, collated to the vehicle group excluding any promising impression on the locomotor action of animals (Aslam 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2016</xref>). Moreover, 
 <italic>S. lavulifolia</italic> at 400Â mg/kg concentration demonstrated enhanced efficacy in both tests connoted to 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> (Khosravi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR175">2017</xref>). Some important research reports contributed prodigious substantiation on the antidepressant resembling the action of both extracts, which could be concerned with flavonoids as the prime constituents of the extracts (Jahani et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">2019</xref>).
