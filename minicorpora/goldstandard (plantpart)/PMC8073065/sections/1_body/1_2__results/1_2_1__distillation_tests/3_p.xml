<p>Within each one of the periods considered (1–7 days, 15–30 days and 100–120 days), the variability between distillations was rather high, as can be noticed in the values of the relative standard deviation (15.5% in the first period, 21.9% in the second period and 13.0% in the third one). It can be considered a normal variability between bales, related to variations in the proportion of young twigs and wood, rather than because of the time that elapses after harvesting.</p>
