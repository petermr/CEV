 <italic>Cistus ladanifer</italic> secretes a large amount of exudate from its leaves and photosynthetic stems through trichomes. This exudate is characterised by two families of secondary metabolites, flavonoids and diterpenoids [

 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-02379" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] which depends on the concentration of these metabolites, whose synthesis is conditioned not only by environmental factors but also by an intrapopulation variation [
