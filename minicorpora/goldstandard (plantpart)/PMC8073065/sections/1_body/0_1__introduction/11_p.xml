<p>Taking into account a new framework in which mechanised harvesting is used in a sustainable way and higher harvesting yields are obtained in comparison to manual labour, higher storage periods before the distillation would be needed to carry out an appropriate management of the 
 <italic>Cistus ladanifer</italic> logistics. The mechanised harvesting assays in 
 <italic>Cistus ladanifer</italic> shrubland performed by CEDER-CIEMAT have allowed workers to collect the aboveground plant biomass in round big bale format and store the bales for long periods of time. The effect of the storage of this plant on the steam distillation process has not been reported previously. Therefore, the objective of this work is to study the influence of the storage period of mechanically harvested 
 <italic>Cistus ladanifer</italic> bales on the distillation yield and on the essential oil composition in a pilot scale steam distillation plant.
