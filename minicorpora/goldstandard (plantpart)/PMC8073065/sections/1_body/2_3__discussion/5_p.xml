<p>The total compounds identified in the essential oils analysed are similar in all three cases (94.39%, 94.15% and 92.30%). Moreover, the biomass origin and the pretreatment and distillation operating conditions remained constant in all the experiments. Consequently, it can be highlighted that when the storage period increases, the percentages of total monoterpene hydrocarbons and total oxygenated monoterpenes tend to decrease while the percentages of total oxygenated sesquiterpenes tend to increase, especially when the samples corresponding to 0–7 days and 100–120 days (14.57% vs. 18.64%) are compared. Taking into account the different compounds, α-pinene, verbenene, limonene and β-phellandrene are the monoterpene hydrocarbons with the higher decrease. Regarding the sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, the change is not remarkable in any of the compounds identified. Finally, within the oxygenated sesquiterpenes, the increase in viridiflorol and ledol can be highlighted. However, it is interesting to note that no qualitative differences were observed in the composition of the essential oil in the different storage periods.</p>
