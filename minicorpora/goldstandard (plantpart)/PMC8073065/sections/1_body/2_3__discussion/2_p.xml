<p>Although the decrease in the essential oil yield over the period considered is not statistically significant, a decrease of 12.0% with regard to the fresh plant distillation is observed when the storage is between 15 and 30 days, and a decrease of 30.7% when the storage period is between 100 and 120 days. Considering the literature [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-26-02379" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], it could be due to the volatilisation of some compounds during the storage or to the biomass biodegradation caused by physiological deterioration and other factors. The first alternative seems to be a more likely reason if we attend to the reduction in the monoterpenes from 60.92% to 56.50%, and oxygenated monoterpenes, from 10.34% to 8.15%, as can be seen in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02379-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. In addition, neither mouldiness nor other visual alterations were observed after the storage, and no temperature increases were detected inside the bales either.
