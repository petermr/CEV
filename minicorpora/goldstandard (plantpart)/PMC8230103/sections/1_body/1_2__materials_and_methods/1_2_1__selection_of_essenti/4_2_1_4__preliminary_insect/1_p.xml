<p>To select the most active EOs, preliminary insecticidal activity was determined by the “
 <italic>vial in vial</italic>” method reported in the literature [
 <xref rid="B20-insects-12-00532" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A volume of 11 µL of EOs was applied to a 2 cm diameter Whatman
 <sup>®</sup> No. 1 filter paper placed on top of a 1.5 mL glass vial. Subsequently, the vial was introduced into a 22 mL vial with a screw-type closure containing 10 insects without sexing, leaving a final concentration of essential oils of 500 μL/L air. As positive controls, Nuvan 50
 <sup>®</sup> (Sanigral Ltda. Bogotá, Colombia), containing dichlorvox as the active ingredient (100 μL/L air), and Fosfamin
 <sup>®</sup> (Fumitoro Ltda. Bogotá, Colombia), with phosphine as the active ingredient (150 µL/L air), were used. The negative control was applied in the same way, but without the addition of any substance. All tests were performed in triplicate under controlled temperature and humidity conditions (27 ± 1 °C and 65 ± 5% HR). Insect mortality was determined after 24 h. The insects were considered dead when observed with a stereoscope with no movement of the legs and/or the antennae seen after stimulation for 15 s with an entomological pin. The mortality percentages (%M) were calculated using the Abbott’s [
