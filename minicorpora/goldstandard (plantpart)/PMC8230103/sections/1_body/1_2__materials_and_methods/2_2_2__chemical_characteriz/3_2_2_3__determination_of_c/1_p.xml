<p>The chemical constituents were determined by comparing the mass spectra and retention indices obtained for each compound with those reported in the Pherobase database [
 <xref rid="B22-insects-12-00532" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and those published in the literature [
 <xref rid="B23-insects-12-00532" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The linear retention indices (RI) were calculated, using a homologous series of hydrocarbons from C
 <sub>8</sub> to C
 <sub>26</sub>, and eluted under the same operational conditions described for EOs.
