<p>In the first analysis, a DB-5MS column ((5%)-phenyl-methylpolysiloxane, 60 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm) was used, with injection in Split mode (20:1) for 1.5 min. The temperature ramp started at 40 °C for 2 min, and then it was increased to 123 °C (4 °C/min) and remained constant for 2 min. Afterward, it increased to 160 °C (4 °C/min), remained constant for 5 min, was subsequently increased to 220 °C (5 °C/min), and then kept constant for 8 min. Finally, it was increased to 280 °C (5 °C/min) and kept constant for 4 min, for a total run time of 75 min. In the second analysis, a HP-INNOWax column (polyethylene glycol (PEG), 60 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm) was used, with injection in Split mode (20:1) for 1.5 min. The temperature ramp started at 45 °C for 4 min, and then it was increased to 120 °C (3 °C/min) and remained constant for 2 min. Finally, it was increased to 250 °C (4 °C/min) and kept constant for 8 min, for a total time of 71.5 min. The injection volume used in each analysis was 1 µL.</p>
