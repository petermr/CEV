<p>Based on classification using the cluster method, for the final sample, composed of 14 EOs with the highest fumigant potential, the lethal concentrations (LC
 <sub>30</sub>, LC
 <sub>50</sub>, and LC
 <sub>90</sub>) were estimated by adjusting a Probit model. Subsequently, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine if there were significant differences in lethal concentrations. Then, through a post hoc analysis of Tukey, it was determined that groups of oils had marked differences in lethal concentrations. Finally, the compounds that were most correlated with mortality were determined through the Wald statistic.
