<p>Essential oils with a mortality percent ≥40% (24 EOs) and 19 of their individual constituents (ICs) were subjected to fumigant activity evaluation by the modified “
 <italic>vial in vial</italic>” method. In this test, contact of the insect with the EO or IC was avoided. To achieve this, the vial with the paper impregnated with EO was placed and covered with a sheer curtain or a 15% PTFE solution [

The same conditions of the previous trial were reproduced to evaluate the EOs: 11 µL (500 µL/L air) of EO, 24-h mortality reading, and three replicates. For the ICs, quantities between 3.0–5.0 μL were applied in 1.5 cm-diameter filter paper rings (Whatman
 <sup>®</sup>) located at the bottom of the screw cap of a 22 mL amber vial, leaving a final concentration of 150 ppm (0.6–1.1 mM (mmol/L of air)). EOs and ICs with a mortality percent ≥60% were selected for continuing the study. The percentage of mortality was calculated using Equation (1). All treatments were replicated five times under the same temperature and humidity conditions. To determine if there were significant differences between the mortality caused by EOs in the preliminary insecticidal activity assay and in the fumigant assay, a non-parametric analysis was performed with the Mann–Whitney test.
