<p>To obtain results that allowed for estimating the lethal concentrations, different quantities of EOs or ICs were used. For EO quantities, between 1.1–18 µL of EO (50–818 µL/L air) were employed. In the case of compounds, the filter papers were impregnated with different amounts (0.10–4.00 μL) of pure compound and placed in the bottom of the screw cap of a glass vial of 22, 140, 270, or 518 mL, according to each concentration [
