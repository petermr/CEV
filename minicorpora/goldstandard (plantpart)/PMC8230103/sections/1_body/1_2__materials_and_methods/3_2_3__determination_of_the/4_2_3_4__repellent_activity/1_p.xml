<p>The repellent action was measured using an olfactometer with static air, consisting of two 290 mL bottles connected by a tube (l = 6 cm, d = 0.7 cm), with a container (44 mL) located in the central part of the duct (

 <sup>®</sup> No. 1 paper disc impregned with different volumes of EO, corresponding to concentrations between 6.2–22.7 μL/L of air. In the other bottle was placed a 1.5 mL vial with paper without EO, and this acted as a control. Adult 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic> insects (20 per assembly) were incorporated through the central container of the connecting tube. The test was executed in darkness, and the olfactometer was rotated in order to make sure that the behavior of the insects only depended on the repellent action. The activity reading was done at 2, 6, and 24 h after the application, and the number of insects present in both containers (treated and untreated) were recorded. All treatments were performed in triplicate [
