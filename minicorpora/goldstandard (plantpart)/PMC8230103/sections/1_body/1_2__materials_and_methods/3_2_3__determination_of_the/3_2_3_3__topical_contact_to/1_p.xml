<p>The contact toxicity was determined by the topical contact method, which consisted of applying different amounts of EOs (0.10, 0.15, and 0.20 µL) with a micro-syringe on the insect’s prothorax. Untreated insects were used as negative controls, and Nuvan 50
 <sup>®</sup> was used as a positive control at a volume of 0.10 µL. The treated insects were transferred to 22 mL glass vials, leaving 10 insects per vial. The vials were kept in the culture chamber under controlled temperature and humidity conditions (27 ± 1 °C and 65 ± 5% RH). All treatments were performed in triplicate, and insect mortality was determined after 24 h [
