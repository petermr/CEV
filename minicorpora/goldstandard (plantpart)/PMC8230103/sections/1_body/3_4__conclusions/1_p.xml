<p>This study contributes to the chemical and insecticidal characterization of EOs from aromatic plants and shows their potential as effective alternatives for the control of 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic>. The results indicated that the oils with the greatest fumigant potential were those obtained from 
 <italic>L. stoechas</italic> and 
 <italic>L. alba</italic>. The oxygenated monoterpenes R-(+)-pulegone, S-(-)-pulegone, and R-(-)-carvone were the ICs with the highest fumigant potential. These substances (EOs and ICs) had low lethal concentrations and did not require large variations in their concentrations to significantly increase insect mortality. The EOs with higher contact toxicity were characterized by a high content of sesquiterpenoids and phenylpropanoids. Although most EOs had a high percentage of repellency, there was no clear link between chemical composition and repellent effect.
