<p>The maize weevil, 
 <italic>Sitophilus zeamais</italic> Motsch (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is one of the most important pests of stored grains, responsible for the primary damage of maize [
 <xref rid="B4-insects-12-00532" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It is estimated that an average of two insects per grain generate 18.3% losses in 48 days. The greatest damage to the grain is caused by larvae and adults; eggs are laid during most of the adult life, although 50% can be laid in the first 5 weeks of an adultâ€™s life [
 <xref rid="B5-insects-12-00532" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-insects-12-00532" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The female drills the grain to oviposit in small, chewed cavities that are subsequently sealed by a secretion, protecting the individual to complete their life cycle within it. Owing to this, most strategies are focused on adult control [

 <xref rid="B8-insects-12-00532" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Infestations of this species result in weight loss, decreased germination power, and reduced levels of nutrients, taste, and smell in the grains [
 <xref rid="B9-insects-12-00532" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition, high temperature and humidity conditions allow the proliferation of other insect species and microorganisms [

 <xref rid="B11-insects-12-00532" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Different strategies are used to control 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic>, chemical control being the most effective one. A factor that plays an important role in chemical control is the mode of application, which depends on the ecology of the insect as well as the characteristics of the place or product where the treatment is to be applied. In storing grain in bulk in warehouses or silos it is difficult to prevent and control insect infestations [
 <xref rid="B10-insects-12-00532" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In this sense, insecticides with fumigant action are the most effective method for controlling pests in stored products, because due to their high volatility they can spread throughout the air space of the silo and reach areas that would not otherwise be accessible [
 <xref rid="B12-insects-12-00532" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, commercial pesticides are usually not very selective, and many are toxic to the environment and harmful to health [
 <xref rid="B13-insects-12-00532" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-insects-12-00532" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Therefore, the development of effective and safe alternatives for the control of this stored grain pest is required.
