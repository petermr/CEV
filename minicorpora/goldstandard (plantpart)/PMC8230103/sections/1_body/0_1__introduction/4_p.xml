<p>Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the insecticidal activity of EOs from 45 species of plants present in Colombia, belonging to 16 families, against adult weevils of 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic>. First, preliminary insecticidal activity was evaluated to select the most active EOs (24) and perform their chemical characterization. Then, to establish if the mortality of EOs was caused by fumigant or contact toxicity, a test in which contact between the insect and the oil was avoided was performed, as well as making a topical contact assay. Later, a cluster statistical analysis was carried out to group the EOs according to their insecticidal activity (fumigant and contact toxicity) and repellence. To the group of EOs that mainly exerted a fumigant effect, lethal concentrations (LC) were estimated. Finally, the compounds present in EOs with the best fumigant effect were selected, and their fumigant activity was also evaluated.
