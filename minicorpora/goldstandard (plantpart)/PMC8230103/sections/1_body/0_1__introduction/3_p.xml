<p>Nowadays, interest in bioprospecting studies has increased as a potential strategy to find new applications for biodiversity. Furthermore, countries privileged with natural resources might improve their inherent capacities to strengthen economic activities such as safer and healthier agriculture [

 <xref rid="B18-insects-12-00532" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It is important to consider that bioactivity of EOs is directly related to their chemical composition, which can vary dramatically, even within the same plant species. In fact, sources of compositional variability can include the plant part extracted, the phenological state of the plant, and the season, as well as growth environment conditions [
