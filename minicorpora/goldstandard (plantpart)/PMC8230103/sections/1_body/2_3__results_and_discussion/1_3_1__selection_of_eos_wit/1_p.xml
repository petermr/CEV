<p>The preliminary insecticidal assay performed for EOs from 45 plant species belonging to 16 families, using the “
 <italic>vial in vial</italic>” method at a maximum concentration of 500 µL/L air, allowed identification of 24 EOs with potential insecticidal activity that caused mortality ≥40% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00532-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The EOs that exhibited the highest mortality rates (&gt;90%) were those extracted from 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic>, 
 <italic>L. stoechas</italic>, 
 <italic>S. viminea</italic>, 
 <italic>M. septentrionalis</italic>, 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> sp., and 
 <italic>L. alba</italic>. For the 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> EO, it has been reported that it exerts fumigant, repellent, and toxic effects upon contact with different species of the genus 
 <italic>Sitophilus</italic>, effects that have been attributed to the presence of 1,8-cineole and camphor [

 <xref rid="B29-insects-12-00532" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Essential oils of the genus 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> with a high content of 1,8-cineole have also exhibited fumigant and repellent activity against species of the genus 
 <italic>Sitophilus</italic> [

 <xref rid="B31-insects-12-00532" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In addition, potential toxic contact activity on 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic> has been reported for the essential oil of 
 <italic>L. alba</italic>, an effect attributed to its high limonene content [
 <xref rid="B32-insects-12-00532" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. For the essential oils of 
 <italic>M. septentrionalis</italic> (%M = 97), 
 <italic>S. viminea</italic> (%M = 94), 
 <italic>L. stoechas</italic> (%M = 93), 
 <italic>X. discreta</italic> (%M = 73), 
 <italic>P. el-metanum</italic> (%M = 70), 
 <italic>A. cumanensis</italic> (%M = 40) and 
 <italic>P. nubigenum</italic> (%M = 40), the insecticidal activity on 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic> is reported for the first time.
