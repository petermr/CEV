 <italic>L. stoechas</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aduncum</italic>, 
 <italic>C. nardus</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. × sinensis</italic> did not show great variation in their repellent effects at the evaluated concentrations during the 24 h of the test. These oils had the highest repellent effects against 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic>, being classified in categories IV and V. For citronellal, α-pinene, linalool, limonene and β-caryophyllene has been reported in literature their repellent action against 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic>, and these were the majority constituents in some of these EOs [

 <italic>C. citratus</italic> exhibited the greatest repellent effect at 24 h, classifying in category V for the highest concentrations evaluated. Some of these oils were characterized by a high content of 1,8-cineole, limonene, and α-pinene, compounds for which their repellent activity against
