<p>In the case of the EOs of 
 <italic>S. viminea</italic>, 
 <italic>Ocotea</italic> sp. and 
 <italic>P. el-metanum</italic>, a 50% decrease in toxicity with respect to the preliminary insecticide assay was observed, suggesting that these EOs may have had fumigant and contact effects on the insects. Analyzing the chemical composition of these three EOs, it could be observed that they were composed, more than 90%, of monoterpenes. The first one was characterized by a high content of p-ment-3-en-8-ol (45.4%) and pulegone (38.6%), the second one mainly contained α-terpineol (44.2%), and the last one had α-phellandrene (43.5%) as the major component. The fumigant and contact activities for pulegone and fumigant activity for α-terpineol and α-phellandrene have been reported in the literature concerning 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic>. [
 <xref rid="B14-insects-12-00532" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. 
 <italic>M. septentrionalis</italic> was also characterized by high contents of pulegone (41.9%). For this oil, there was no reduction in mortality in the fumigant assay, suggesting that the decrease in the toxic effects of 
 <italic>S. viminea</italic> may have been related to the presence of p-ment-3-en-8-ol, a compound that possibly exerted a contact effect.
