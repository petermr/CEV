<p>Like the oil of

 <italic>R. officinalis</italic>,

 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> sp., 
 <italic>C. × sinensis</italic> and 
 <italic>L. alba</italic> exhibited similar activity in the two methods evaluated, indicating that their toxic effects against 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic> were fumigant. In these oils, a high content of monoterpenes was observed, except for 
 <italic>H. mexicanum</italic> oil, which was mainly composed of alkanes (nonane, 53.1%). The oils mentioned above had in common the presence of limonene, α-pinene, and 1,8-cineole, compounds for which fumigant activity against 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic> had been previously reported [
