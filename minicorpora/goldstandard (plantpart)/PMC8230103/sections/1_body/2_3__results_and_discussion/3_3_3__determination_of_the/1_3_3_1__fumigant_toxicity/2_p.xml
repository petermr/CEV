<p>When comparing the results of the two methodologies used, it was evident that by avoiding contact between insects and EO, 10 of the 24 EOs showed a decrease in their toxic effects, reaching mortality rates equal to or less than 10%. For these 10 EOs, fumigant toxicity was negligible compared to contact toxicity at the tested concentrations. Among the species that lost their toxic effects avoiding the contact were mainly those belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Piper.</italic> Considering the chemical composition of the 10 oils that proved not to be fumigants, it was observed that they contained phenylpropanoids (
 <italic>I. verum</italic>, 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic>, 
 <italic>P. nubigenium</italic>, and 
 <italic>P.</italic> cf. 
 <italic>asperiusculum</italic>) or sesquiterpenes (
 <italic>A. cumanensis</italic>) as major compounds. This could lead to thinking that these types of metabolites tend to affect insects mainly by contact, probably due to their low volatility [
