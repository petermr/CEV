<p>To select a method for evaluating any insecticidal effect, it is important to consider whether the test conditions are adequate for the characteristics of the insects, especially in the case of the fumigant effect. Given the ability of 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic> to climb the walls of the vial and come into contact with the paper impregnated with the treatment, it was possible that the mortality of the insects was due to both contact toxicity and/or the fumigant effect. Hence, the need of differentiating between an exclusively fumigant test and a general test of insecticidal activity was evident. To determine which of the 24 EOs exerted a purely fumigant action, a test that avoided contact of the insect with the oil, was carried out. A comparison of the results of the mortality in the preliminary insecticidal assays and of the fumigant test is presented in
