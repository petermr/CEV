<p>The results of the contact and fumigant toxicities of the 14 EOs that presented mortality rates greater than 25% in the fumigant test are illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00532-f006">Figure 6</xref>. It was observed that 13 EOs exhibited fumigant and contact activities, while 
 <italic>H. mexicanum</italic> EO was the only one that did not cause contact mortality. The EOs from 
 <italic>C. × sinensis</italic>, 
 <italic>C. sempervirens</italic> and 
 <italic>H. myricariifolium</italic>, although they were toxic by contact in all the quantities evaluated, caused higher mortalities when they were evaluated as fumigants at a concentration of 500 µL/L of air. In contrast, the oils from 
 <italic>S. viminea</italic>, 
 <italic>M. septentrionalis</italic>, 
 <italic>Ocotea</italic> sp., and 
 <italic>C. album</italic>, although they exhibit fumigant activity at the concentrations evaluated, caused higher mortality rates when the oils were applied directly to the insect at all the quantities tested.
