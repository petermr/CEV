<p>The fumigant test carried out against 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic> suggested that 10 of the 24 EOs could present, mainly, a contact effect because their lethal effects in the fumigant assays were less than 10%. The results of these oils in the topical contact toxicity test are illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00532-f005">Figure 5</xref>; here, it can be seen that these 10 EOs caused mortality in ranges from 30 to 100%, confirming the observed behavior in the fumigant tests. Similarly, it was found that the oils of 
 <italic>P. aduncum</italic>, 
 <italic>L. origanoides</italic>, 
 <italic>C. nardus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> were the most active by contact, causing mortality greater than 90% in the three quantities evaluated. For the remaining six EOs, it was shown that the percentage of mortality increased proportionally with the amount of oil applied.
