<p>In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00532-f006">Figure 6</xref>, the contact toxicity results for the 10 AEs that did not cause high fumigant effects are presented. It is observed that the AEs corresponding to 
 <italic>S. viminea</italic>, 
 <italic>M. septentrionalis</italic>, 
 <italic>Ocotea</italic> sp. and 
 <italic>L. alba</italic> were the most active in the topical contact test, causing mortality rates higher than 90% in all the quantities evaluated. These results indicate that EOs consisting mainly of phenylpropanoids and sesquiterpenes exerted an action mainly by contact against 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic>. It has been described in structure-activity relationship studies that less volatile compounds tend to present a higher toxicity by contact [
 <xref rid="B39-insects-12-00532" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In contrast, for monoterpenes, there was no clear trend because they could exert a toxic effect by fumigation, contact or both.
