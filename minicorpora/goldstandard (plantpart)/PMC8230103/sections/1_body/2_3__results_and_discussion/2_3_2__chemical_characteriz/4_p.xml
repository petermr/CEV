<p>This work constitutes the first report of the chemical composition of EOs from leaves of 
 <italic>M. septentrionalis</italic> and 
 <italic>P. nubigenum</italic>. For the EO of the species 
 <italic>M. septentrionalis</italic>, 93.78% of the chemical composition was determined, finding that this oil was characterized by containing monoterpenic ketones (menthone (8.17%) and pulegone (41.85%)) and sesquiterpenoids (Î²-caryophyllene (16.51%) and bicyclogermacrene (8.67%)). This class of compounds has been previously reported in other species of the genus 
 <italic>Minthostachys</italic> and in the family Lamiaceae [

 <italic>P. nubigenum,</italic> 93.30% of the chemical composition was determined and its main components were myristicin (36.68%) and apiol (11.83%), compounds that are characteristic of some species of the genus 
 <italic>Piper</italic> [
