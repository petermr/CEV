<p>The GC–MS analysis with orthogonal polarity columns of the 24 EOs allowed the identification of 166 compounds, corresponding to 83–99% of the total composition. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00532-f003">Figure 3</xref>, percentage contents of the main chemical classes of the essential oil components are reported. In 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-insects-12-00532">Table S2</xref>, the compounds are presented according to the elution order obtained with the DB-5MS column; the retention index for both columns (DB-5MS and HP-INNOWax), the refractive index, and the density for each of the EOs are also reported.
