 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00532-f003">Figure 3</xref>, the chemical composition of the EOs was varied, highlighting monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, phenylpropanoids and other compounds. It was determined that from the 24 EOs selected, 75.0% of those were mainly monoterpenic (56.3% and 99.7% of the total chemical composition). Among the major monoterpenes, the presence of α-pinene, β-pinene, 1,8-cineole, limonene, carvone, camphor, and pulegone stood out, compounds for which previously were reported fumigant, repellent, and/or antifeeding activity against
