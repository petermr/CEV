<p>In this study, for the Piperaceae family, EOs were found consisting mainly of monoterpenes and/or sesquiterpenes, which was in accordance with what had been reported in the literature for 
 <italic>P. pertomentellum</italic> (cis-β-ocimene (28.49%), trans-β-ocimene (21.02%), and germacrene D (26.88%)) and 
 <italic>P. aduncum</italic> (α-pinene (6.14%), limonene (6.59%), linalool (22.43%), and piperitone (45.46%)), among others [
 <xref rid="B37-insects-12-00532" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. For the EO of P. 
 <italic>el-methanum</italic> (synonymous 
 <italic>P. oblicum</italic>), it was determined that the main constituents were α-pinene (8.48%), α-phellandrene (43.47%), limonene (19.36%), and β-phellandrene (7.78%). When comparing the chemical composition with that previously reported for the EO of 
 <italic>P. oblicum</italic>, great differences were found, which may be related to the origin of the species. [
 <xref rid="B38-insects-12-00532" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Additionally, it was found species characterized by their high contents of phenylpropanoid type molecules, among which stand out 
 <italic>P. nubigenum</italic> and 
 <italic>P.</italic> cf. 
 <italic>asperiusculum</italic>.
