<p>An exploratory cluster analysis was carried out with the Euclidean distance model as a selection criterion to define the representative sample of EOs that have insecticidal potential, mainly fumigant. In this analysis, the initial sample corresponded to the 24 AOs that presented insecticidal effects in the general test. The results obtained for these EOs on a time scale of 24 h at the maximum concentration or dose in three treatments were included as variables: T1 (fumigant action), T2 (contact toxicity) and T3 (repellency). The cluster analysis allowed determining two main groups, according to their insecticidal activity. The first group consist of 14 EOs (
 <italic>X. discreta, C. sempervirens, H. mexicanum, H. myricariifolium, R. officinalis, L stoechas, M. septentrionalis, Eucalyptus</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Ocotea</italic> sp., 
 <italic>C. × sinensis, L. alba, S. viminea, C. album</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. el-metanum</italic>) that showed greater fumigant action (mortalities greater than 50% with 500 µL/L air). The second group is mainly constituted by the EOs that presented the highest contact and repellent potential, except for 
 <italic>P. aduncum</italic> oil that presented high contact activity and low repellent effect (33%). The EOs belonging to the second group were discarded for causing mortalities, in the fumigant method, that did not exceed 10%. It was found that in the group of 14 EOs, 75% had a percentage of mortality and repellency above 85% (
