<p>To verify the section of the final sample, a Box-Plot diagram was constructed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00532-f007">Figure 7</xref>), in which the %mortality caused in the fumigant method is represented for the EOs that make up group I (selected EOs) and the group II (EOs discarded), observing marked differences between the two groups. In group I it is observed that approximately 25% of the EAs that comprise it can cause mortalities greater than 40% with a concentration of 500 ÂµL/L air, and that approximately 50% of the EAs can cause mortalities greater than 70% at the same concentration. On the contrary, in group II it is found that the oils of this group cause mortalities of less than 10%.
