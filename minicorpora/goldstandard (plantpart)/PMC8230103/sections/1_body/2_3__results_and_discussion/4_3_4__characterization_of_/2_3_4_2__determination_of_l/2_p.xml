<p>The lethal concentrations, LC
 <sub>30</sub> and LC
 <sub>90</sub>, were estimated to make a scatter plot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00532-f008">Figure 8</xref>) that allowed easier visualization of the sensitivity that 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic> had to different lethal concentrations of each EO. In this sense, it was observed that for the oils of 
 <italic>L. alba</italic> and 
 <italic>L. stoechas</italic>, the smallest changes in the concentration of the oils were required to achieve significant changes in insect mortality. In contrast, for the oils of 
 <italic>H. myricariifolium</italic> and 
 <italic>P. el-metanum</italic>, high variations in their concentrations were required to achieve an appreciable change in the mortality of 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic>, with LC
 <sub>90</sub> above 1000 Î¼L/L of air. Additionally, it was observed that although the EO of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> sp. had the lowest values of LC
 <sub>30</sub> and LC
 <sub>50</sub>, it required a concentration of more than double the LC
 <sub>50</sub> to reach a mortality of 90%. In this study, the fumigant LC
 <sub>50</sub> values on 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic> are reported for the first time for the oils of 
 <italic>L. stoechas, R. officinalis, M. septentrionalis, X. discreta, C. sempervirens, S. viminea, C. album</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. el-mentanum</italic>.
