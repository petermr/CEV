 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> sp., 
 <italic>H. mexicanum</italic>, 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> and 
 <italic>L. alba</italic>, with concentrations lower than 255.0 μL/L air. The other essential oils evaluated presented LC
 <sub>50</sub> between 300.0 and 650.0 μL/L air. The oil of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> sp. was the most toxic because it presented the lowest median lethal concentration (LC
 <sub>50</sub>: 184.3 μL/L of air), being significantly lower than the other essential oils based on the criterion of nonoverlapping of the LC
 <sub>50</sub> confidence intervals at 95% probability. The highest LC
 <sub>50</sub> was observed for 
 <italic>Ocotea</italic> sp. oil (LC
 <sub>50</sub>: 642.63 μL/L of air), which was 38.68 times higher than the LC
 <sub>50</sub> estimated for 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> sp., being the least toxic EO by fumigance.
