 <xref rid="insects-12-00532-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> reports the LC
 <sub>50</sub> for the 17 active ICs, as well as the slope values and significance of each of the equations that represent the regressions applied to the selected compounds using a Probit analysis. All active compounds had LC
 <sub>50</sub> lower than 120 mg/L air; among them, the monoterpenic ketones R-(+)-pulegone, S-(-)-pulegone, and R-(-)-carvone stood out because they exhibited lower LC
 <sub>50</sub> than dichlorvos (positive control). Additionally, they were the compounds with greater slopes, indicating that small changes in concentration were required to increase mortality against 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic>. Other compounds with moderate fumigant effect like (-)-terpinen-4-ol, S-(+)-carvone, R-(-)-fenchone, terpinolene, and 1,8-cineole also did not require large changes in concentration to increase their fumigant capacity. Fumigant activity against species of the genus 
 <italic>Sitophilus</italic> has been previously reported in the literature for these compounds, with LC
 <sub>50</sub> between 19.0 and 30.6 Î¼L/L air [

 <sub>50</sub> against 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic> for S-(-)-pulegone and R-(-)-fenchone are reported for the first time.
