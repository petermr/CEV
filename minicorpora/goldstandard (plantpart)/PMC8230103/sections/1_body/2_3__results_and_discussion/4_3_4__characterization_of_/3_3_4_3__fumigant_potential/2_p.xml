<p>Among the 19 ICs evaluated, 17 presented fumigant potential, causing mortalities higher than 70% at a concentration of 150 mg/L. The compounds 1,8-cineole, sabinene, α-pinene and limonene presented high fumigant activity (mortality &gt; 80%) and were present as major components in more than three active EOs. Other constituents that were found as the majority in at least two EOs with high fumigant activity were β-pinene, R-(+)-pulegone, and S-(-)-pulegone, which presented a mortality of 100% at maximum concentration evaluated. Compounds that were presented on at least one potentially fumigant EO such as α-phellandrene, γ-terpinene, R-(-) fenchone, ∆-3-carene, terpinolene, and carvone (R and S) also showed stronger fumigant action. The compounds that were present in more than one EO, but in a low proportion, such as 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, α-terpinene, and (-)-terpinen-4-ol, revealed a mortality of 100%. This indicated that the fumigant capacity of the EOs was not only due to their majority components.
