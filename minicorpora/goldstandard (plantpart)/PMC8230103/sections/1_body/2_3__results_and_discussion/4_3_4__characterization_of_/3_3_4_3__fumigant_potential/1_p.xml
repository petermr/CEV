<p>To estimate which of the chemical constituents of EOs may be responsible for the fumigant effects against 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic>, the Wald statistical method was applied (with a significance level of 1%). This analysis did not allow discrimination between the possible compounds responsible for the fumigant effect, as it suggested that the 166 chemical constituents determined in this study are highly significant in the fumigant toxicity. It is important to mention that Wald’s method does not consider interactions of any kind due to multicollinearity problems in the data [
 <xref rid="B50-insects-12-00532" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Therefore, in this study, 19 major ICs present in the EOs with the highest fumigant potential (LC50 &lt; 255 μL/L air) (
