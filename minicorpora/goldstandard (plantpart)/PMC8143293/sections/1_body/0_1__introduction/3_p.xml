<p>The 
 <italic>Aloysia citrodora</italic> plant contains neral, 1,8-cineole, geraniol, limonene, tannin, phenolic acids, flavonoids, and alkaloids [
 <xref rid="B14-metabolites-11-00256" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Many studies have been conducted on the phytochemicals and antioxidant properties of the 
 <italic>Aloysia citrodora</italic> plant [
 <xref rid="B15-metabolites-11-00256" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], which have confirmed its antioxidant properties [
 <xref rid="B16-metabolites-11-00256" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In addition, the protection effect of the 
 <italic>Aloysia citrodora</italic> plant has been proven [

Post-harvest damages of strawberry fruits, at cold storage, including fungal pathogens, water and biochemical loss, and softening resulted in a low shelf life of the strawberries (approximately 5 days). Therefore, the aim of the present work was to extend the shelf life of strawberries by using non-chemical post-harvest treatment. Particularly, the impacts of different levels of 
 <italic>A. citrodora</italic> EOs throughout post-harvest cold storage on enzymatic activities, antioxidant capacity, and biochemical constituents in strawberries were assessed. The obtained results can provide natural and Gras resources for the food industry and post-harvest technology.
