<p>The applications of artificial antimicrobials for increasing the fruit’s shelf life are linked to toxicity effects, which has led to the search for healthier options. Therefore, the recent use of natural sources in fruits to control quality properties is known as one of the more efficient techniques [

 <xref rid="B5-metabolites-11-00256" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In this regard, the application of essential oils (EOs) could lead to delaying fruit spoilage, maintaining the quality, and increasing the shelf life [
 <xref rid="B6-metabolites-11-00256" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. EOs have potential antifungal properties and are used as disinfectants, which would allow them to reduce early fruit deterioration and increase the fruit’s post-harvest life [
