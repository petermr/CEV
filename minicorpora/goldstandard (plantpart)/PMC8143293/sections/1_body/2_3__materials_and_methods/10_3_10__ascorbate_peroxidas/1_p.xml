For the measurement of enzyme activity: 300 μL of sodium phosphate buffer (pH = 7, containing 0.2 EDTA mM), 200 μL of ascorbic acid (0.5 mM), 200 μL of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), 50 μL of enzyme extract, and 50 μL of hydrogen peroxide (250 mM) were mixed. Absorption changes were measured by spectrophotometry at 290 nm for 3 min. The enzyme activity was calculated using the extinction coefficient of ascorbic acid (mM
 <sup>−1</sup> cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) according to unit/mg protein of the sample.
