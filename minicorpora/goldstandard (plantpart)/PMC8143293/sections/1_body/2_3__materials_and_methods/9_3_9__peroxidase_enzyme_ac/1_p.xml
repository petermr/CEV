<p>Peroxidase enzyme activity of the samples was evaluated according to Mohammadi et al. [
 <xref rid="B58-metabolites-11-00256" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Briefly, 2 mL of tris buffer (100 μM, pH = 7.5), 300 μL of oxygen peroxide of 5 μm, and 200 μL guaiacol (10 μM) were mixed in an ice bath. Then, 50 μL of enzyme extracts was added. The curve of absorption changes was assessed by spectrophotometry at 425 nm. The peroxidase enzyme activity was expressed as u/mg protein of the sample.
