<p>The pH difference method was used to measure the total anthocyanin content. For this purpose, the fruit juice was centrifuged at 11,000× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4 °C, and then, 100 µL of a supernatant was used. Two buffers were prepared with pH 1 and 4. Then, 2.5 mL of buffer 1 was poured into the test tube. Afterward, 100 μL of the extract was added to the solution poured into the test tube, and the absorbance at two wavelengths of 700 nm and 530 nm was read. Next, 2.5 mL of buffer 2 (pH 4.5) was poured into another test tube and 100 μL of the extract was added, and the absorbance at two wavelengths of 700 nm and 530 nm was read. Finally, the following formula was used to be calculated the total absorbance of each of the extracts [
