<p>TPC was determined using Folin–Ciocalteu reagent according to the method of Ali-rezalu et al. [
 <xref rid="B4-metabolites-11-00256" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A total of 30 μL concentrated extract was poured into the test tube, and 90 μL distilled water was added. Then, 600 μL of 10% Folin was added, and after 10 min, 480 μL of 7.5% sodium carbonate was added, and after placing it for 30 min in the dark at room temperature, a spectrophotometer (UV-1800, Shimatzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) was used to read the absorbance at 760 nm. Gallic acid was used as a standard. The total phenol content of extracts was expressed as mg of gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g FW of the sample.
