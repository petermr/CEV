<p>Total acidity was calculated by the titration method using sodium hydroxide (0.1 N) in terms of citric acid. In other words, it was titrated with soda solution (0.1 N) to reach pH 8.3. After applying, the value of the used soda was introduced in the following formula, and the acidity was calculated based on g of citric acid in 2 L of fruit extract and then converted to a percent [
