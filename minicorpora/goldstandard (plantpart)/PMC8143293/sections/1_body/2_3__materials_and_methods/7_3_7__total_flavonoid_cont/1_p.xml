<p>To measure the total flavonoid content, 500 µL of the prepared extract was poured into the test tube, and 150 µL of 5% sodium nitrite was added. After 5 min, 300 µL of 10% aluminum chloride was added, and again, after 5–10 min, 1000 µL of 1% NaOH was mixed into the resulting solution and was brought to a volume of 5 mL with the deionized water. The absorbance of the resulting mixture was read at 380 nm, compared to the control. Quercetin was used to draw the standard curve. The total flavonoid content of the total extracts was expressed as mg of quercetin equivalent (Qu)/100 g FW of the sample [
