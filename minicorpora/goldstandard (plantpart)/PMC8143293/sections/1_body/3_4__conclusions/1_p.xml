<p>The aim of the present work was to extend the shelf life of strawberries by using non-chemical post-harvest treatment. Treated strawberries with 
 <italic>Aloysia citrodora</italic> EOs had less weight loss and higher biochemical contents, antioxidant properties, and enzyme activity compared to control. According to obtained results, the 
 <italic>Aloysia citrodora</italic> EOs (particularly 500â€“750 ppm) could potentially improve shelf life, safety, and biochemical components retention by decreasing the decay rate in strawberries in cold storage. The outcomes of the present work provide new safe and Gras additives to the production of new products for the post-harvest and food industries, but further research is needed to obtain more details on 
 <italic>Aloysia citrodora</italic> EOs.
