<p>The results of total flavonoid content are displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00256-f004">Figure 4</xref>b. The results indicated that samples treated with 750 ppm ACEOs had significantly higher TFC compared to other groups. Previous results may be attributed to the fact that plant extracts or EOs are a rich source of phenolic and flavonoid compounds. In this way, higher amounts of flavonoids (as potential antioxidant ingredients) in treated samples could increase the shelf life of strawberries, compared to the control.
