<p>Fruit samples treated with 250 and 500 ppm ACEOs displayed the highest amounts of total phenolic compounds (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00256-f004">Figure 4</xref>a). In contrast, higher TPC of treated samples with 500 ppm ACEOs as compared to 750 ppm ACEOs at days 14 and 21 might be attributed to the toxic impacts of higher EO levels on the cells, resulting in breakdown of the cellular structure, which could be related to aging and the enhanced activity of the polyphenol oxidase enzyme [

 <xref rid="B39-metabolites-11-00256" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The higher amounts of phenolic compounds in plant sources might be the main reason for the higher total phenolic compounds in treated samples with ACEOs compared to the control. As expected, samples treated with 750 ppm ACEOs had the highest phenol levels. Phenolic compounds in plant materials are highly susceptible to environmental and biological stresses [

 <xref rid="B41-metabolites-11-00256" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The results of this work indicated that treated samples with higher concentrations of ACEOs displayed higher amounts of TPC, which paralleled results reported by Yang et al. [
