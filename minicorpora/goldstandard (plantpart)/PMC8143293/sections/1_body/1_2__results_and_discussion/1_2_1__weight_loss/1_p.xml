<p>The weight loss and water loss of fruit samples were both decreased throughout the keeping period, which may have been caused by evaporation. Based on obtained results, the samples treated with ACEOs showed a lower weight loss compared to the control. The samples treated with 750 ppm ACEOs displayed the lowest percentage of weight loss compared to other treatments during the storage period (
