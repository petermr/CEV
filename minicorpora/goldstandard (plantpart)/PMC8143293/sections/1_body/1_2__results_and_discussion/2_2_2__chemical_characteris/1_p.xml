<p>The results indicated that the TSS of control samples was lower than that of treated samples. Treated samples with 750 ppm ACEOs had the highest dissolved solids content (

The amount of total carbohydrates was one of the most important factors in increasing the texture resistance of the fruit to stress, since conversion of starch into reducing sugars is a positive factor during stress. In addition, the fact that most organic acids are secondary metabolites that are formed as a result of a citric acid cycle, and are used during respiration because acidity increases with raising storage duration, confirms the results of the present study [
