<p>Based on the obtained results, the control and treated samples with 750 ppm ACEOs displayed the highest and lowest amount of TA, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00256-f002">Figure 2</xref>b). The results revealed that the acid levels decreased in strawberry samples during the keeping period (particularly in low-temperature rooms), which may be attributed to acids breaking down into sugar throughout fruit respiration. On the other hand, enzymatic activities in fruit juice during the keeping period could be another reason for acidity reduction [

 <sub>2</sub> at higher amounts; therefore, EOs decreased the consumption of organic acids by reduction in respiration and production of ethylene [
