<p>The organic acids accumulation during the fruit ripening process played an important role in the carboxylic acid glycolysis cycle. The fluctuation in organic acids led to changes in acidity; however, increasing in one parameter led to decreasing in other one. Therefore, acidity in orange fruits was affected by various types of acids such as citric acid, malic acid, benzoic acid, tartaric acid, and oxalic acid [

However, most of the organic acids were secondary metabolites of the citric acid cycle during fruit breathing; therefore, acidity increased throughout the storage period. These results are paralleled with previous results reported by Burdurlu et al. [
