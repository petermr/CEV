<p>There is limited research on the organoleptic attributes of treated fruits with EOs. Neri et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-metabolites-11-00256" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] showed that added (E)-hex-2-enal in nectarine and peach fruits as “green” (leafy) resulted in off-odors. However, off-odors declined throughout ripening, and nothing was perceived after ripening. In contrast, applied carvacrol or citral had no bad effects on the odor of nectarine and peach fruits. According to results reported by Aloui et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-metabolites-11-00256" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], there were no off-odors or off-flavors in dates treated with citrus EOs. Serrano et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-metabolites-11-00256" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] also evaluated the effects of thymol and eugenol on cherries and reported no organoleptic effects. Prasad and Stadelbacher [
 <xref rid="B30-metabolites-11-00256" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] indicated that acetaldehyde in low concentration (1%) did not reveal any off-flavor in strawberries, while a higher concentration of acetaldehyde (4%) resulted in off-flavor.
