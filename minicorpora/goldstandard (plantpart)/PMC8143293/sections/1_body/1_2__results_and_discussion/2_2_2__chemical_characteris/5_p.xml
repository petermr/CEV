<p>According to reviewed articles, a wide range EOs do not leave bad effects on intact fruit odors and flavors at low levels, particularly when stored fruits finish their ripening process. However, there is variation among cultivars and fruit species, and each commodity has to be tested separately. For instance, Neri et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-metabolites-11-00256" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] indicated that pome fruits were less sensitive against (E)-hex-2-enal injury compared to stone fruits, which may be attributed to higher absorption of (E)-hex-2-enal by pome fruits.
