<p>The results of the peroxidase enzyme activity of strawberries are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00256-f005">Figure 5</xref>a. The results indicated that treated strawberries with 500 ppm ACEOs had the highest levels of peroxidase enzyme activity. Peroxidases play a vital role in metabolic steps of the cell, such as auxin catabolism, lignin synthesis, and suberin [
