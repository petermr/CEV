<p>The results of the total anthocyanin content are illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00256-f004">Figure 4</xref>c. The color of the strawberry fruit is derived from anthocyanin content. In this regard, da Silva et al. [
 <xref rid="B47-metabolites-11-00256" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] found that more than 25 anthocyanins have been reported in different cultivars of strawberries, with pelargonidin 3-O-glucoside, pelargonidin 3-O-rutinoside, and cyanidin 3-O-glucoside being the main components. TAC of all samples decreased gradually during storage, which may be caused by oxidation reactions.
