<p>The outcomes of DPPH values indicated that antioxidant capacity of the samples was at its highest content at the end of the keeping time. The antioxidant properties of the samples displayed that 250 ppm AFEOs had the highest antioxidant activity compared to other treatments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00256-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The results indicated that the use of 
 <italic>A. citrodora</italic> EOs in edible coatings, by decreasing the rates of oxidation reactions, could reduce the damage of reactive oxygen species. However, by increasing the concentration of EOs, the antioxidant activities of coating increased. Antioxidant activity was increased throughout keeping time in all samples, and the rate of this activity was higher in treated samples compared to the control. The antioxidant activities of fruit samples are potentially related to the content of flavonoids and phenols, which are presented highly in plant extracts and EOs [

 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> extract on apples. The authors demonstrated that the antioxidant capacity of the samples was effectively increased throughout the keeping period. According to results reported by Sellamuthu et al. [
