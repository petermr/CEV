<p>The results of the ascorbate peroxidase enzyme activity of strawberries are illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00256-f005">Figure 5</xref>b. The results showed that the highest level of peroxidase enzyme was observed in strawberries treated with 500 ppm ACEOs. Ascorbate peroxidase enzymes activity could prevent plants from being damaged by activated oxygen species when exposed to severe stress. Afshar Mohammadian et al. [
 <xref rid="B50-metabolites-11-00256" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] proved that the cold resistance of two olive cultivars could be related to the total protein content, which was higher in sensitive olive cultivars. In addition, during cold stress the defensive enzymes activity against oxidative stress was increased; while after the cold stress, the protein storage of the plant increased to return to the normal state [
