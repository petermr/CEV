<p>Functional annotation of the 95,579 unigenes was carried out using five public protein databases. In total, 54,084 (56.58%) unigenes had a match in the Nr database, 32,399 (33.89%) in the swissprot protein database, 26,218 (27.43%) in the KOG database, and 46,665 (23.82%) in the KEGG database (

For GO annotation, 64,497 unigenes (67.48%) were classified into 53 categories, in three parts: biological process (23,331), cellular component (21,172) and molecular function (19,994). In the “biological processes” category, the transcripts were enriched with the terms “metabolic” (18,732 unigenes), “cellular” (18,680 unigenes) and “single-organism” (15,645 unigenes). In the “cellular component” category, the assignments were mostly enriched with the terms “cell” (17,137), “cell part” (17,064) and “organelle” (14,479). In the “molecular function” category, “catalytic activity” (15,129), “binding” (12,910) and “transporter activity” were the most significantly enriched terms (
