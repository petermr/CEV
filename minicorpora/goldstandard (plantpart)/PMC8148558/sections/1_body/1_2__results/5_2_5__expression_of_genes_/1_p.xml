<p>The gene families of photoreceptors, such as phytochromes, cryptochromes, phototropins, and UVR8, were identified within the DEGs. The expression levels of PHYB (Unigene0004374) and PHOT2 (unigene0003571) were dramatically reduced in darkness and increased slightly when they re-entered light. The CRY gene (Unigene0004413) showed the opposite expression pattern: upregulated under darkness and downregulated after removing the covers. Other photoreceptorsâ€™ transcription expressions were changed similarly to those of the PHOTs, and these changes were not significant.</p>
