<p>COP1, a ring-finger type ubiquitin E3 ligase, functions as a repressor of photomorphogenesis, and was significantly downregulated in darkness and upregulated when returning to light. HY5 and PIFs are the downstream components of photoreceptor-mediated light signaling. Both of the two HY5 potential homologs, and three potential homologs, were identified. HY5 was significantly downregulated under darkness and upregulated after removing the covers. PIFs are the key regulators in shade-avoidance responses. The transcript levels of PIF1 and PIF4 were dramatically upregulated following the 24 h darkness treatment, while PIF3 was not differentially expressed after the treatment (
