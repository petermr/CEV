<p>From the transcriptome analysis, 14 DEGs involved in the monoterpenoids biosynthetic pathway were identified. These were terpene synthases (TPSs), (âˆ’)-isopiperitenone reductases (IPR), menthol dehydrogenases (MR), cytochrome P450 (P450), neomenthol dehydrogenases (NMRs) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). The two TPSs were alpha-pinene/camphene synthase and linalool synthase. We identified 15 DEGs involved in sesquiterpenoids and triterpenoids. Excepted for the Unigene0029907 identified as (3S)-linalool synthase, the other 14 TPSs were dramatically downregulated in the dark but were then upregulated to the same expression level after regaining access to light for 24 h (
