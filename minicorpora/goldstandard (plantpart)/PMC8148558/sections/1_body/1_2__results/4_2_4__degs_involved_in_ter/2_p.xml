<p>In mint, menthol was the most prevalent chemical compound among the monoterpenoids. In our study, orthologous genes encoding enzymes that catalyzed the biosynthesis of (−)-menthol were identified by multiple sequence alignment, using the reference genes of peppermint and spearmint. The nucleotides of these genes were cloned and sequenced in

The expression profiles of six identified genes, including limonene synthase (LS), (−)-limonene-3-hydroxylase (L3OH), isopiperitenol dehydrogenase (iPR), isopiperitenone reductase (iPD), pulegone reductase (PR), and neomenthol dehydrogenase (MNR), showed the same patterns: they were significantly downregulated under 24 h of darkness and upregulated after returning to the light for 24 h (

Only the MFS gene showed the opposite expression pattern, which was upregulation under darkness and downregulation after removing the covers. Although the GPPS-l, GPPS-s, and MR genes’ expression levels were not dramatically altered by light exposure, they were all downregulated as a result of darkness (
