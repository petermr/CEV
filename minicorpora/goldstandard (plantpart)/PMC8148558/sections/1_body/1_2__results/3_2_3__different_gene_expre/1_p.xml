<p>The expression profiles of 
 <italic>Mentha</italic>
 <italic>canadensis</italic> grown in darkness and light for 24 h each were analyzed separately and were selected based on two criteria: FDR &lt; 0.05 and|log2FC| &gt; 1. Compared to the samples under the control conditions, a total of 10,977 DEGs, including 6296 upregulated and 4681 downregulated genes, were differentially expressed after the 24 h darkness treatment. In total, we counted 8645 DEGs, including 3745 upregulated and 4900 downregulated genes compared to under darkness, after 24 h of light exposure (

Based on the GO enrichment, “metabolic process” and “cellular process”, as well as “single-organism process”, were the three most highly represented terms in the “biological process” category. In the “cellular component” category, “cell”, “cell part” and “organelle” were the most enriched terms. In the “molecular function” category, most DEGs were enriched in the “catalytic activity”, “binding”, and “transporter activity” subcategories. The enrichment analysis showed that 1919 genes were annotated in 133 KEGG pathways. Among them, 108 genes were involved in the “metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides” pathway (
