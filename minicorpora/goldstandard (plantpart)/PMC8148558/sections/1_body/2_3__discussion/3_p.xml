<p>The light-dependent transcriptional regulation of MEP pathway genes is conserved in all plant species we investigated. Nevertheless, not much is known about the signal transduction pathways or the transcription factors that convert the environmental information into a transcriptional response [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-10-00930" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In our transcriptome analysis results, co-expression modules with terpenoid biosynthesis genes from the MEP pathway suggest that the transcription of those genes may be coregulated by the same transcription factor as response to light. In 
 <italic>A. annua</italic>, HY5, a bZIP transcription factor and a core TF in the light signaling pathway, interacts with the promoter of the monoterpene synthesis gene 
 <italic>QH6</italic> [
 <xref rid="B24-plants-10-00930" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. It has also been reported that AaHY5 acts via trichome-specific and light-induced AaGSW1 to control artemisinin formation [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-10-00930" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Evidence from 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has demonstrated that HY5 and PIFs are direct regulators of the light-modulated expression of the 
 <italic>DXS</italic> and 
 <italic>DXR</italic> genes encoding the flux-controlling enzymes of the MEP pathway [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-10-00930" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In the present transcriptome data, homologous genes of 
 <italic>HY5</italic> (Unigene0034124), 
 <italic>PIF1</italic> (Unigene0086430) and 
 <italic>PIF4</italic> (Unigene0065109) were identified in 
 <italic>M. Canadensis</italic>. The resultant RPKM values indicate that the expression levels of these TF genes were significantly changed under dark conditions. The expression pattern of 
 <italic>HY5</italic> was the same as that of the menthol synthesis genes, whereas 
 <italic>PIFs</italic> showed the opposite expression pattern (upregulated under darkness and downregulated after illumination). These results indicate that a similar regulation mechanism to that targeting the monoterpene synthesis gene (operating via the key-master integrators of light signal transduction HY5 and PIFs) may also operate in 
 <italic>M. canadensis</italic>. More evidence should be sought in future experiments.
