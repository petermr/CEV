<p>We investigated the effects of light on the densities of peltate glandular trichomes and on the chemical properties of the essential oil composition in mint leaves. High-throughput RNA-seq data were generated to screen expression profiles under the conditions of a 24 h darkness treatment and a recovery light period of 24 h. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of the light signal transduction pathway, as well as transcription factors and monoterpene biosynthetic genes, were identified, and their expression levels were compared. The results show that the expression of monoterpene biosynthesis genes is strongly downregulated by darkness, indicating their responsiveness to light. The results facilitate a further understanding of light signalingâ€™s functional regulation of monoterpenoids biosynthesis. A series of identified responsive transcription factors (TFs) could be used in metabolic engineering to effectively increase essential oil yields.</p>
