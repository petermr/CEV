<p>Identification of volatile compounds was based on the comparison of their mass spectral fragmentation patterns with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) mass-spectral library data and other published mass spectra (Adams 2001). The percentage content of compounds was calculated by the area normalization method.</p>
