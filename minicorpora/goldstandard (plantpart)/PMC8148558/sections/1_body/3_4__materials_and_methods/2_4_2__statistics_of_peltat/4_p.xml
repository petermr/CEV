<p>GC-MS analysis was performed on a gas chromatograph Trace 1300HP interfaced with a HP 5972 mass spectrometer with electron impact ionization (70 eV). The column temperature was programmed as follows: initial temperature was 50 °C, increased to 240 °C at 5 °C min-1, and isotherm at 205 °C during 10 min. Helium was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min
 <sup>−1</sup>. The split ratio was 33:1. Scan time and mass range were 0.2 s and 33–450
