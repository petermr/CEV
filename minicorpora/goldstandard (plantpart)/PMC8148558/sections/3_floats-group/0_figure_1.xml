 <caption>
  <p>Phenotypes of 
   <italic>Mentha</italic>
   <italic>canadensis</italic> after 4 weeks of growth under low light conditions. (
   <bold>A</bold>) The morphology of leaves at the same developmental stage under normal light conditions (left) and low light conditions (right). (
   <bold>B</bold>) The abaxial surface of leaves under fluorescence light. Red spots show the spontaneous fluorescence of peltate glandular trichomes. (
   <bold>C</bold>,
   <bold>D</bold>) Peltate glandular trichome densities of the abaxial surfaceâ€”five leaf zones from basal to top regions of young leaves. Bars indicate the densities of peltate glandular trichomes. Error bars represent SD. (
   <bold>E</bold>) SEM micrographs showing PGTs on the abaxial leaf surface. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Morphology of peltate glandular trichomes and non-glandular trichomes; (
   <bold>b</bold>) abaxial leaf surface under normal light condition; (
   <bold>c</bold>) abaxial leaf surface under low light growth conditions; the red triangles indicate wrinkled PGTs. The analysis of trichome densities was repeated five times.
