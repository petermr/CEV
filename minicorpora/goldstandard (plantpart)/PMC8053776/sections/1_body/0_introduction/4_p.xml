<p>In different part of the world, various species of thymus (
 <italic>T. linearis</italic>, 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic>, and 
 <italic>T. serphyllum</italic>, etc.) are known for their traditional us in the treatment of respiratory disorders such as bronchitis, asthma, pertussis, laryngitis, tonsillitis, and cough caused by common colds (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Begrow et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Alamgeer et al., 2018</xref>). The essential oil of various thyme species were reported to be active against airways disorders (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Horváth and Ács, 2015</xref>). The essential oil obtained from 
 <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> collected from different Ethiopian localities reported the presence of active ingredients such as thymol, carvacrol, p-cymene, γ-terpenene, and rosmarinic acid (

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Damtie et al., 2018</xref>). Further, terpenes, such as thymol and carvacrol, that have been found as major constituents in essential oil-containing plants have also been reported to possess bronchodilatory effects and reduce inflammation in airways disorders (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). Further, the findings reported by (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Ahmad et al., 2010</xref>) show that thymol and carvacrol have antibacterial and antifungal activities in addition to multiple other biological effects. Based on the above mentioned traditional and scientific evidences of various thymus species and their essential oils active against various airways disorders, we in this study aimed to chemically characterize, evaluate the possible tracheal relaxant effects of 
 <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> in 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> model along with antimicrobial property of 
 <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> essential oil.
