<p>Phosphodiesterase’s decreases the levels of active cAMP and cGMP by metabolizing them to inactive forms AMP and GMP. Therefore, one of the mechanisms for an agent that causes increase in the levels of tissue cAMP and GMP is considered PDE inhibition. Hence, to test TS Oil for the possible PDE inhibitory action, cAMP contents of the trachea were measured by enzyme immunoassay using the direct cAMP enzyme immunoassay kit (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Lewis, United States). For this purpose, two sets of tracheal tissues, one set was contracted with CCh alone (control) and second set was contracted with CCh followed by inhibition with increasing concentrations of TS Oil (treated). Both types of the tracheal sets were immediately removed from the organ bath and were frozen in liquid nitrogen. After grinding the tissues into fine powder, homogenization was done immediately in 0.1 M HCl (10 volumes) followed by centrifugation (600 g, 10 min) at 22°C. The supernatant was extracted from centrifuged samples and diluted with 0.1 M HCl and stored at −80°C till the time of determination of cAMP. The tissue concentration of cAMP content was expressed as pmol/mg protein.</p>
