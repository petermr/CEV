<p>After collection, the fresh aerial parts of 
 <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> were cut into small pieces and subjected to hydro-distillation (water distillation) for 3 h by using a Clevenger-type apparatus. Hydro-distillation was performed 11 times until enough amount of sample was collected. The obtained essential oil was dried using anhydrous sodium sulfate and stored in tightly closed vials at 4°C until further testing and analysis (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Asfaw et al., 2000</xref>). The calculated essential oil yield was expressed in percentage (% v/w), based on the weight of the fresh plant material. A stock solution of the obtained oil was prepared by mixing 300 uL of oil (≈300 mg) with 700 uL of distilled water containing 10% DMSO to obtain a stock concentration of 300 mg/ml. The formula, “density = mass/volume (d = m/v),” was used while calculating the mass of 
 <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> oil where the density of oil was found equal to one. Further dilutions were prepared from this stock solution (300 mg/ml) where the final bath concentration of DMSO obtained was &lt;1% in bronchodilatory and antimicrobial experiments.
