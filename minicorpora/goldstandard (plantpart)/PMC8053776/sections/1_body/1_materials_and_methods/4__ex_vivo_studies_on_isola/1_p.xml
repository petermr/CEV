<p>The trachea was isolated from guinea pig sacrificed by cervical dislocation and exsanguinated. Approximately, 2–3 cartilaginous rings, constituting one tracheal tissue, were opened by a longitudinal cut opposite to the smooth muscle layer. The opened tissue was then mounted in a 20 ml organ tube containing Kreb’s solution (37°C) and bubbled with carbogen. A tension equal to 1 g was constantly maintained in each of the tracheal tissues during the experiment. During the equilibration of tissue for 1 h, the Krebs solution in the bath was replaced every 15 min, while CCh (1 µM) and K
 <sup>+</sup> (80 mM) were repeatedly used to stabilize the tissue until constant contractions of each agonist were achieved. After stabilization, the relaxant effect of TS Oil was determined by adding it cumulatively every 10 min to get the concentration-dependent effects. Tracheal contraction and relaxation were recorded by using isometric transducers attached to emkaBath with IOX software (France).
