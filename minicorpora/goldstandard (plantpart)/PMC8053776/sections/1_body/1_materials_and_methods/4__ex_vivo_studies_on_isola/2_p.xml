<p>To investigate the possible effect of the plant oil to exhibit inhibitory action on Ca
 <sup>++</sup> channels, the tracheal tissues were depolarized with high K
 <sup>+</sup> (80 mM). K
 <sup>+</sup> &gt; 30 mM is known to depolarize the tissue by opening of voltage-gated Ca
 <sup>++</sup> channels and/or other transporters and channels such as; Ca-Na exchanger and TRP channels and thus, causing smooth muscle contractions (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Wray, 2010</xref>). Meanwhile, the substance inhibiting high K
 <sup>+</sup>-induced contraction might in some way leads to a reduction in the Ca
 <sup>++</sup> influx through these pathways and might be considered as a Ca
 <sup>++</sup> channel blockers (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Hussain et al., 2008</xref>). In the next step, to endorse the Ca
 <sup>++</sup> channel blockade (CCB) effect of TS Oil, the tracheal tissues stabilized in normal Kreb’s solution were immersed in Ca
 <sup>++</sup>-free Kreb’s solution containing EDTA (0.1 mM) where the tissues were incubated for 30 min to remove Ca
 <sup>++</sup> from the tissue. Thereafter, the Ca
 <sup>++</sup>-free Kreb’s solution was replaced with K
 <sup>+</sup>-rich and Ca
 <sup>++</sup>-free Kreb’s solution. After incubation of tracheal tissue for an hour in K
 <sup>+</sup>-rich and Ca
 <sup>++</sup>-free Kreb’s solution, Ca
 <sup>++</sup> induced contractions were recorded to obtained control CRCs. When the Ca
 <sup>++</sup>-CRCs were found to be superimposable, the tracheal tissues were incubated with TS Oil for 1 h. The CRCs of Ca
 <sup>++</sup> were repeated in the presence of increasing concentrations (1 and 3 mg/ml) of the TS Oil and the results were compared using verapamil (0.03 and 0.1 µM) as standard (positive control).
