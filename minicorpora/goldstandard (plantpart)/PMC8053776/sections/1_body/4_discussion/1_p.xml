<p>This study attempted to investigate the possible therapeutic uses of 
 <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> essential oil in hyperactive airways disorders and its effectiveness against related microbial infections (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Meresa et al., 2017</xref>). For this purpose, 
 <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> essential oil extracted by hydro-distillation was tested on isolated guinea-pig tracheal tissues mounted in organ bath with physiological buffer and carbogen. The antimicrobial assay was conducted on selected microbial strains, and GC-MS analysis was done to characterize the active ingredients present in the essential oil. In the preliminary 
 <italic>ex-vivo</italic> experiments, TS Oil was found active and inhibit the contractions induced by selected tracheal spasmogens such as carbachol (1 µM) and high K
 <sup>+</sup> (80 mM) (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Imam et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Rehman et al., 2020</xref>). Experiments were further extended to know the mechanism(s) involved in the observed tracheal relaxation. In this context, it has been reported earlier that medicinal plants usually produced bronchodilatory effects by anticholinergic, Ca
 <sup>++</sup> channel inhibition and/or phosphodiesterase inhibition (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Ansari et al., 2020</xref>). To elucidate the possible involvement of these mechanism(s), the pattern of the inhibitory CRCs of TS Oil in guinea-pig isolated tracheal tissues against CCh and high K
 <sup>+</sup> (80 mM) were critically analysed. It was clearly evident in the results that TS Oil selectively show more potency to inhibit carbachol as compared to high K
 <sup>+</sup>-induced contractions, hence we hypothesized that the tracheal relaxant effects of TS Oil are targeted at muscarinic receptors and Ca
 <sup>++</sup> channels. Dicyclomine, an antagonist of muscarinic receptors as well as an inhibitor of Ca
 <sup>++</sup> ion influx (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Downie et al., 1977</xref>), exhibited a similar pattern of inhibition with lower EC50 values against CCh when compared with high K
 <sup>+</sup>. On the other hand, verapamil, a pure Ca
 <sup>++</sup> channel inhibitor (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Fleckenstein, 1977</xref>), was found more potent against the K
 <sup>+</sup>-induced contractions compared to CCh whereas, atropine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Delmendo et al., 1989</xref>), showed efficacy against CCh-induced contractions only, as expected. The observed dual effect of TS Oil, as an anticholinergic and CCB like, was reconfirmed by standard protocols suggesting the construction of the CCh and Ca
 <sup>++</sup> CRCs, respectively, in the absence and presence of pre-incubated concentrations of TS Oil in isolated trachea. In the antimuscarinic assay, the pre-incubation of the tracheal tissue with lower concentration of TS Oil resulted in a parallel shift of CCh-curves towards right without the suppression of its maximum effect, which is a distinctive feature of a competitive antagonist, such as atropine (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Arunlakhshana and Schild, 1959</xref>), whereas the next higher concentration of TS Oil produced a non-parallel displacement in CCh-curves to the right with the suppression of the maximum effect. This suppression of the maximum response suggests the presence of non-specific inhibition, similar to that observed previously and in the current study with verapamil, a Ca
 <sup>++</sup> channel blocker (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Gilani et al., 2008</xref>). When tested, dicyclomine also caused shifting of CCh-curves toward the right in a pattern similar to that of TS Oil. However, the treatment of tracheal tissues with verapamil at both, lower and higher concentrations caused a non-parallel shift of CCh-curves toward right with suppression of the maximum response. To prove our second hypothesis of possible involvement of TS Oil with Ca
 <sup>++</sup> channels, the pre-treated tracheal tissues with TS Oil produced a rightward shift of the Ca
 <sup>++</sup> curves with suppression of maximum response in a pattern similar to verapamil, which may indicate the Ca
 <sup>++</sup> inhibitory like effects of TS Oil. Although TS Oil inhibited high K
 <sup>+</sup>-mediated contractions and also shifted and inhibited the Ca
 <sup>++</sup> CRCs which indicates CCB like activity, however the production of second messengers, such as cAMP and cGMP, which, in turn, activate PKA and PKG respectively, leading to the blocking of these channels which need to be further ascertained by using a direct voltage-dependent Ca
 <sup>++</sup> channel activator, such as dihydropyridine Bay K8644 (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Allen et al., 1985</xref>).
