<p>According to (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Gilani et al., 2005</xref>), medicinal plants that exhibit tracheal relaxant effects usually show PDE inhibition and this effect usually co-exists with Ca
 <sup>++</sup> channel blocking activity. Phosphodiesterase enzymes belong to a superfamily that has a role in catalyzing the breakdown of intracellular second messenger molecules, including cAMP and cGMP; therefore, the inhibition of PDE will indirectly increase the intracellular levels of cAMP (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Beshay et al., 2001</xref>). Maintaining a high level of cAMP in airways produces a bronchodilatory effect by causing the smooth muscles of tracheal tissues to relax. To explore the possible involvement of PDE-inhibition as one of the additional mechanism(s) in the tracheal relaxation, TS Oil was tested in indirect (Isoprenaline CRCs) and direct assay (cAMP estimation). In the indirect assay, isoprenaline inhibitory CRCs were plotted against CCh-induced contractions in the absence and presence of TS Oil increasing concentrations. Interestingly, the pre-incubation of TS Oil causes a concentration-dependent potentiating effect on the isoprenaline-mediated inhibitory CRCs which is considered one of the possible indications of the tissue PDE inhibition as PDE inhibitors are known to potentiate the effect of isoprenaline (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Lorenz and Wells, 1983</xref>). A similar pattern of a leftward shift in the isoprenaline-mediated inhibitory CRCs was observed with papaverine, a known PDE inhibitor (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Lipworth, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, in the cAMP quantitative assay, TS Oil pre-incubated tissues showed an increase in the levels of cAMP in dose-dependent manner, similar to papaverine. This further strengthens the possible involvement of PDE inhibition as one of the added mechanism(s) in the tracheal relaxation of TS Oil. Notably, cAMP concentration is also increased by the beta-2 receptor stimulation present in the airways that finally causes activation of adenylate cyclase (AC) and thus causing smooth muscles relaxation (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al., 1994</xref>). The possible stimulant effect of TS Oil on beta-2 receptors might be excluded as the tracheal relaxant response was not effected in the pre-incubated tissues with propranolol, a beta receptor blocker (data not shown), however TS Oil effect on AC activation further need to be investigated. No change in the inhibitory effect was observed in the several reported studies show that anticholinergics and PDE inhibitors play an important role in the management of asthma (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Barnes, 2006</xref>), but their use is limited because they cause cardiac stimulation, a serious adverse event (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Nicholas, 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Nawarth, 1981</xref>). Itâ€™s worth mentioning that PDE enzyme type-4 (PDE-4) is selectively involved in causing the smooth muscles relaxation of the airways, therefore we recommend to establish the inhibitory role of TS Oil on PDE-4. Ca
 <sup>++</sup> channel blockers have also been reported for their usefulness in bronchoconstriction (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Twiss et al., 2002</xref>) with cardio-suppressant effect (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Billman, 1992</xref>). The presence of CCB-constituent(s) in the TS Oil with antimuscarinic and PDE inhibitory like activities is possibly meant by nature to compensate the tachycardia which is generally observed when anticholinergics or PDE inhibitors if administered alone. This type of combination of mechanism(s) supports the concept of the use of natural remedies due to their synergistic and/or side-effect neutralizing components (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Gilani et al., 2005</xref>). Further, such combinations in a single plant reduce the cost of therapy and offer advantages in evidence-based studies (
