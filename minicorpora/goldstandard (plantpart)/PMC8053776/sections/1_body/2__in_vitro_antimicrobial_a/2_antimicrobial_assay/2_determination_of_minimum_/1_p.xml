<p>MIC assays of TS Oil were performed by the broth dilution method by following standard guidelines as detailed in (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), 2016</xref>). Nine dilutions of TS Oil, ranging from 12.5to 150 μg/ml, were prepared. Selected strain of each pathogen (10 µL) was inoculated into each individual concentration of TS Oil. For testing sterility, Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB, Scharlau) was tested alone as control whereas vehicle (DMSO) effect was tested on untreated bacteria inoculated on MHB alone and with 1% DMSO as growth control. After 24 h incubation at 37 °C, the MIC of the TS Oil was calculated based on the lowest concentration of antimicrobial agent that inhibited visible growth. Minimal microbicidal concentration (MMC) in 24 h incubation was evaluated by the sub-culture of 10 µL from the broth dilution in Mueller-Hinton agar, Scharlau. All assays were run in duplicate to authenticate and statistically analyze the data.
