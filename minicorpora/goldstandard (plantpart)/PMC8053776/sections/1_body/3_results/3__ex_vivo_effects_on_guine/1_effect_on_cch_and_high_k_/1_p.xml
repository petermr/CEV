<p>In the in-vitro experiments shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, TS Oil inhibited CCh (1 µM) and K
 <sup>+</sup> (80 mM)-induced contractions. A higher potency was observed against CCh with EC50 measurement of 0.86 mg/ml (0.64–1.24, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 4) as compared to high K
 <sup>+</sup> where the obtained EC50 value was 5.24 mg/ml (4.22–6.34, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 5). A positive control drug, dicyclomine, behaved in a pattern similar to TS Oil against CCh and K
 <sup>+</sup> (80 mM) with respective EC50 values of 0.48 µM (0.38–0.52, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 4) and 5.16 µM (4.86–6.62, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 4) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). On the other hand, unlike the plant oil and dicyclomine, verapamil was found more potent against K
 <sup>+</sup>-induced contractions with an EC50 value of 0.44 µM (0.32–0.58, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 3) as compared to CCh-mediated contractions with EC50 value of 5.27 µM (4.55–6.42, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 3) as seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>. Results of atropine, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>, show only selective relaxation against CCh with EC50 measurement of 0.06 µM (0.04–0.07, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 3), while zero efficacy was observed against high K
 <sup>+</sup>.
