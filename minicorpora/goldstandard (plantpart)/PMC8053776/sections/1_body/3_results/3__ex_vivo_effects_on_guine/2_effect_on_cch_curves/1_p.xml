<p>In the anticholinergic, subtype antimuscarinic assay, in the absence of TS Oil, CRCs of CCh achieved maximum contraction (100%) with EC50 values of 0.21 µM (0.16–0.27; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 5) while TS Oil pre-incubation at 0.3 mg/ml produced a parallel shift in CCh-peaks toward right without affecting the maximal response (100%) with EC50 values of 2.27 µM (1.78–2.90; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 5), whereas the pre-incubation of trachea with next higher concentration of TS Oil (1.0 mg/ml) reduced the efficacy of CCh peaks to 73% with obtained EC50 values of 15.18 µM (11.40–21.92; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 5) as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>. Similar to TS Oil, dicyclomine (0.03 and 0.1 µM) pre-incubation, exhibited a similar pattern of shift in CCh peaks (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Meanwhile, atropine (0.03 and 0.1 µM) pre-incubation, caused a parallel shift CCh CRCs towards right without the suppression of CCh peaks at both tested concentrations (
