<p>TS Oil pretreated tracheal tissues was concentration-dependent (0.3–1.0 mg/ml) and displaced the isoprenaline-induced inhibitory CRCs toward left similar to papaverine (1.0–3.0 μM) that was used as a control drug (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A,B</xref>). In the absence of TS Oil, 100% inhibition of CCh-mediated contractions was achieved by isoprenaline with EC50 values of 0.08 µM (0.05–0.12;

 <italic>n</italic> = 5) and 0.003 µM (0.002–0.004;
