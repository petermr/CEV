<p>The MIC and MMC of TS Oil against the tested microbes was depicted in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> showed greater sensitivity to TS Oil (MIC 75 μg/ml) as compared to gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Meanwhile, MRSA (MIC 125 μg/ml) was found more resistant as compared to standard 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MIC 90 μg/ml) and other tested microbes. Moreover, no difference (p &gt; 0.05) was observed in the activity of TS Oil against clinical and standard strains of 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> (MIC 95 μg/ml).
