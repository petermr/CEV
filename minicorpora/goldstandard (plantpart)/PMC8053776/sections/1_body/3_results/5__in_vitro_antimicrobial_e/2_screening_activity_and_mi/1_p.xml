<p>The TS Oil was found most active against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> where the zone of inhibition was measured at 28 mm as compared to MRSA, which showed a zone of inhibition of 22 mm. Additionally, there was little difference (2–3 mm) between standard strains gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The vehicle (&lt;1% DMSO) was found to be inert as no zone of inhibition was observed in the wells of the cultivated plates (data not shown).
