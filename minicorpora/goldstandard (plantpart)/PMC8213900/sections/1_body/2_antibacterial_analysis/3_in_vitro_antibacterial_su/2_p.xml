<p id="p0075">The agar well diffusion technique was employed as previously described by Prabuseenivasan

 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and Otang 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] with some modifications to determine the antibacterial susceptibility test. Briefly, 100 μl of 0.5 McFarland solutions of each bacterial culture in 0.85% sterile distilled water (SDW) was aseptically dispensed on the surface of sterile agar plates and spread evenly using sterile cotton swab to make a lawn. After inoculation, four wells were made in each agar plate with a heat sterilized 6 mm cork borer. Thereafter, 50 μl of amoxicillin (0.0125 mg/ml) used as the positive control and 50 μl of the essential oil were dispensed in the first and second wells respectively. In the third and fourth wells, 50 μl of a negative control which is the nutrient broth and the carrier vehicle (10% aqueous DMSO in Tween 80) were dispensed respectively. Each test was done in triplicate. The culture plates were then incubated at 37 °C and the results were observed after 24 h. The clear zones around each well indicating the activity of the essential oil against the bacterial isolates were measured in mm.
