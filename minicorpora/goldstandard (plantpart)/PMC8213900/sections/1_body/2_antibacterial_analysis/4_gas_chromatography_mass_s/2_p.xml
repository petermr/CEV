<p id="p0080">GC-MS analyses were performed on Agilent 6890 Gas Chromatograph (GC) coupled to Agilent 5975 Mass Selective Detector (MSD) with a Zebron-5MS column (ZB-5MS 30 m × 0.25 mm x 0.25 um) (5%-phenylmethylpolysiloxane) (California, USA). The following column and temperature conditions were used: GC grade helium at a flow rate of 2 ml/min and splitless 1 ml injections was used. The injector, source and oven temperatures were set at 280 °C, 280 °C and 70 °C respectively. The ramp settings were 15 °C/min to 120 °C, then 10 °C/min to 180 °C, then 20 °C/min to 270 °C and held for 3 min.</p>
