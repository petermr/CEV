<p id="p0085">The identification of the chemical constituents of the essential oil was determined by comparing their retention times, percentage composition (area %) and retention indices with those of authentic standards and their mass spectral fragmentation patterns (Willey/ChemStation data system) [
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The identification was further confirmed by search using the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) database (NIST/EPA/NIH mass spectral library (2014) with those of published data [
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Empirical searches were conducted using The PubChem Project (
