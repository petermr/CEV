 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> ATCC 4352 and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 6538. The test organisms were obtained from the Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, University of Fort Hare, South Africa. The bacterial isolates were maintained at 4 °C on agar plates and the inoculums for the assays were prepared by diluting scraped cell mass in 0.85% sodium chloride solution, adjusted to 0.5 McFarland standards and confirmed by spectrophotometric reading at 580 nm. The cell suspensions were finally diluted 1:100 in broth to give an approximate inoculum of 10
 <sup>5</sup> cfu/ml as compared with McFarland standard used in the assays. The essential oil was prepared by being dissolved in 10% aqueous DMSO with Tween 80 (0.5% v/v for easy diffusion) before filtering through a 0.45 μm membrane filter [
