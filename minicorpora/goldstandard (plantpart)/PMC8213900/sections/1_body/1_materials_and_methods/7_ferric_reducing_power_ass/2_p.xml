 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] with slight modifications. Here, 0.5 ml (0.2 M) phosphate buffer (pH 6.6) and 0.5 ml of 0.1% potassium hexa-cyanoferrate were mixed with 0.5 ml of different concentrations of the essential oil ranging from 0.025-0.5 mg/ml before being incubate at 50 °C in a water bath for 20 min. After the incubation period, 0.5 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid was added to terminate the reaction while 0.1 ml of 0.01% FeCl
 <sub>3</sub> solution was added to 1 ml of the upper portion of the solution diluted with 1 ml of distilled water before the reaction mixture was being allowed to stand for 10 min at room temperature and the absorbance was measured at 700 nm against the appropriate blank solution. All tests were in triplicates. A higher absorbance of the reaction mixture indicated greater reducing power.
