Here, 2 ml of 10 mM of sodium nitroprusside prepared in 0.5 mM phosphate buffer saline (pH 7.4) was added to 0.5 ml of different concentrations ranging from 0.025 to 0.5 mg/ml of each of plant extracts, BHT and gallic acid separately prepared,. Each of the mixtures were incubated at 25 °C for 150 min. This was followed by adding 0.5 ml of each incubated solution to 0.5 ml of Griess reagent containing 1.0 ml sulphanilic acid reagent (0.33% prepared in 20% glacial acetic acid at room temperature for 5 min with 1 ml of naphthylenediamine dichloride (0.1% w/v)). The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min, followed by the measurement of the absorbance at 540 nm. The amount of nitric oxide radicals inhibited by the essential oil was calculated using
