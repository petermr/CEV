 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] was adopted for the determination of ABTS scavenging activity. Briefly, the stock solutions containing 7 mM ABTS solution and 2.4 mM potassium persulfate solution were prepared. The working solution was then prepared by mixing the two stock solutions in equal proportions and allowed to react for 12 h at room temperature in the dark. The solution was then diluted by mixing 1 ml ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> solution with 60 ml of methanol to obtain an absorbance of 0.708 ± 0.001 units at 734 nm using the spectrophotometer. The essential oil (1 ml) and the controls were allowed to react with 1 ml of the ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> solution and the absorbance was taken at 734 nm after 7 min with the spectrophotometer. The ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> scavenging capacity of the extract was then compared with that of the standards. The percentage inhibition was then calculated using

 </disp-formula>where A blank is the absorbance of ABTS radical + methanol used as control; A sample is the absorbance of ABTS radical + sample extract/standard. All the tests were carried out in triplicates. The activity was expressed as 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>). The lower the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value, the higher the antioxidant activity.
