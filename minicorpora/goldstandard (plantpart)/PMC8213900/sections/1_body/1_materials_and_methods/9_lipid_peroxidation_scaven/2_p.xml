<p id="p0055">An inhibition of lipid peroxidation in the rat liver homogenate was determined using a modified thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) assay described by Murugan and Parimelazhagan [
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The liver homogenate (0.5 ml, 10% in distilled water (v/v)) and 0.1 ml of essential oil were mixed separately in a test tube and the volume was made up to 1 ml by adding distilled water. Finally, 0.05 ml of FeSO
 <sub>4</sub> (0.07 M) was added to the mixture and incubated for 30 min to induce lipid peroxidation. This was followed by adding 1.5 ml of 20% acetic acid, 1.5 ml of 0.8% TBA (w/v) in 1.1% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and 0.05 ml of 20% TCA before vortexing and heating in a boiling water bath for 60 min. After cooling, 5.0 ml of butanol was added to each tube and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The absorbance of the organic upper layer was measured at 532 nm to quantify TBARS. For the blank, 1 ml of distilled water was used in place of the essential oil. Inhibition (%) of lipid peroxidation was calculated using
