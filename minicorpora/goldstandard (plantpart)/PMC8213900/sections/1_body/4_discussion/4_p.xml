<p id="p0145">Unsaturated lipids in liver tissue are very predisposed to peroxidation when exposed to reactive oxygen species (ROS) or free radicals and the most predisposed ones are the polyunsaturated fattyacids. Stark [

 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] reported that overproduction of reactive oxygen species readily attacks the polyunsaturated fatty acids in the plasma membrane leading to oxidative degradation of lipids. Birben 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] indicated that the lipid oxidation induces cellular and tissue damages through covalent bonding resulting in lipid peroxidation, DNA injury, inflammation and subsequent cell death. St. Angelo 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] and Gülçin [
 <xref rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>] report that lipid oxidation in foods and food products lowers food quality, creating off-flavors and unhealthful compounds. It, therefore, implies that increased lipid peroxidation weakens membrane function by reducing membrane fluidity and changing the activity of membrane-bound enzymes and receptor [

 <italic>E. caffra</italic> essential oil prevented lipid peroxidation activity at the lowest concentration when compared to gallic acid and BHT used as the controls. The essential oil could have prevented lipid peroxidation by mopping up ROS, prevented peroxyl radical formation and disable the radical from attacking another fatty acid to form lipid hydroperoxide. Thus, by preventing ROS production and lipid oxidation, the antioxidant activity of this essential oil may preserve foods from the toxic effects of oxidants [
