 <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] and its excessive production has been linked with several diseases [
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Consequently, oxidative stress resulting from imbalance between excessive generation of free radicals and inadequate antioxidant defense system has been linked to pathogenesis of many diseases such as diabetes, cancer, atherosclerosis and inflammation [

 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. In addition to this, synthetic antioxidants such as butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylhydroxytoluene (BHT) or propyl gallate, largely used as food additives, have been reported to be injurious to the human body [
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Therefore, while there is a need to enhance the antioxidant system in order to regain the balance, increased use of naturally occurring antioxidants has been considerably regarded as an effective and safe way to prevent ROS-induced diseases. While medicinal plants have been used in folk medicine for the treatment of numerous diseases, essential oil and various extracts from plant, for many decades, have been studied for their natural products, efficiency and effectiveness in the treatment of infectious and dreadful diseases [
 <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Since they possess compounds having protective effects against these diseases, essential oils and phenolic compounds of plant origin have been highly investigated by researchers for their antioxidant properties [
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Thus, polyphenolic compounds including flavonoids suppress reactive oxygen formation, chelate trace elements involved in free-radical production, scavenge reactive species and up-regulate and protect antioxidant defenses [
 <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] to contribute directly to antioxidant capacity and exhibit their protective functions against oxidative damage and health benefits [
