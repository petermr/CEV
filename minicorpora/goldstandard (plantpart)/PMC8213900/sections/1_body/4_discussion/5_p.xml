<p id="p0150">The result of antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of 
 <italic>E. caffra</italic> revealed that the oil possess good antimicrobial activity against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. The test bacterial isolates were susceptible to the essential oil with the exception of 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. In addition, the antibacterial activity could be attributed to the presence of caryophyllene oxide, a sesquiterpene oxide, which is predominant in the oil while the contribution of [1S-(1α,7α,8aβ)]-1,2,3,5,6,7,8,8a-octa-1 - hydro-1,8a-dimethyl-7-(1-methylethenyl)-Naphthalene (7.81%), Kauran-18-al (6.49%) and 10,10-Dimethyl-2,6-dimethylenebicy clo[7.2.0]undecan-5α-ol (5.83%) with unknown biological activities may not be underestimated. While sesquiterpenes and monoterpenes possess antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative human pathogens [
 <xref rid="bib92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>], the biological activity of essential oil of 
 <italic>E. caffra</italic> may be attributed to the presence of certain alcohols, ethers, ketone, and aldehyde identified as bioactive compounds from the GC-MS analysis of the extract. An important characteristic of essential oils and their constituents is their hydrophobicity which enables them to partition in the lipids of bacterial cell membrane and mitochondria thus disturbing the structures and rendering them more permeable [
