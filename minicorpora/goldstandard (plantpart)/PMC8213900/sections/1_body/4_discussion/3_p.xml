<p id="p0140">In this study, the antioxidant activities of the essential oil of 
 <italic>Erythrina caffra</italic> determined were higher and concentration-dependent moderate inhibitions in nitric oxide, reducing power, hydrogen peroxide, lipid peroxidation inhibitory assays, DPPH, and ABTS scavenging activity assays. While antioxidant efficiency is often associated with the ability of an extract to scavenge stable free radicals, this essential oil possessed the capability to scavenge the hydroxyl radical, superoxide radical, hydrogen peroxide, singlet oxygen and nitric monoxide produced with strong antioxidant activity better than the BHT and gallic acid used as control. That the essential oil of 
 <italic>E.Â caffra</italic> showed a concentration dependent activity against reactive oxygen species indicated that its administration could significantly increases superoxide dismutase which is the first antioxidant defense in an oxidative stress situation [
 <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] and catalase which catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water and molecular oxygen [
 <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] in a dose dependent manner. On the other hand, since the power of antioxidant activity to reduce ferric ion indicated the potential antioxidant activity, the exponential rise in antioxidant activity as a function of the reducing ability showed that antioxidant potentials are linked with reducing power [
 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Thus, while essential oils have therapeutic uses in human medicine due to its anticancer, antinociceptive, antibacterial and antioxidant properties [
 <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], they act as chain-breaking antioxidants to scavenge and destroy reactive oxygen species (ROS) [
