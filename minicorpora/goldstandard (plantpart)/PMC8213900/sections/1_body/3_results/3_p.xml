 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> shows a higher concentration dependent ABTS radical scavenging activity of the essential oil while those of both BHT and gallic acid indicated a constant value with a slight difference. Increase in concentrations indicated that both BHT and gallic acid were not significantly inhibited as the concentration of the essential oil increases. The essential oil was significantly more active against ABTS than the BHT and Gallic acid (ρ &lt; 0.05).
