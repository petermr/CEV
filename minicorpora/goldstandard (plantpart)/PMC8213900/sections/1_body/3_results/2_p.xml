<p id="p0095">In this study, there is an increasing trend in the antioxidant activity of the essential oil of 
 <italic>E. caffra</italic> with respect to concentration. This shows that as the concentration of the essential oil increases, the DPPH radical scavenging activity of the essential oil increases significantly in comparison with those of BHT and Gallic acid (ρ &lt; 0.05). However, reverse is the case in both butylated hydroxyl toluene (BHT) and gallic acid where both were decreasing as the concentration was increasing as shown in
