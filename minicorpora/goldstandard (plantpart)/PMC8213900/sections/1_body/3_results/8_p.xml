<p id="p0125">The susceptibility of the different test bacterial isolates to the activity of the essential oil and amoxicillin used as control was presented in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The susceptibility study showed that all bacterial isolates were susceptible to essential oil with the exception of 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. While the essential oil produced inhibition zones ranging between 22 ± 1.3 and 35 ± 2.1 mm in the susceptible isolates, amoxicillin produced inhibition zones ranging between 35 ± 2.1 and 40 ± 0.2 with the exception of 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> which is resistant to the antibacterial agents.
