<p id="Par10">On the other hand, exogenous ABA can act on the synthesis of enzymes involved in the primary and secondary metabolism of the plant and can induce an increase in the synthesis of phenolic compounds such as flavonoids and carotenoids (Stanley and Yuan 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2019</xref>; Gai et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2020</xref>). Also, several authors reported an increase in the production of phenolic compounds and others secondary metabolites after exogenous application of ABA (Sandhu et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2018</xref>). Furthermore, it appears that ABA may be involved in regulating the biosynthesis of plant phenolic compounds in plants subjected to drought stress (González‐Villagra et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2018</xref>; Gai et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2020</xref>). However, its application does not always generate univocal and immediate answers in all plant species (Negin and Moshelion
