<p id="Par11">Even though several strategies have been proposed to mitigate the negative effects of drought stress in plants, to our knowledge there is little information about the physiological role of ABA in drought stress alleviation in 
 <italic>D. moldavica</italic> and no such study has been conducted under field conditions. Therefore, this study was initiated to evaluate the drought tolerance ability of 
 <italic>D. moldavica</italic> and determined the effects of different concentration of exogenous ABA on growth and yield under drought condition. Furthermore, given the involvement of ABA in the synthesis of carotenoids and flavonoids in drought conditions, the content of phenolic compounds in 
 <italic>D. moldavica</italic> was evaluated under water stress conditions.
