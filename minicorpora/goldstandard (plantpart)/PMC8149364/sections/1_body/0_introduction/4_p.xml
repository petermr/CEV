<p id="Par9">Endogenous abscisic acid (ABA), together with other hormonal signals, regulates the processes of transpiration and foliar photosynthesis, induces stomatal closure, inhibits the growth of the aerial part, regulates seed dormancy, is involved in the response of plants to stress (Moreira et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2020</xref>). In particular, it plays a vital role in the adaptive growth responses to drought (Lu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2009</xref>). Some physiological and morphological responses such as photosynthesis and leaf expansion have been reported to be affected by ABA (Umezawa 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2011</xref>). Moreover, endogenous ABA can be involved in the biosynthetic pathway of phenolic compounds (Castellarin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2012</xref>).
