 <sub>3</sub>), 2.8 ml of deionized water, and 0.1 ml of 50% Folin–Ciocalteau reagent, and then incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Absorbance was measured at 765 nm against a deionized water blank on a spectrophotometer (Lambda 25, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). As suggested by (Meda et al.
