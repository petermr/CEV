<p id="Par16">At the late flowering stage (85 days after planting), 
 <italic>D. moldavica</italic> plant growth parameters such as plant height, number of stem branches, leaf dry weight, leaf area and total biomass were recorded. At each sampling, all 
 <italic>D. moldavica</italic> plants from a 50-cm length of the three middle rows of each plot were harvested by cutting at the soil surface. The areas of green leaves were measured using a leaf area meter (model: VM-900 E/K). All plant parts were oven-dried at 70 °C for 48 h until a constant weight was reached. At maturity (about four months after planting), the plants in an area of 1 m
 <sup>2</sup> were harvested to determine seed yield and 1000 seed weight.
