 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The 30-year annual mean temperature and precipitation were 11 ºC and 293 mm, respectively. The region is characterized by a cool semi-arid climate. The soil type was a sandy loam with a pH of 7.32. Soil properties of experimental site including electrical conductivity, organic matter content, total nitrogen, available phosphorus and available potassium were 1.2 (dS/m), 1.75%, 0.2%, 8.4 ppm and 156 ppm, respectively. The land was prepared by plowing and leveling before planting. The seeds of
