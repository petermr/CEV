<p id="Par14">The soil water content was monitored daily and, the data were converted to the soil matric suction using soil water characteristics curve (SWC) obtained experimentally. The SWC was obtained using a sandbox (0.1–15 kPa), pressure plate (30–100 kPa), and pressure membrane apparatus (100–1500 kPa) (Dane and Hopmans

After that, the plots were re-watered. In the well-watered treatment, the plots were re-watered to the field capacity by replacing the amount of water transpired every second day.
