<p id="Par13">The experiment was arranged in a split-plot based on randomized complete block design with three replications. Three watering regimes [well-watered, moderate drought (delay irrigation up to − 8 bar) and severe drought (delay irrigation up to − 15 bar)] were set as the main plot and different ABA concentrations (0, 5, 10, 20 and 40 µM) were set as subplots. The mentioned water potential to apply drought was determined by the field moisture curve.</p>
