 <italic>Dracocephalum moldavica</italic> seed yield was significantly affected by watering regimes, ABA and interactions among the independent variable. The experiment results were not different for 2 consecutive years (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). Averaged over the 2 years, without ABA application, moderate and severe drought caused 21.21% and 30.88% reduction in seed yield compared with well-watered condition, respectively. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>, increase in ABA concentrations was associated with reduction of seed yield. The lowest seed yield was obtained from plants treated with 40 μM ABA in all three moisture regimes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>), which was less than control under well-watered, moderate and severe drought conditions 14.28%, 23.94% and 32.13%, respectively.
