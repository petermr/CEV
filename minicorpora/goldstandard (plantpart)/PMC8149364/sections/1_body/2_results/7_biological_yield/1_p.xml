<p id="Par28">Watering regimes, ABA and their interaction significantly (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) altered plant biological yield, but the effect of the year treatment was not significant (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). Without ABA application, moderate and severe drought decreased biological yield by 18.17% and 39.83%, respectively, compared to well-watered condition. ABA application caused a descending trend in biological yield, meaning that biological yield decreased with increasing ABA concentration in all moisture conditions (Fig.
