<p id="Par27">According to the results of variance analysis, leaf dry weight (LDW) did not differ (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) among 2 years. Without ABA application, moderate and severe drought caused 18.05% and 30.15% reduction in LDW compared with well-watered condition, respectively. Watering regimes, ABA and interaction of ABA × watering regimes effects on LDW were significant at 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001. With increasing ABA concentration, LDW decreased, and the highest and lowest LDW was obtained from control and ABA 40 μM concentration, respectively, in three moisture conditions (Fig.
