 <sup>−1</sup>) was obtained in well-watered condition, which was 41.82% and 61.06% more than moderate and severe drought conditions, respectively. ABA application, showed a decreasing trend in transpiration rate under well-watered and moderate drought conditions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). However, there was no difference between different concentrations of ABA under severe drought conditions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).
