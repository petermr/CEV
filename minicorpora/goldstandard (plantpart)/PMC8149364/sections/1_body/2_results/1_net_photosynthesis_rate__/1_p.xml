<p id="Par21">Net photosynthesis rate (PN) was similar in both years (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Averaged over 2 years, the highest PN was obtained from plant grown in well-watered condition, while moderate and severe drought, decreased PN by 26.39% and 34.43%, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The effect of ABA application and its interaction with watering regimes on PN was significant (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, there was a decreasing trend in PN associated with increasing ABA concentration in all watering regimes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The response of stomatal conduction to drought and ABA application was similar to net photosynthesis rate, in this study. The results were similar in both years of the experiment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Without ABA application, the highest stomatal conductance was obtained under well-watered condition, and moderate and severe drought reduced stomatal conductance by 20.97% and 54.11%, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Exogenous ABA application clearly reduced the stomatal conductance in all three moisture regimes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) and the lowest stomatal conductance (0.02 mol m
 <sup>−2</sup> s
 <sup>−1</sup>) was obtained from plants treated by ABA 50 µM concentration under severe drought condition (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).
