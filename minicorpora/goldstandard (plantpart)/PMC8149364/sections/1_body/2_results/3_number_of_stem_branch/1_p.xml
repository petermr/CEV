<p id="Par24">Watering regimes significantly altered the number of stem branch (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Moderate and severe drought decreased the number of stem branch 30.37 and 50.13%, respectively, compared to the well-watered condition. The effect of ABA and interaction between watering regimes and ABA on the number of stem branch was not significant, but there was a significant effect in interaction of watering regimes and ABA (Fig.
