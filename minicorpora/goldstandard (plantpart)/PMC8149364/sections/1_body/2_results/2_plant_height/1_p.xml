 <italic>Dracocephalum moldavica</italic> plant height was not different between the 2 years across treatments (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). Averaged over 2 years data, the moderate and severe drought decreased plant height by 19.77 and 35.21% compared with well-watered condition. The effect of ABA and interaction of ABA × watering regimes on plant height was significant (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Overall, plant height decreased with increasing ABA concentrations in all of moisture regimes. The lowest plant height was obtained from plants treated by ABA 40 µM in all moisture regimes, which was 23%, 26.45% and 28.54% lower than control (non-application of ABA) under well-watered, moderate and severe drought conditions, respectively (Fig.
