<p id="Par31">As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>, total phenolic content were affected by watering regimes, ABA and interaction among the independent variables. Total phenolic content was not different (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) among 2 years (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>). Without the ABA treatment, the highest total phenolic content was obtained from plants grown in moderate drought conditions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>), respectively, 5.64 and 9.02% higher than plants grown in severe drought conditions and in good irrigation conditions. However, depending on watering regimes, plants obviously showed a different response to ABA treatment in terms of total phenolic content. Overall, the maximum total phenolic content (8.9 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>FW) was obtained in moderate drought condition with the application of 20 μM ABA while the future increase in ABA concentration decreased it (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>). There was an increasing trend in total phenolic content with increasing in ABA concentration up to 20 μM in the plant grown well-watered and severe drought conditions and then it remained almost stable up to 40 μM ABA (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>).
