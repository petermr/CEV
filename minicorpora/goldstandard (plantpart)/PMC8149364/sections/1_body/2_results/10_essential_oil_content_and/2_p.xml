<p id="Par33">The essential oil yield was significantly affected by watering regimes, ABA and interactions among the independent variable (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref>b). Without ABA application, plant grown under moderate drought had higher essential oil yield than plants grown under well-watered and severe drought conditions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref>b). Plant essential oil yield response to ABA application varied depending on the moisture conditions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref>b). In the well-watered condition, application of ABA had a positive effect on essential oil yield and there was an increasing trend in essential oil yield, associated with increasing ABA concentration (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref>b). The highest essential oil yield (19.58 kg ha
 <sup>−1</sup>) was obtained from 5 µM ABA concentration under moderate drought condition (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref>b). In the severe condition, essential oil yield was not significantly affected by the ABA exogenous application (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref>b).
