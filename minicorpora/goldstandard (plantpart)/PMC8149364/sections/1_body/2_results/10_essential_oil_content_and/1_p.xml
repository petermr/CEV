 <italic>D. moldavica</italic> plants grown under moderate and severe drought conditions, respectively, had 45.45% and 37.5% more essential oil content, than well-watered conditions. The maximum essential oil content (0.58%) accumulated in plants that grown under moderate drought condition and treated with 5 µM ABA (Fig.
