<p id="Par45">In this study, we analyzed the roles of exogenous ABA on some physiological, morphological and metabolic parameters of 
 <italic>D. moldavica</italic> under drought stress. The study showed that severe and moderate drought reduce photosynthetic efficiency and alter transpiation processes and leaf morphology. Exogenous ABA does not restore these impaired functions but improves secondary metabolism. 
 <italic>D. moldavica</italic> produces high quantities of some secondary metabolites such as phenolic compounds and essential oil as a response to stress condition. In particular, a concentration of 5 µM of exogenous ABA is required to activate the biosynthetic pathway of essential oils and 20 µM for phenolic compounds in 
 <italic>D. moldavica</italic> under moderate drought. This can be explained by the existence of multiple biosynthetic pathways of the secondary metabolites of 
 <italic>D. moldavica</italic> activated by different dosages of ABA. Unfortunately, a critical aspect of this manuscript is that it did not assess endogenous ABA levels. The quantification of the endogenous levels of ABA could have better clarify the signaling involved in the biosynthetic pathways of phenols and essential oils. Therefore, extreme ecological conditions and treatment with ABA should be considered economically and pharmaceutically significant in 
 <italic>D. moldavica</italic> cultivation, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. This study will contribute to the understanding of the abiotic stress resilience mechanism in 
 <italic>D. moldavica</italic> and provide new insights to improve 
 <italic>D. moldavica</italic> drought tolerance in the future.
