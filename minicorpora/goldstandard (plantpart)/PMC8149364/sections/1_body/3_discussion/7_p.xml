 <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>). Studies with exogenous application of ABA suggest that cell division and developing processes under full water conditions, showed similar responses to those of water deficit and led to lower seed-set and seed development (Myers et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">1998</xref>). Trivedi et al. (
