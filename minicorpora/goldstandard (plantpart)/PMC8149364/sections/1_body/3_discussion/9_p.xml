<p id="Par42">Essential oil content significantly affected by drought (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref>a, b). Akula and Ravishankar (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2011</xref>) have reported that plants increased essential oil content as a defense system to protect against ROS when exposed to drought conditions. Selmar and Kleinwächter (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2013</xref>) showed that the total monoterpenes concentration of sage plant was significantly higher under drought stress compared to normal irrigated plants. The results of the present study showed that, under severe drought conditions, the essential oil yield decreased despite the increasing in essential oil percentage, (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref>a, b). In drought conditions, accumulation of plants biomass decreases, so the percentage of essential oil increases without increasing in the biosynthesis of the essential oil content. However, drought increases the activity of the essential oil biosynthetic pathway enzymes (Selmar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2017</xref>). Since the essential oil yield is related to the interaction between the essential oil percentage and dry weight production (Baher et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2002</xref>), increasing drought intensity leads to an increase in the essential oil percentage and decreases leaf yield, which ultimately reduces the essential oil yield.
