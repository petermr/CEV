<p id="Par39">The seed yield decreased under drought stress conditions in this experiment. Under water deficit, the duration of seed filling may be controlled by the increased rate of leaf senescence, which regulated by the nitrogen status of the plant (De Souza et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1997</xref>). Drought stress during seed filling generally decreases nitrogen accumulation of new plant tissues (Frederick and Camberato 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1995</xref>). Drought mainly influences seed yield by limiting seed numbers by either influencing the amount of dry matter produced by the time of flowering or by directly influencing pollen or ovule function, which leads to decreased seed-set. Secondarily, drought influences seed filling mainly by limiting the assimilate supply, leading to smaller seed size and lower yields (Frederick et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1991</xref>).
