<p id="Par35">Compared to well-watered condition, drought stress severely decreased PN in 
 <italic>D. moldavica</italic> plants (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Stomatal closure (shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) due to drought leads to a decrease in intercellular CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentrations (data not shown). In addition, drought can disturbs the photosynthesis pathway key enzymes activity such as ribulose–1, 5–bisphosphate carboxylase–oxygenase (Rubisco) and fructose–1,6–bisphosphatase (FBP) (Webber et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">1994</xref>; Vu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">1999</xref>). According to our results, PN decreased with increasing in ABA concentration (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Our results indicated that a reduction in PN with increasing ABA concentration (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) attributed to diffusive related to stomatal conductance limitations in ABA-treated plants (shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). ABA can regulate stomatal closure by Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> and K
 <sup>+</sup> outflowing in the guard cell membrane (Pei et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2000</xref>) and causing photosynthesis inhibition (Zhou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2006</xref>).
