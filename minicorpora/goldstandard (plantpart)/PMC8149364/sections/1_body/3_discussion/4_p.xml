<p id="Par37">The reduction in photosynthetic yield caused by ABA is closely associated with the development of photosynthetic organs such as leaves. Indeed, leaf area responded negatively to increasing concentration of ABA. ABA plays a key role in stomatal regulation (Wu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">1997</xref>). The causal association between elevated ABA levels and reduced stomatal aperture under stress conditions has been well established (Hsiao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1976</xref>). The application of exogenous ABA causes reduction in the stomatal conductance and hence PN (Li et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2004</xref>), which subsequently leads to a decrease in growth and number and area of the leaves due to the decrease in assimilates flow. The leaf production in ABA-treated watermelon (Agehara and Leskovar 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2014</xref>) and 
 <italic>Catharanthus</italic> plants (Jaleel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2006</xref>) was reduced. In addition, ABA reduced the leaf number in 
 <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic> (Nair et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2009</xref>). The plant height also decreased under stressful conditions. In drought stress conditions because of reduction in citokinins transport from root to shoot or because of an increased amount of ABA in leaves, the flexibility of the cells wall decreased, so plant growth is reduced. El-antably (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1974</xref>) reported that ABA reduced plant height of corn and sorghum significantly by about 15 and 11%, respectively, by cessation of extension growth in both corn and sorghum plants. This may be an indirect effect of ABA on inhibition of shoot growth. The application of ABA reduced plant height. ABA can act as an inhibitor of the elongation of the stem in some plants, including eggplant (Latimer and Mitchell 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1988</xref>), cucumber (Yamazaki et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">1995</xref>) and pepper (Biai et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2011</xref>).
