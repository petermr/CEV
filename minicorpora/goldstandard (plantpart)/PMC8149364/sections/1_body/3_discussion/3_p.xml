<p id="Par36">In this study, drought stress markedly reduced leaf area, leaf dry weight, height, biological yield, seed yield of 
 <italic>D. moldavica</italic> plants compared to well-watered plants, and this effect was more pronounced with the severity of drought (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Under drought conditions, leaf area was sharply reduced due to reduction in leaf growth and increasing leaf abscission (Anyia and Herzog
