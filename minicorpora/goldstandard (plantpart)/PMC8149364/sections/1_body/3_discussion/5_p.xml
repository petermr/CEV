 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>. Leaf dry weight and biomass accumulation are very sensitive to water deficit because they are dependent on cell expansion (Hsiao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1976</xref>; Hearn 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1994</xref>). Loka et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2011</xref>) reported that drought caused a reduction in the whole plant leaf area by decreasing the initiation of new leaves and a decrease in leaf size. The result of reduced leaf growth is the reduction of biomass accumulation. A common detrimental effect of water deficit on plants production is the reduction in fresh and dry biomass production (Zhao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2006</xref>). Kamara et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2003</xref>) reported that drought significantly reduced total dry weight in maize. Leaf dry weight and biological yield decreased by application of ABA (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). ABA has also been shown to be involved in mobilization of reserves under drought stress conditions. Yin et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2004</xref>) reported that exogenous application of ABA in 
 <italic>Populus kangdingensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Populus cathayana</italic> reduced total dry weight. ABA is also involved in many physiological processes, such as photosynthesis. It has been demonstrated that ABA plays important roles in stomatal conductance (Phillips et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">1997</xref>), the stability of photosynthetic apparatus (Xu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">1995</xref>; Gong et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1998</xref>) and the assimilates production (Alamillo and Bartels 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2001</xref>). Plant production and finally biological yield of 
 <italic>D. moldavica</italic> plant decreased due to reduced photosynthetic activity.
