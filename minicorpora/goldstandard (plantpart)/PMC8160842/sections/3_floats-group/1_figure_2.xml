  <p>Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis for the essential oil combination of black pepper + rosemary (BR) at different temperatures (15, 25, and 35 °C) and different times of storage (1–3 months) (different colors refer to different temperature per subfigure). (
   <bold>a</bold>) This figure refer to the effect of different temperature at 15, 25, and 35 °C on the combination of BR stored for one month; (
   <bold>b</bold>) the second subfigure refer to different temperature at 15, 25, and 35 °C on the combination of BR stored for two months; (
   <bold>c</bold>) the third subfigure refer to different temperature at 15, 25, and 35 °C on the combination of BR stored for three months.
