<p>Green peach aphid (GPA) or peach-potato aphid 
 <italic>Myzus persicae</italic> (Sulzer) belongs to the family Aphididae in the order Hemiptera. This species is considered a polyphagous species that can be found worldwide and globally distributed. The GPA has been reported to feed on more than 500 species of plants from 40 plant families and is considered a major pest of many vegetable crops and plant families such as cucurbits, legumes, crucifers like cabbage, cauliflower, and broccoli, and solanaceous crops like potato, tomato, and capsicum. In addition, fruit crops such as peach trees, for example, serve as 
 <italic>M. persicae</italic> hosts [

 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-03055" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. GPA damage comes from their feeding on plant sap, which causes yellowing and leaf curling of the plant. In addition, 
 <italic>M. persicae</italic> has been involved in transmitting over 180 plant viruses. Hence, GPA, with a large host range exceeding 50 families of plants, is considered one of the most polyphagous aphids [
