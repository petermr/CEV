<p>The combinations of essential oil samples were prepared by mixing different binary types of essential oils in the ratio (1:1) and storing at three different temperatures, which were 15, 25, and 35 °C, for one, two, and three months. The FTIR was conducted after three months to determine the essential oil contents’ stability of functional groups for the combination. A small drop of around 1 mL of the essential oil was placed on the plate and the spectrum run. The plates were thoroughly cleaned after each scan of an essential oil to prevent contamination of other samples and the diamond wiped with a tissue, then washed several times with methylene chloride, then ethanol, to remove the sample. The cleaned surface was clear and free from scratches.</p>
