<p>Four concentrations were used to test the contact toxicity for 10 essential oils, which were four pure essential oils of black pepper, eucalyptus blue gum, rosemary, and tea tree and six binary mixtures of essential oils of black pepper + eucalyptus, black pepper + rosemary, black pepper + tea tree, eucalyptus + rosemary, eucalyptus + tea tree, and rosemary + tea tree (BE, BR, BT, ER, ET, and TR). Three replications were used per treatment of essential oil for the pure and mixture. The control treatment was treated as above but using the solvent only. Between 20 and 30 aphids (different stages of aphids) were placed on filter paper in a 9 cm Petri dish. Each treatment was sprayed by using a micro-spray size 5 mL sprayer, and 1 mL of essential oil was applied according to each concentration. Petri dishes were covered with mesh and placed in an incubator chamber (25 ± 2 °C, 16:8, L:D, 65 ± 5% RH). Mortality was determined under a microscope after 1, 3, 6, 8, and 24 h. Three replicates were used for each concentration.</p>
