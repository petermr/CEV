<p>GC-MS analysis was carried out for 100% pure essential oil of black pepper, eucalyptus blue gum, rosemary, and tea tree, and their binary combinations by using a Shimadzu GC-MS model QP2010 series, installed with an SGE main category BPX5 column, using 30 m × 0.25 mm film thickness 0.25 μm (Kinesis Australia Pty Ltd., Qld, Australia) and AOC-5000 autosampler (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) as an autosampler. The parameter of GC-MS analysis used the following method: injector temperature 220 °C; pressure 63.43 kPa; column flow 1.07 mL/min; linear velocity 37.8 cm/s; sample injected volume 1 μL diluted with hexane. Gas chromatography coupled to a mass selective detector (MSD) were recorded with ionization and interface temperature of 200 °C; the solvent cut time was 1.5 min and the carrier gas helium. Two replicates for each essential oil were injected. The individual constituent of each essential oil was identified and achieved by comparing the obtained mass spectra for each component with the values stored in mass spectra libraries and the NIST database with data previously reported in the literature. The percentage composition of the oils was calculated in peak areas using the normalization method.</p>
