<p>All the mixtures of essential oils tested were active toward aphids (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03055-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Some of the combinations of essential oils tested, such as BT, ET, and TR, caused more than 80% mortality in GPA at the maximum dose used after 24 h, while doses of 1 and 2% in some other combinations of essential oils showed less mortality than all types of combinations of essential oils. The contact activities of the three combinations TR, BT, and ET of essential oils (EOs) showed the highest mortality in the range of 93 to 98% at the concentrations of 3 and 5% for 24 h exposure time and R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.787 (Adjusted R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.78). However, the contact activities of other combinations of EOs were not ideal, causing less than 50â€“70% mortality during the 24 h exposure. The results of contact toxicity against GPA showed no significant differences between the EOs after 24 h exposure time.
