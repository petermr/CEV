<p>Insecticidal activity among four types of essential oils (black pepper, eucalyptus, rosemary and tea tree) were investigated (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03055-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The following EO combinations showed several synergistic interactions; the most significant synergy based on Wadley’s determination was the combination of BT, ET, and TR. the binary combination of two essential oils produced lower LC
 <sub>50</sub> than the individual oil. The synergy interaction was found with the mixture of black pepper and tea tree, eucalyptus and tea tree, as well as tea tree and rosemary based on Wadley’s calculation, and the synergy ratio was 
 <italic>R</italic> &gt; 1.5. However, the combination of black pepper and eucalyptus, black pepper and rosemary, and eucalyptus and rosemary showed additive interaction because the synergy ratio was 
 <italic>R</italic> &lt; 1.5. No one of the essential oil mixtures showed antagonistic interaction 
 <italic>R</italic> &lt; 0.5 based on Wadley’s calculation.
