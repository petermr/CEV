<p>We observed that individual oils varied in their toxicity to the aphids and some oil types were more toxic to aphids, especially in a high dose. The mixed binary essential oils were also shown to be additive, synergistic, and no combinations were antagonistic. We found their toxicity was as high as expected, especially with a short time and a low dose. The toxicity of the binary mixtures of oils increased the mortality of aphids. This indicated that some combinations had a synergistic effect; however, synergistic activities were observed in the BT, ET, and TR combinations, LC
 <sub>50</sub> values were 1.57, 2.36, and 2.23, respectively, compared with individual LC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 5.16, 8.27, 5.03, and 7.76 for B, E, T, and R, respectively (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03055-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). In most mixtures, additive interaction was observed between two mixed oils such as BE, BR, and ER, and that happened because the binary combination may have returned to the interaction between the essential oils’ components [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-26-03055" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Synergistic interaction in the cases of BT, ET, and TR against 
 <italic>M. persicae</italic> can be attributed to: (1) the difference in the insecticidal mechanisms of black pepper and tea tree from other essential oils on 
 <italic>M. persicae</italic>; and (2) the synergistic effect being due to the essential oils’ compounds interaction. These findings were parallel to Pavela [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-26-03055" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], who reported that synergistic insecticidal activities could be observed not only in the combination of essential oils but also in their constituents, as well as between synthetic insecticides with essential oils.
