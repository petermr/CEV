 <p>The insecticidal activities of essential oils obtained from black pepper, eucalyptus, rosemary, and tea tree and their binary combinations were investigated against the green peach aphid, 
  <italic>Myzus persicae</italic> (Aphididae: Hemiptera), under laboratory and glasshouse conditions. All the tested essential oils significantly reduced and controlled the green peach aphid population and caused higher mortality. In this study, black pepper and tea tree pure essential oils were found to be an effective insecticide, with 80% mortality when used through contact application. However, for combinations of essential oils from black pepper + tea tree (BT) and rosemary + tea tree (RT) tested as contact treatment, the mortality was 98.33%. The essential oil combinations exhibited synergistic and additive interactions for insecticidal activities. The combination of black pepper + tea tree, eucalyptus + tea tree (ET), and tea tree + rosemary showed enhanced activity, with synergy rates of 3.24, 2.65, and 2.74, respectively. Essential oils formulation was effective on the mortality of aphids. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis showed that stability of a mixture of essential oils was not affected by store temperature (15, 25, and 35 Â°C) and the functional groups were not changed during storage. Based on our results, the essential oils can be used as a commercial insecticide against 
  <italic>M. persicae</italic>.
