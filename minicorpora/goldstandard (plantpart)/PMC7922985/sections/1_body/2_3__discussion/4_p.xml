<p>The experiment performed with pure α-TA (analytical standard) and with α-TA essential oil, confirmed that this compound caused phytotoxic effect. Synergy of α-TA with other chemical compounds of α-TA essential oil could explain higher phytotoxic effect of α-TA essential oil than pure α-TA. For example, when second compound α-terpineol was abundant enough in α-TA essential oil (14.34%) the affect could even increase.</p>
