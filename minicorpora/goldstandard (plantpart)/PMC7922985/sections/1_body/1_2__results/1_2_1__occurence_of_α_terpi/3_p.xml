<p>The map of α-TA distribution between investigated 
 <italic>T. pulegioides</italic> habitats demonstrated increasing trend of α-TA from the western to the eastern part of Lithuania (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01065-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Sixty percent of 
 <italic>T. pulegioides</italic> habitats, in which α-TA was found, were located in slopes with southern, southwestern, south-eastern, and eastern exposures. Calculated Spearman‘s correlation coefficient (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.66, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) demonstrated positive tendency between α-TA amount and the size of these slopes: the higher percentage of α-TA was found in habitats located in southern, southwestern, southeastern, and eastern slopes with higher inclines. It was observed that phenolic carvacrol was the most common compound of 
 <italic>T. pulegioides</italic> essential oils. Though, the demonstrated carvacrol isomer thymol amount was about 5.5 times lower than carvacrol (
