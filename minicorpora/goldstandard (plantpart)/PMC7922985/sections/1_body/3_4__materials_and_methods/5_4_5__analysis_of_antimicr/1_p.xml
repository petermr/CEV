 <sc>l</sc>-glutamine without sodium bicarbonate (Sigma Aldrich, Germany) for fungi and yeasts, Mueller–Hinton broth (Oxoid, England) for bacteria, both in 96-well plates. Samples of oil were added to the first well Finally, the suspensions of cultures were added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h or 48 h to get reliable microbial growth. A suspension of microorganisms in the medium without essential oil and α-TA served as growth control. A 50% or 10% (

 <italic>v</italic>) ethanol was used as a negative control for the solvent influence. To control the sensitivity of the test organisms the MIC values of gentamycin (
 <italic>E. coli</italic>), vancomycin (
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>) and itraconazole for yeasts, fungi and dermatophytes were individually performed in parallel experiments. The MIC of gentamycin, vancomycin and itraconazole were determined using Liofilchem
 <sup>®</sup> MIC test strip (Liofilchem, Roseto degli Abruzzi (TE), Italy), Interpretative Criteria and Quality Control Rev.27/27.01.2017. After incubation, the growth of microorganisms was indicated by the presence of turbidity and ‘pellets’ on the well bottom. MICs were determined presumptively as the first well, in ascending order, which did not produce a pellet. The wells with no visible growth were selected and samples were used to determine minimum bactericidal and fungicidal concentration (MBC and MFC). Briefly, after homogenization a 10 µL of each suspension was cultured on Mueller-Hinton agar or Sabouraud dextrose agar. This culture was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h for bacteria or at 35 °C for 48 h for fungi, yeast and dermatophytes. The MBC or MFC was estimated from the culture medium in which no visible microbial growth was recorded during examination. The tests were performed in triplicate [
