<p>In this study, as test organisms the following microorganism were used: 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 29213, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC 25922, 
 <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> SC 6359, 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> CBS 120264, 
 <italic>Trichophyton rubrum</italic> ATCC 28188, 
 <italic>T. mentagrophytes</italic> ATCC 9533, 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> CBS 2730, and 
 <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> CBS 8836. The bacteria strains were maintained on nutrient agar (Liofilchem, Italy), fungi and yeasts on Sabouraud dextrose agar (Liofilchem, Italy) slants and stored at 4 °C. Bacterial inoculum was obtained from cultures incubated at 37 °C for 24 h on nutrient agar and diluted according to the 0.5 McFarland standards to approximately 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL. Suspensions of fungal spores were prepared from fresh mature (3- to 7-day-old) cultures that grew at 30 °C on a Sabouraud dextrose agar. Spores were rinsed with sterile water with 0.05% Tween 80 to determine turbidity spectrophotometrically at 530 nm, according to the conidial size of the species (0.09 to 0.3 optical densities) [

 <italic>Candida</italic> yeasts were grown on Sabouraud dextrose agar at 30 °C for 48 h. The yeasts were collected and adjusted to 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL (corresponding to an OD
 <sub>530 nm</sub> = 0.12–0.15) [
