 <p>The aim of this study was to evaluate occurrence of 
  <italic>T. pulegioides</italic> α-terpinyl acetate chemotype, as source of natural origin α-terpinyl acetate, to determine its phytotoxic and antimicrobial features. Were investigated 131 
  <italic>T. pulegioides</italic> habitats. Essential oils were isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC-FID and GC-MS. Phytotoxic effect of essential oil of this chemotype on monocotyledons and dicotyledons through water and air was carried out in laboratory conditions; the broth microdilution method was used to screen essential oil effect against human pathogenic microorganisms. Results showed that α-terpinyl acetate was very rare compound in essential oil of 
  <italic>T. pulegioides</italic>: it was found only in 35% of investigated 
  <italic>T. pulegioides</italic> habitats. α-Terpinyl acetate (in essential oil and pure) demonstrated different behavior on investigated plants. Phytotoxic effect of α-terpinyl acetate was stronger on investigated monocotyledons than on dicotyledons. α-Terpinyl acetate essential oil inhibited seeds germination and radicles growth for high economic productivity forage grass monocotyledon 
  <italic>Poa pratensis</italic>, but stimulated seed germination for high economic productive forage legume dicotyledon 
  <italic>Trifolium pretense</italic>. α-Terpinyl acetate essential oil showed high antimicrobial effect against fungi and dermatophytes but lower effect against bacteria and 
  <italic>Candida</italic> yeasts. Therefore, 
  <italic>T. pulegioides</italic> α-terpinyl acetate chemotype could be a potential compound for developing preventive measures or/and drugs for mycosis.
