However, essential oils are highly unstable and prone to degradation when exposed to the environment during storage. Microencapsulation techniques help to maintain the stability of molecules in essential oils that are sensitive to environmental stress, and therefore improve shelf life. In this study, the physical stability and efficacy of a repellent formulation consisting of encapsulated <italic>Citrus grandis</italic> essential oil (CGEO) were evaluated under different storage conditions over a 12-month period by comparing the formulation with a non-encapsulated formulation. The formulations were both stored under two different storage conditions, i.e., 25 &#x000b1; 2 &#x000b0;C/60% &#x000b1; 5% relative humidity (RH) and 40 &#x000b1; 2 &#x000b0;C/75% RH &#x000b1; 5%, for 12 months. Droplet size, zeta potential, and pH value were measured after 1, 6, and 12 months of storage to determine their stability. For the study of efficacy, each formulation was tested against <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> under laboratory conditions. We found that the microencapsulated formulation&#x02019;s physical characteristics showed insignificant changes as compared with the non-encapsulated formulation during storage. The microencapsulated formulation demonstrated better repellent effects, sustaining high protection (&#x0003e;80%) for 4 more hours of exposure after 12 months of storage as compared with the non-encapsulated formulation that demonstrated high protection for only an hour post application. Microencapsulation helped to preserve the stability of the formulation, which resulted in high protection being maintained for over 12 months of storage.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>stability</kwd><kwd>microencapsulation</kwd><kwd>repellent</kwd><kwd><italic>Citrus grandis</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-molecules-26-03599"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Essential oils are the secondary metabolites produced and stored in the secretory glands of aromatic plants [<xref rid="B1-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Independently, they play an important role in a plant&#x02019;s defensive mechanisms against fungi, pathogenic microorganisms, herbivores, and insects [<xref rid="B3-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Due to these functions, essential oils are widely used in the medicinal, pharmaceutical, cosmetics, as well as pesticide and insecticide industries [<xref rid="B4-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In the insecticide industry, in particular, plant extracts are extensively used as active ingredients in repellent products, which are now receiving more attention from consumers than the synthetic repellents. An example of a synthetic repellent is diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), which has been found to cause skin irritation and sensitization for some individuals and poses a toxicity effect in infants and young children. Therefore, nowadays, customers are keen to choose plant-based repellents to protect themselves against mosquito bites [<xref rid="B5-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>For decades, thousands of plants have been screened as potential sources of repellent and insecticides. However, only a few plants have been registered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA). Citronella, lemon, and eucalyptus oils are among the natural ingredients that have obtained approval due to their relatively low toxicity and acceptable efficacy, and therefore are often selected by many manufacturers as the ingredients in their plant-based repellents [<xref rid="B5-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Currently, there are several plant-based repellent products available on the market that consist of the abovementioned ingredients. Unfortunately, although these products are preferred over synthetic products, the majority of them have been shown to have a short protection time of less than two hours as compared with synthetic repellents that mostly possess up to four hours of protection [<xref rid="B6-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This attribute may be associated with the highly volatile and lipophilic constituents of the botanical extract, which are significantly subjected to conversion and degradation reactions, such as the oxidative process [<xref rid="B7-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Furthermore, exposure to environmental factors such as air, light, and elevated temperature can cause these substances to become unstable, thus, resulting in a reduction in the quality of certain properties [<xref rid="B8-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition, the breakdown of botanical insecticides is significantly faster when they are exposed to the environment as compared with synthetic insecticides [<xref rid="B9-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Botanical insecticides, therefore, must be rigorously improved to achieve an acceptable level of effectiveness if they are to compete against synthetic insecticides [<xref rid="B10-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Several techniques and methods in the formulation process have been developed in recent years to improve the stability of botanical extracts and essential oils. Microencapsulation, in particular, is one of the techniques used to protect the essential oils that can simply undergo degradation [<xref rid="B9-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This technique involves the production of an outer coating (i.e., wall) that surrounds the particles of an essential oil (i.e., core) by using a polymer (i.e., synthetic or natural). The wall protects the unstable core material from the environment and can further control its volatility, subsequently extending the release rate of the essential oil and improving product effectiveness [<xref rid="B12-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The preparation technique used is not the only factor that influences the effectiveness of a repellent product; the stability of its formulation is also an important component that determines the effectiveness of a product [<xref rid="B13-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, identifying a preparation technique that improves or maintains the stability of a formulation during storage is an important objective of among studies. During the development of a repellent product, it is necessary to determine suitable storage conditions that can preserve the product&#x02019;s obtained stability. For example, an unsuitable temperature can change the product&#x02019;s physical stability and lead to a destabilization effect on the formulation, which directly affects the product&#x02019;s quality, efficacy, and safety [<xref rid="B14-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Moreover, the droplet size, polydispersity index, pH, and viscosity are among the important characteristics for determining the stability of the formulation. Accordingly, different preparation techniques produce varying characteristics.</p><p><italic>Citrus grandis</italic> (L.) Osbeck, commonly known as pomelo or &#x0201d;Limau Bali&#x0201d; is one of the species in the family of Zingiberaceae, which is widely distributed throughout the tropics, particularly in Southeast Asia. It is round in shape, greenish in color, 15&#x02013;25 cm in diameter, and usually weighs about 1&#x02013;2 kg [<xref rid="B16-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The Department of Agriculture of Malaysia reported that pomelo production in Malaysia increased significantly from 1960 to 2014. Approximately 1009 ha of land had been used for pomelo plantations that produced 11,830.6 metric tons per year. Pomelo is usually consumed fresh or used for flavoring by the food and beverage industries. Meanwhile, their peel is discarded as waste. Since 30% of pomelo weight is derived from its peel, this reflects around 1956 metric tons (9.4 billion Ringgit Malaysia/USD 2.4 million) of pomelo peel being discarded per year in 2014 [<xref rid="B17-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], without recognizing their possible nutritional and therapeutic values. Pomelo peel is composed of various bioactive compounds that several studies have proven have an antioxidant effect, and therefore are beneficial for food and pharmaceutical companies [<xref rid="B16-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The oils from citrus cultivars such as <italic>Citrus grandis, Citrus sinensis, Citrus paradisi, Citrus reticulata, Citrus limon, and Citrus aurantium</italic> have been shown to have strong activity against <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> under laboratory conditions [<xref rid="B19-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These oils have secondary metabolites, which help plants deter insect pests [<xref rid="B23-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, due to its insecticidal properties, it is worthwhile investigating pomelo peel for managing vector mosquitoes.</p><p>In this study, pomelo peel oil was selected and subjected to a microencapsulation technique in order to produce a microencapsulated <italic>Citrus grandis</italic> essential oil (CGEO)-based repellent. The stability and efficacy testing for different storage conditions, i.e., short (1 month), accelerated (6 months), and long term (12 months) were conducted accordingly, and then compared to a non-encapsulated CGEO-based repellent formulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-molecules-26-03599"><title>2.

Discussion</title><p>Recently, there are many topical mosquito repellents on the market that are available in many forms, i.e., sprays, creams, lotions, aerosols, oils, evaporators, patches, and canisters. Despite the remarkable advancement in insect repellent research, the menace of vector-borne diseases is yet to be effectively controlled and the main reason for this failure is poor user compliance with respect to using the marketed repellents [<xref rid="B6-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For example, topical repellents need to be reapplied frequently, which results in an inconsistent amenability and inaccurate application. Thus, they are considered to be unreliable vector control tools [<xref rid="B24-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Therefore, the design and development of topical repellent formulations, is an approach that can be explored to overcome this problem and enhance user compliance and acceptability.</p><p>In this study, a plant-based essential oil was successfully encapsulated by using an interfacial precipitation technique as described in the literature [<xref rid="B25-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. As such, no phase separation was shown by the formulation right after its preparation, indicating effective homogenization of the aqueous and oil phases and successful emulsification [<xref rid="B28-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Furthermore, the organoleptic characteristics suggested that both formulations fulfilled the criteria in sensorial quality, which included a non-greasy feeling, light texture, spreadability, and pleasant feeling and aroma. Such sensorial qualities also play an important role in determining consumer compliance. Cheng et al. (2009) [<xref rid="B28-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], in their study, reported that most consumers express dislike for a product that is not smooth and emits a greasy feeling.</p><p>During storage, environmental factors such as temperature and humidity can lead to destabilization of a formulation&#x02019;s physical characteristics, subsequently affecting its efficacy and safety [<xref rid="B14-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Therefore, suitable storage conditions are crucial to minimize environmental effects on the formulation. However, another factor to consider when determining formulation stability is, namely, the type of formulation [<xref rid="B28-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This study suggested that different formulations demonstrated different physical stabilities during storage.</p><p>A centrifugation test can provide fast information regarding the emulsion stability properties of a formulation. An emulsion is unstable when phase separation occurs after centrifugation [<xref rid="B29-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In the present study, we demonstrated that throughout 12 months of storage, both formulations presented no phase separation when stored under the 25 &#x000b0;C storage condition as compared with the 40 &#x000b0;C storage condition, indicating that stability of the formulation was maintained under the 25 &#x000b0;C storage condition Moreover, the organoleptic assays demonstrated that, under the 25 &#x000b0;C storage condition, both formulations presented no changes in their physical appearance over 12 months of storage. However, under the 40 &#x000b0;C storage condition, both formulations demonstrated changes in terms of their physical appearance after six months of storage. This was consistent with the centrifugation study outcomes, whereby the physical instability of the emulsion system was observed after six months of storage when stored under the 40 &#x000b0;C storage condition. Therefore, a reduction in the physical stability of the emulsion system causes phase separation and can also lead to changes in the appearance, consistency, spreadability, and performance of a formulation [<xref rid="B30-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, this study demonstrated that, under the 25 &#x000b0;C storage condition, the microencapsulated formulation presented no significant reduction in particle size over 12 months of storage (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). The non-encapsulated formulation, however, presented a significant upsurge in particle size after 3 months of storage (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), suggesting that encapsulation helped to retain particle size when stored under the 25 &#x000b0;C storage condition. In addition, this study revealed that both formulations presented contrary trends in particle size during the 12 months of storage. This finding parallels a previous study that reported that the particle size of microencapsulated DEET showed a declining trend after 3 months of storage [<xref rid="B26-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The reduction was attributed to the release of DEET within the microcapsule into the continuous phase, thus decreasing particle size [<xref rid="B26-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. A similar mechanism may be involved for microencapsulated formulation in this study. Contrastingly, the non-encapsulated formulation showed an increase in particle size indicative of coalescence between the particles. This finding is similar to a previous study that found an increased particle size during the study period due to the coalescence phenomenon in a non-encapsulated formulation [<xref rid="B31-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Accordingly, exposure to higher temperature can cause an exaggeration of these mechanisms, which, if it continues, the dispersed phase separates and the emulsion breaks [<xref rid="B31-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In this study, under the 40 &#x000b0;C storage condition, both formulations showed significant changes in their particle sizes while the phase separation was observed at the end of the study period.</p><p>Similarly, the zeta potential measurement provides the charge on a particle surface. On the one hand, high values, whether negative or positive, lead to repulsive forces between particles, which improve the repellency between particles, thus inhibiting aggregations [<xref rid="B33-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. On the other hand, low potential values indicate the absence of repulsive interaction and result in particle aggregation and instability of the emulsion system [<xref rid="B33-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Right after the preparation, the microencapsulated formulation demonstrated high stability (&#x02212;45 mV), while a moderate stability (&#x02212;30 mV) was seen for the non-encapsulated formulation. During storage under the 25 &#x000b0;C condition, the microencapsulated formulation showed no significant changes in its zeta potential value over 12 months of storage, while the non-encapsulated formulation presented a significant reduction after 6 months of storage. These results are in line with the theory regarding zeta potential value, i.e., in the case of microencapsulated formulations, high zeta potential values provide strong repulsive forces between particles, preventing aggregations and allowing the emulsion system to be stable. On the contrary, non-encapsulated formulations with low zeta potential values cause low repulsive forces and lead to particle aggregation and instability of the emulsion system [<xref rid="B33-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Under the 40 &#x000b0;C storage condition, 6 and 12 months of storage resulted in instability of both formulations, i.e., the microencapsulated formulation demonstrated agglomeration, whereas the non-encapsulated formulation indicated precipitation and phase separation occurred. Temperature is one of the factors that can affect zeta potential values. Here, exposure to high temperatures decreased the repulsive forces between particles, which then encouraged aggregation and caused the emulsion system to become unstable [<xref rid="B32-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B34-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Other than temperature, the pH of an emulsion also contributes to changes in the zeta potential value, i.e., the zeta potential value decreases with a reduction in pH. The results obtained from the pH assay in this study were consistent with this. As mentioned in previous studies, a reduction in zeta potential charge on the particles can be observed when the pH value is decreased [<xref rid="B35-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Alterations in pH values can cause a formulation to become incompatible with the skin and may cause skin irritation [<xref rid="B29-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]; therefore, it is important to detect any pH alterations during storage. The results from the stability study indicated that although the pH was shown to reduce for both formulations over 12 months of storage under the 25 &#x000b0;C storage condition, the change was within the range of pH values of 5.0 to 5.5. Therefore, this range is still suitable for topical application [<xref rid="B36-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Regardless, the decreasing pH values in both formulations may be due to the presence of free essential oil in the emulsion system following essential oil release from the microcapsule in terms of the microencapsulated formulation. Otherwise, it may be due to the particle breakdown in the non-encapsulated formulation. Under the 40 &#x000b0;C storage condition, the pH value was below 5.0 (acidic state), and therefore was likely unsuitable for topical application.</p><p>The data regarding the repellent activity showed that both formulations demonstrated a reduction in such activity throughout the study period. However, the microencapsulated formulation was considered to be better than the non-encapsulated formulation as it possessed repellent activity that was maintained up to 6 months of storage as compared with the non-encapsulated formulation&#x02019;s 3 months of storage. The superior repellent activity is possibly due to the wall surrounding the particle, which allows the slow release of essential oil into the environment upon application of the formulation on the skin. Microencapsulation also yields protection for EOs against oxidation when exposed to the environment and chemical interactions with other chemicals inside the formulation, thereby improving their functional activity as a repellent. Accordingly, these features also help to maintain the emulsion stability of the formulation, which is consistent with the results obtained from stability testing. The testing demonstrated that the microencapsulated formulation showed better stability as compared with the non-encapsulated formulation across a similar storage condition and time of storage.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-molecules-26-03599"><title>4.

The extracted oil was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate to dry the oil before being stored in an airtight bottle and kept at 4 &#x000b0;C for further use.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot3-molecules-26-03599"><title>4.3. Encapsulation Procedure</title><p>CGEO was encapsulated by using interfacial precipitation chemistry to form a polysaccharide film around the dispersal droplet [<xref rid="B25-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Briefly, the microcapsule walls were formed in two steps by reacting to the amphiphilic macromolecule CMC with a complementary reactant BKC. The first step was the formation of emulsions containing droplets of core material (i.e., CGEO) in the first wall-forming reactant solution (i.e., CMC) that preferentially accumulated at the droplet surface by polar solvent forces. The second step was the addition of the second wall forming reactant (i.e., BKC) to the system and spontaneously precipitating the CMC to form a membrane-like wall surrounding each droplet.</p><p>For this study, the microencapsulation of CGEO involved several phases as follows: Phase A was the amalgamation of CGEO with an adjuvant to form a core phase consisting of 60% active ingredient and 40% adjuvant. Dow Corning 200 (silicon oil) and vanillin were mixed and blended in a 200 mL beaker using a magnetic stirrer bar set to rotate at a minimal speed of 200 rpm at 60 &#x000b0;C. Then, the solution was allowed to cool to 45 &#x000b0;C before the active ingredient was added to the mixture. Stirring was continued to complete the process. In another beaker, all ingredients for Phase B (i.e., Cetyl alcohol, PEG 3350, Span 80, and Tween 60) were heated to melting point (60 &#x000b0;C) and stirred to mix completely. Then, the Phase A mixture was slowly added into the Phase B mixture and stirring was continued to form an emulsion, thereby referred to as the core emulsion mixture.</p><p>Phase C was the aqueous solution of the first wall-forming reactant, which was combined with distilled water to make a 1% solution and mixed using a 40 mm diameter four-bladed propeller at 600 rpm and 45 &#x000b0;C. Then, the core emulsion mixture was dispersed into the Phase C solution at the same rotation speed and temperature. Stirring was maintained for 1 h to produce a uniform oil-in-water dispersion (Phase E). Meanwhile, the Phase D mixture consisted of the second wall-forming reactant (i.e., BKC) and distilled water, which was gradually added to the Phase E emulsion. Concurrently, the stirrer speed was slowly increased to 800 rpm in order to achieve the formation of a microcapsule wall. Then, this mixture was removed from heating after 120 s and allowed to cool to ambient temperature by stirring to complete the reaction, resulting in a semisolid microcapsule within the aqueous solution. Next, the resulting mixture was transferred into a container with a secured screw cap after an ambient temperature was achieved.

Conclusions</title><p>Marked encapsulation application in plant-based repellent product development helped to improve the stability and efficacy of the formulation, which were successfully observed in this study. Although both formulations presented stability when stored under 25 &#x000b1; 2 &#x000b0;C/60% &#x000b1; 5% RH condition, the microencapsulated formulation appeared to demonstrate an excellent ability to retain its physical stability and efficacy over 12 months of storage as compared with the non-encapsulated formulation. However, the microencapsulated formulation also seemed to share similar stability characteristics with the non-encapsulated formulation under the 40 &#x000b1; 2 &#x000b0;C/70% &#x000b1; 5% RH storage condition, whereby both formulations presented instability in their respective emulsion systems. Therefore, this suggests that a microencapsulation formulation cannot maintain its physical stability against high temperature, especially when continuously exposed over a long period of time. More investigation on the improvement of the formulation technique for examples by using different encapsulation materials or a higher ratio of CMC is necessary to improve the stability at high temperature.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank the Malaysia Ministry of Higher Education (grant number: FRGS/1/2019/STG05/UPM/02/12) and University Malaya (grant number: PG085-2012B) for awarding the research grants and the Institute of Medical Research Malaysia (IMR) for providing support with the mosquitoes and cages.
