<p>According to the stability study, the 25 Â°C storage condition was observed to be the most suitable condition for maintaining the stability of the formulations. Therefore, the formulations stored under this condition were tested for their repellent effects to ensure the effectiveness during storage. The trends of protection time over 12 months for microencapsulated and non-encapsulated formulations are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03599-f004">Figure 4</xref>. Both formulations showed similar efficacy levels right after the preparation, i.e., providing up to 2 h of complete protection (100%), &gt;80% at 6 h, and &gt;60% at 8 h post application, accordingly. After 6 months of storage, the microencapsulated formulation was able to maintain this efficacy level (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03599-f004">Figure 4</xref>a), while the non-encapsulated formulation yielded a reduction in protection time after 3 months of storage. For the latter formulation, a complete protection time was observed at 1 h, high protection at 2 h, and moderate protection at 8 h post application (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03599-f004">Figure 4</xref>b). After 9 months of storage, the microencapsulated formulation showed complete protection for 1 h post application (
