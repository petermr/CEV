<p>Right after its preparation, an average particle size (Z-average) of the microencapsulated formulation was 3.29 µm, while the non-encapsulated formulation was 0.21 µm. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03599-f001">Figure 1</xref> shows the changes in particle size for the microencapsulated formulation (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03599-f001">Figure 1</xref>b) during the study period in different storage conditions. Under the 25 °C storage condition, the average particle size of the microencapsulated formulation showed stability during the first three months. However, after 3 to 12 months of storage, particle sizes were reduced by 17.9%, whereas under the 40 °C storage condition, particle sizes showed a 68.7% reduction after 1 month of storage. In contrast, the non-encapsulated formulation average particle size showed an opposite trend, i.e., 72% and 92.7% reduction when stored at 25 °C and 40 °C storage conditions, respectively.
