 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03599-f002">Figure 2</xref> shows the zeta potential variation of both formulations stored at 25 °C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03599-f002">Figure 2</xref>a) and 40 °C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03599-f002">Figure 2</xref>b). Right after the preparation, the microencapsulated formulation demonstrated high stability (−45 mV), while the non-encapsulated formulation demonstrated moderate stability (−30 mV). Under the 25 °C storage condition, both formulations showed no significant changes in the average zeta potential values during the short and accelerated terms of storage (

However, after 6 months of storage, the microencapsulated formulation showed a 9% reduction in the average zeta potential value, while the non-encapsulated formulation showed a 20% reduction. Moreover, after 12 months of storage, the microencapsulated formulation presented high stability (−41 mV), whereas the non-encapsulated formulation demonstrated a slight dispersion (−23 mV) in their emulsion system (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03599-f002">Figure 2</xref>a). Under the 40 °C storage condition, the microencapsulated formulation demonstrated agglomeration (−15 mV), while the non-encapsulated formulation indicated precipitation and phase separation (−5 mV) in the emulsion system after 12 months of storage (
