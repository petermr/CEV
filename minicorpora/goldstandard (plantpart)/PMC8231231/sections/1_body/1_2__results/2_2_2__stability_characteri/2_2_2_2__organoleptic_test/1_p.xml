<p>In the organoleptic study, it was observed that all formulations showed no change in appearance, color, smell, and texture during the short-term, accelerated, or long-term storage when stored under 25 °C storage conditions. Sediment, crystallization, and phase separation were also absent (data not shown). Upon skin application, no residue was detected and an insignificant change in spreadability was observed during these periods. However, under the 40 °C storage condition, both formulations showed a slight change in their color (i.e., yellowish), produced a strong odor, presented phase separation, and became very light in texture after 6 months of storage. Furthermore, 12 months of storage caused the formulations to turn slightly darker in color and to release an irritating odor. Phase separation was further observed, a change in spreadability (very light) was noted, and an oily feeling upon application on the skin was also detected.</p>
