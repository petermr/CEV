<p>Alterations in pH values can cause a formulation to become incompatible with the skin and may cause skin irritation [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]; therefore, it is important to detect any pH alterations during storage. The results from the stability study indicated that although the pH was shown to reduce for both formulations over 12 months of storage under the 25 °C storage condition, the change was within the range of pH values of 5.0 to 5.5. Therefore, this range is still suitable for topical application [

Regardless, the decreasing pH values in both formulations may be due to the presence of free essential oil in the emulsion system following essential oil release from the microcapsule in terms of the microencapsulated formulation. Otherwise, it may be due to the particle breakdown in the non-encapsulated formulation. Under the 40 °C storage condition, the pH value was below 5.0 (acidic state), and therefore was likely unsuitable for topical application.
