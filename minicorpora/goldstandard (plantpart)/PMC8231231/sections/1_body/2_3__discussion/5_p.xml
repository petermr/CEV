<p>Moreover, this study demonstrated that, under the 25 °C storage condition, the microencapsulated formulation presented no significant reduction in particle size over 12 months of storage (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). The non-encapsulated formulation, however, presented a significant upsurge in particle size after 3 months of storage (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), suggesting that encapsulation helped to retain particle size when stored under the 25 °C storage condition. In addition, this study revealed that both formulations presented contrary trends in particle size during the 12 months of storage. This finding parallels a previous study that reported that the particle size of microencapsulated DEET showed a declining trend after 3 months of storage [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The reduction was attributed to the release of DEET within the microcapsule into the continuous phase, thus decreasing particle size [

Contrastingly, the non-encapsulated formulation showed an increase in particle size indicative of coalescence between the particles. This finding is similar to a previous study that found an increased particle size during the study period due to the coalescence phenomenon in a non-encapsulated formulation [

 <xref rid="B32-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Accordingly, exposure to higher temperature can cause an exaggeration of these mechanisms, which, if it continues, the dispersed phase separates and the emulsion breaks [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In this study, under the 40 °C storage condition, both formulations showed significant changes in their particle sizes while the phase separation was observed at the end of the study period.
