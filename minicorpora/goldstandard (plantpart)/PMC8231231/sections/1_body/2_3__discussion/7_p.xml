<p>Under the 40 Â°C storage condition, 6 and 12 months of storage resulted in instability of both formulations, i.e., the microencapsulated formulation demonstrated agglomeration, whereas the non-encapsulated formulation indicated precipitation and phase separation occurred. Temperature is one of the factors that can affect zeta potential values. Here, exposure to high temperatures decreased the repulsive forces between particles, which then encouraged aggregation and caused the emulsion system to become unstable [

Other than temperature, the pH of an emulsion also contributes to changes in the zeta potential value, i.e., the zeta potential value decreases with a reduction in pH. The results obtained from the pH assay in this study were consistent with this. As mentioned in previous studies, a reduction in zeta potential charge on the particles can be observed when the pH value is decreased [
