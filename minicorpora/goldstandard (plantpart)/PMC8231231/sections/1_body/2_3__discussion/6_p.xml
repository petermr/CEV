<p>Similarly, the zeta potential measurement provides the charge on a particle surface. On the one hand, high values, whether negative or positive, lead to repulsive forces between particles, which improve the repellency between particles, thus inhibiting aggregations [

Right after the preparation, the microencapsulated formulation demonstrated high stability (−45 mV), while a moderate stability (−30 mV) was seen for the non-encapsulated formulation. During storage under the 25 °C condition, the microencapsulated formulation showed no significant changes in its zeta potential value over 12 months of storage, while the non-encapsulated formulation presented a significant reduction after 6 months of storage. These results are in line with the theory regarding zeta potential value, i.e., in the case of microencapsulated formulations, high zeta potential values provide strong repulsive forces between particles, preventing aggregations and allowing the emulsion system to be stable. On the contrary, non-encapsulated formulations with low zeta potential values cause low repulsive forces and lead to particle aggregation and instability of the emulsion system [
