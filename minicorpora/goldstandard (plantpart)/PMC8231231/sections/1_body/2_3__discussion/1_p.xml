<p>Recently, there are many topical mosquito repellents on the market that are available in many forms, i.e., sprays, creams, lotions, aerosols, oils, evaporators, patches, and canisters. Despite the remarkable advancement in insect repellent research, the menace of vector-borne diseases is yet to be effectively controlled and the main reason for this failure is poor user compliance with respect to using the marketed repellents [
