<p>The data regarding the repellent activity showed that both formulations demonstrated a reduction in such activity throughout the study period. However, the microencapsulated formulation was considered to be better than the non-encapsulated formulation as it possessed repellent activity that was maintained up to 6 months of storage as compared with the non-encapsulated formulationâ€™s 3 months of storage. The superior repellent activity is possibly due to the wall surrounding the particle, which allows the slow release of essential oil into the environment upon application of the formulation on the skin. Microencapsulation also yields protection for EOs against oxidation when exposed to the environment and chemical interactions with other chemicals inside the formulation, thereby improving their functional activity as a repellent. Accordingly, these features also help to maintain the emulsion stability of the formulation, which is consistent with the results obtained from stability testing. The testing demonstrated that the microencapsulated formulation showed better stability as compared with the non-encapsulated formulation across a similar storage condition and time of storage.</p>
