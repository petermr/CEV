Furthermore, the organoleptic characteristics suggested that both formulations fulfilled the criteria in sensorial quality, which included a non-greasy feeling, light texture, spreadability, and pleasant feeling and aroma. Such sensorial qualities also play an important role in determining consumer compliance. Cheng et al. (2009) [
