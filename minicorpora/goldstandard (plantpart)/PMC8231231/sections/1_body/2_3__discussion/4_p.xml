<p>A centrifugation test can provide fast information regarding the emulsion stability properties of a formulation. An emulsion is unstable when phase separation occurs after centrifugation [

In the present study, we demonstrated that throughout 12 months of storage, both formulations presented no phase separation when stored under the 25 °C storage condition as compared with the 40 °C storage condition, indicating that stability of the formulation was maintained under the 25 °C storage condition Moreover, the organoleptic assays demonstrated that, under the 25 °C storage condition, both formulations presented no changes in their physical appearance over 12 months of storage. However, under the 40 °C storage condition, both formulations demonstrated changes in terms of their physical appearance after six months of storage. This was consistent with the centrifugation study outcomes, whereby the physical instability of the emulsion system was observed after six months of storage when stored under the 40 °C storage condition. Therefore, a reduction in the physical stability of the emulsion system causes phase separation and can also lead to changes in the appearance, consistency, spreadability, and performance of a formulation [
