<p>The microencapsulated CGEO was formulated into a lotion base to produce a cosmetic repellent product. Emulsifying wax NF, stearic acid, shea butter, cocoa butter, coconut oil, sweet almond oil, and jojoba oil were mixed using a propeller at 400 rpm and heated at 70 °C. Then, the mixture was allowed to cool to 45 °C before glycerine, aloe vera gel, and a microencapsulated CGEO were added, while continuously stirring until a uniform mixture was produced. For the non-encapsulated formulation, a similar procedure was done in which 20% of CGEO oil was added into the mixture to replace the microencapsulated CGEO.</p>
