<p>CGEO was encapsulated by using interfacial precipitation chemistry to form a polysaccharide film around the dispersal droplet [

Briefly, the microcapsule walls were formed in two steps by reacting to the amphiphilic macromolecule CMC with a complementary reactant BKC. The first step was the formation of emulsions containing droplets of core material (i.e., CGEO) in the first wall-forming reactant solution (i.e., CMC) that preferentially accumulated at the droplet surface by polar solvent forces. The second step was the addition of the second wall forming reactant (i.e., BKC) to the system and spontaneously precipitating the CMC to form a membrane-like wall surrounding each droplet.
