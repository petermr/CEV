<p>For this study, the microencapsulation of CGEO involved several phases as follows: Phase A was the amalgamation of CGEO with an adjuvant to form a core phase consisting of 60% active ingredient and 40% adjuvant. Dow Corning 200 (silicon oil) and vanillin were mixed and blended in a 200 mL beaker using a magnetic stirrer bar set to rotate at a minimal speed of 200 rpm at 60 °C. Then, the solution was allowed to cool to 45 °C before the active ingredient was added to the mixture. Stirring was continued to complete the process. In another beaker, all ingredients for Phase B (i.e., Cetyl alcohol, PEG 3350, Span 80, and Tween 60) were heated to melting point (60 °C) and stirred to mix completely. Then, the Phase A mixture was slowly added into the Phase B mixture and stirring was continued to form an emulsion, thereby referred to as the core emulsion mixture.</p>
