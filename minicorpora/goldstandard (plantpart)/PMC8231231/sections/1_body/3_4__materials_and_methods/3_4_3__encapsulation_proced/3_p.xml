<p>Phase C was the aqueous solution of the first wall-forming reactant, which was combined with distilled water to make a 1% solution and mixed using a 40 mm diameter four-bladed propeller at 600 rpm and 45 Â°C. Then, the core emulsion mixture was dispersed into the Phase C solution at the same rotation speed and temperature. Stirring was maintained for 1 h to produce a uniform oil-in-water dispersion (Phase E). Meanwhile, the Phase D mixture consisted of the second wall-forming reactant (i.e., BKC) and distilled water, which was gradually added to the Phase E emulsion. Concurrently, the stirrer speed was slowly increased to 800 rpm in order to achieve the formation of a microcapsule wall. Then, this mixture was removed from heating after 120 s and allowed to cool to ambient temperature by stirring to complete the reaction, resulting in a semisolid microcapsule within the aqueous solution. Next, the resulting mixture was transferred into a container with a secured screw cap after an ambient temperature was achieved. In summary,
