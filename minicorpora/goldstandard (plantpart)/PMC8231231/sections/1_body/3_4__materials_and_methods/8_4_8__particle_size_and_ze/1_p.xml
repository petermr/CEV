<p>First, 20 mg of samples were dispersed in 50 mL of deionized water and sonicated at 25 °C for 15 min. Then, the solutions were transferred into a folded capillary cell (i.e., polycarbonate with gold-plated electrodes) to test for the particle size and zeta potential using a Zetasizer Nano (Malvern Instrument Ltd., Worcestershire, the United Kingdom) at 25 °C. The mean particle diameter was calculated using the differential size distribution processor (SDP) intensity analysis program. The zeta potential values were graded according to the Morrison and Ross 2002 [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] guideline, i.e., values from ±60 to ±40 mV indicate high stability, ±40 to ±30 mV indicate moderate stability, ±30 to ±15 mV indicate light dispersion, and ±15 to ±10 mV indicate agglomeration.
