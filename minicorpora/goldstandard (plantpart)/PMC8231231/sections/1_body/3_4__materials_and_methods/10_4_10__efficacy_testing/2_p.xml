<p>A fresh batch of 25 female 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes was introduced into each compartment through the circular opening. Two 25 cm
 <sup>2</sup> areas were drawn on top of the hands of the human volunteers. One area was untreated (control) while the other was pretreated with 0.4 g of a test formulation. Before treatment, both hands were covered with rubber gloves that had a 25 cm
 <sup>2</sup> opening up to the wrist level to confine the mosquito bites to the exposed areas only. Both hands were exposed simultaneously in a cage for three min and the number of mosquito bites was recorded. The assessment periods were set at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h post application. The effectiveness of the formulations was based on the percent reduction in mosquito bites on the treated arms as compared with the untreated arms (control) using the following formula:
 <disp-formula>% protection reduction = [(C − T)/C] × 100,
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where 
 <italic>C</italic> is the total number of mosquito bites on the control and 
 <italic>T</italic> is the total number of mosquito bites on the treated arms. Each lotion formulation was tested on five human volunteers for three iterations.
