<p>Stability testing was carried out to evaluate the formulation stability under the influence of various environmental factors with time. The storage conditions and testing frequency of the final products were performed by following the WHO guidelines for stability study of pharmaceutical products [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The microencapsulated and non-encapsulated formulations were packaged accordingly in impermeable polypropylene containers and stored under different conditions, namely controlled room temperature (25 ± 2 °C/60% ± 5% RH) and 40 ± 2 °C/75 ± 5% RH. After 1 month (short-term), 6 months (accelerated term), and 12 months (long-term) of storage, these formulations were evaluated for their stability.
