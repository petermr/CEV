 <italic>Citrus grandis</italic> (L.) Osbeck, commonly known as pomelo or ”Limau Bali” is one of the species in the family of Zingiberaceae, which is widely distributed throughout the tropics, particularly in Southeast Asia. It is round in shape, greenish in color, 15–25 cm in diameter, and usually weighs about 1–2 kg [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The Department of Agriculture of Malaysia reported that pomelo production in Malaysia increased significantly from 1960 to 2014. Approximately 1009 ha of land had been used for pomelo plantations that produced 11,830.6 metric tons per year. Pomelo is usually consumed fresh or used for flavoring by the food and beverage industries. Meanwhile, their peel is discarded as waste. Since 30% of pomelo weight is derived from its peel, this reflects around 1956 metric tons (9.4 billion Ringgit Malaysia/USD 2.4 million) of pomelo peel being discarded per year in 2014 [

Pomelo peel is composed of various bioactive compounds that several studies have proven have an antioxidant effect, and therefore are beneficial for food and pharmaceutical companies [
