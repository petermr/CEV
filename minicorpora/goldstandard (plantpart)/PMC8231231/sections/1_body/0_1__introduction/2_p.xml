<p>For decades, thousands of plants have been screened as potential sources of repellent and insecticides. However, only a few plants have been registered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA). Citronella, lemon, and eucalyptus oils are among the natural ingredients that have obtained approval due to their relatively low toxicity and acceptable efficacy, and therefore are often selected by many manufacturers as the ingredients in their plant-based repellents [

Unfortunately, although these products are preferred over synthetic products, the majority of them have been shown to have a short protection time of less than two hours as compared with synthetic repellents that mostly possess up to four hours of protection [
