<p>Botanical insecticides, therefore, must be rigorously improved to achieve an acceptable level of effectiveness if they are to compete against synthetic insecticides [

 <xref rid="B11-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Several techniques and methods in the formulation process have been developed in recent years to improve the stability of botanical extracts and essential oils. Microencapsulation, in particular, is one of the techniques used to protect the essential oils that can simply undergo degradation [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-26-03599" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This technique involves the production of an outer coating (i.e., wall) that surrounds the particles of an essential oil (i.e., core) by using a polymer (i.e., synthetic or natural). The wall protects the unstable core material from the environment and can further control its volatility, subsequently extending the release rate of the essential oil and improving product effectiveness [
