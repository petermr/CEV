<p>The preparation technique used is not the only factor that influences the effectiveness of a repellent product; the stability of its formulation is also an important component that determines the effectiveness of a product [

Therefore, identifying a preparation technique that improves or maintains the stability of a formulation during storage is an important objective of among studies. During the development of a repellent product, it is necessary to determine suitable storage conditions that can preserve the product’s obtained stability. For example, an unsuitable temperature can change the product’s physical stability and lead to a destabilization effect on the formulation, which directly affects the product’s quality, efficacy, and safety [

Moreover, the droplet size, polydispersity index, pH, and viscosity are among the important characteristics for determining the stability of the formulation. Accordingly, different preparation techniques produce varying characteristics.
