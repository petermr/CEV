<p>In this study, pomelo peel oil was selected and subjected to a microencapsulation technique in order to produce a microencapsulated 
 <italic>Citrus grandis</italic> essential oil (CGEO)-based repellent. The stability and efficacy testing for different storage conditions, i.e., short (1 month), accelerated (6 months), and long term (12 months) were conducted accordingly, and then compared to a non-encapsulated CGEO-based repellent formulation.
