<p>Marked encapsulation application in plant-based repellent product development helped to improve the stability and efficacy of the formulation, which were successfully observed in this study. Although both formulations presented stability when stored under 25 ± 2 °C/60% ± 5% RH condition, the microencapsulated formulation appeared to demonstrate an excellent ability to retain its physical stability and efficacy over 12 months of storage as compared with the non-encapsulated formulation. However, the microencapsulated formulation also seemed to share similar stability characteristics with the non-encapsulated formulation under the 40 ± 2 °C/70% ± 5% RH storage condition, whereby both formulations presented instability in their respective emulsion systems. Therefore, this suggests that a microencapsulation formulation cannot maintain its physical stability against high temperature, especially when continuously exposed over a long period of time. More investigation on the improvement of the formulation technique for examples by using different encapsulation materials or a higher ratio of CMC is necessary to improve the stability at high temperature.</p>
