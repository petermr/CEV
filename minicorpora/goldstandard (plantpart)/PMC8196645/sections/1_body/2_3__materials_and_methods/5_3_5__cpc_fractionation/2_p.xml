<p>The experiments were performed on an FCPC Kromaton apparatus equipped with an analytical CPC column of 50 mL capacity (FCPC50
 <sup>®</sup>, Rousselet Robatel Kromaton, Annonay, France). For both analyses, the same protocol was followed. Initially, the column was filled with the upper stationary phase on descending mode at a flow rate of 8 mL/min and setting the rotation speed at 200 rpm. Then the rotation speed was increased to 800 rpm and the lower phase of the same system (mobile phase) was pumped at 5 mL/min on descending mode to equilibrate the two phases into the column (Sf was calculated at 0.58%). 500 μL of the essential oil were diluted in a mixture of the two phases (ratio 1:1 upper phase/lower phase) and injected via a 3-mL injection loop. Overall, a total of 35 fractions of 5 mL were collected using the lower phase as the mobile phase, and then the extrusion step was followed using the upper stationary phase as mobile phase resulting in the collection of 10 additional fractions of 5 mL. The rotation speed and flow rate were kept stable at 800 rpm and 5 mL/min, respectively, in descending mode, during the whole experiment.
