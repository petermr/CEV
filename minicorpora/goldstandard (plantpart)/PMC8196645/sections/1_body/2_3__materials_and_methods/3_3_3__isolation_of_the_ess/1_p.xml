A Clevenger apparatus was set on top, in order to collect the extracted essential oil. The protocol of the procedure was as follow: for the first two minutes we set the power at 1000 W, then for the next ten minutes the power was set at 700 W and for the last 15 min the power was set at 400 W. Overall, the procedure of the extraction lasted for 37 min. The oil was collected and dehydrated over anhydrous sodium sulfate to remove excess water and then weighted and stored in a vial at the freezer for further analysis.
