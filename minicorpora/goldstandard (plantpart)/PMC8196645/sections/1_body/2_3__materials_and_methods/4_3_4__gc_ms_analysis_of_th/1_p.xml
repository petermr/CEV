<p>Analyses of the essential oils and CPC fractions were performed on a Hewlett Packard 5973–6890 apparatus coupled to an HP 5973 mass spectrometer. The volatile compounds were separated in an HP-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm; film thickness of 0.25 μm Agilent Palo Alto, CA, USA.) using Helium as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The gas chromatograph oven temperature started at 60 °C and increased by 3 °C per minute until it reached 300 °C, where it remained for 10 min. The injected volume was 1 μL and the total analysis time for each sample lasted 90 min. The ion production method was an electron bombardment (EI-70 eV) while the identification of the compounds was based on a comparison of the obtained MS spectra with the mass spectra of the Wiley and NIST 2011 libraries and taking into account the elution order of the substances.</p>
