<p>For the in vivo determination of the repellent activity of the selected EOs and isolated compounds and mixtures, the evaluation was based on the number of mosquito landings on human skin at a dose equivalent to 0.2 μL/cm
 <sup>2</sup> diluted with dichloromethane (DCM) [

Control experiments with compound-free DCM solvent or DEET treatments (negative and positive controls, respectively) were also conducted. Each treatment was repeated 5–9 times on two human volunteers. Landing numbers were converted to repellence indices using the equation RI = [1 − T/C] × 100, where C was the number of landings in control and T the number of landings in treatment.
