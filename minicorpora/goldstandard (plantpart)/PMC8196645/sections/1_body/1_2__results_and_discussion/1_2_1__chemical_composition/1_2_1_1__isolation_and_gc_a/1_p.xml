<p>In the present work, five essential oils obtained from the wood of 
 <italic>P. nigra</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>nigra</italic> (PNI) and 
 <italic>P. heldreichii</italic> (PHE), needles of 
 <italic>P. pinea</italic> (PPI), and fruits of 
 <italic>J.</italic>
 <italic>turbinata</italic> (JTU) and 
 <italic>J. oxycedrus</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>deltoides</italic> (JOX) were studied. The isolation of the essential oils was carried out using Microwave-Assisted Hydrodistillation (MAHD), a ‘‘green’’ technique that is used both at the research and industrial level due to efficient heating, fast energy transfer, and environmental friendliness [
