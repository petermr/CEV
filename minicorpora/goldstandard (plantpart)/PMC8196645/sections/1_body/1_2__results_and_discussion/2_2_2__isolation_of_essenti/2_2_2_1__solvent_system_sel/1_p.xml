<p>The first and most important step for a successful CPC separation is the selection of the appropriate biphasic solvent system. The bibliographic research on the analysis of essential oils by countercurrent chromatography revealed the presence of a limited number of specific scientific papers. The majority of the essential oils were fractionated using non-aqueous biphasic systems, which is justified by the strong hydrophobicity of their volatile constituents. Following the same approach, we created and tested several non-aqueous biphasic systems consisting of the solvents petroleum ether, heptane, acetonitrile, acetone and butanol in various combinations and proportions. The initial TLC tests of these systems revealed that the biphasic system Heptane/Acetonitrile/Butanol in the solvent ratio of 1.6/1.6/0.2
