<p>The CPC experiment was performed on an analytical column of 50 mL (FCPC50
 <sup>Â®</sup>) using the elution extrusion method in descending mode. The analysis started by establishing the hydrodynamic equilibrium of the two phases into the column (Sf = 58%). After sample injection (500 mg for each EO) the separation of the volatile compounds was achieved by initially passing 175 mL of the lower phase as a mobile phase (elution step), and then the column content was extruded using, as a mobile phase, the upper phase of the biphasic system in descending mode (extrusion step). The flow rate and rotation speed were set at 5 mL/min and 800 rpm, respectively, during the entire procedure, while the fraction collector was set to collect fractions every 1 min, resulting in a total of 45 fractions (of 5 mL) (see
