<p>The GC-MS analysis of CPC fractions verified the elution order of the target compounds witch was calculated based on the K
 <sub>D</sub> values. 
 <italic>β</italic>-Myrcene was eluted first, and collected on fractions 17–26, 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene on fractions 26–36, while germacrene D was eluted during the extrusion step and collected in fractions 34–41. Regarding the purity of the isolated compounds, 
 <italic>β</italic>-myrcene was recovered with high purity (&gt;95%), germacrene D wiith a purity of approximately 85% (on fractions 37–40) while 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene was collected in mixture with its isomer 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03072-f001">Figure 1</xref>) in the fractions 26–30, almost in a pure form in the next three fractions (31–33) and in a mixture with germacrene D in the last fractions of its elution (34–36).
