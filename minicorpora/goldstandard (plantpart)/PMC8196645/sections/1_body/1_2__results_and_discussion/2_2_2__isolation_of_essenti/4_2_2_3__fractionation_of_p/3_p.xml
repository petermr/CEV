<p>It is important to note that the CPC analysis of both EOs of 
 <italic>J. oxisedrus</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>deltoides</italic> fruits and 
 <italic>P. pinea</italic> needles are presented here for the first time. The analysis of CPC fractions presents a successful fractionation of both EOs in a short time (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-03072">Figure S3: supplementary material</xref>) leading to the recovery of the major compounds in pure form or in enriched fractions. Taking into account that countercurrent chromatography offers the advantage of ideal scaling-up from analytical to preparative and pilot processes [
