<p>Guaiol was the first of the target compounds that was eluted and collected in fractions 12–15. Based on GC-MS analysis, the purity of the isolated guaiol was found to be more than 80% (

 <italic>α</italic>-pinene as the major compound, together with its isomer, 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene. The ratios of the two compounds varied between the fractions starting from 70/30 in fraction 33–90/10 in fraction 36. This phenomenon was also observed during the fractionation of JOX EO and is justified from the similar distributions of these isomers in the two phases of the biphasic system. The last compound obtained from this analysis was 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene, which was eluded during the extrusion step and recovered on fractions 39–43. The purity of this sesquiterpene was found to be approximately 70% (
