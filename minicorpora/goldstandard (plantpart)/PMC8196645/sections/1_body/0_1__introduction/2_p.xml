 <xref rid="B12-molecules-26-03072" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Essential oils derived from plants and their major component terpenes, can be environmentally-friendly, have a low-risk profile for mammals and humans and might provide natural alternatives instead of using conventional insecticides [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-03072" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Particularly for repellents, there is an effort to develop products less harmful for humans and the environment. Therefore, the research on natural products with strong bioactivity, such as essential oils, has been prioritized [
