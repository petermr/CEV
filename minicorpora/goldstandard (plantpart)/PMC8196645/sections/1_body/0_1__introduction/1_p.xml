<p>Mosquitoes are responsible for spreading viruses, causing serious diseases such as malaria, filariasis, Japanese encephalitis, dengue fever and yellow fever. They cause the mortality of two million people every year and at least one million children die of diseases caused by mosquitoes [

 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>, an invasive mosquito species, was spread in many countries worldwide, mainly due to the trade of used tires [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-26-03072" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This mosquito species, also known as the Asian tiger mosquito, is responsible for the transmission of many human pathogens such as dengue, chikungunya, the Zika virus and filarial nematodes (
 <italic>Dilofilaria</italic> spp.). The protection from mosquito bites still remains the most effective way to prevent infections associated with those pathogens. The control of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> is very difficult and requires a concrete management plan which includes coordinated actions [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-03072" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The lack of understanding of the proper integrated management of those arthropods makes the implemented measures ineffective. Consequently, personal protective measures against mosquito bites, such as the use of repellents, is necessary to protect from nuisance and/or to prevent the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases.
