<p>In the present study, a separation method based on Centrifugal Partition Chromatography (CPC) was developed, aiming at the bio-guided isolation of volatile components with repellent activity against 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. Initially, five essential oils (EOs) obtained from 
 <italic>Pinus</italic> and 
 <italic>Juniperus</italic> species have been analyzed in terms of their chemical content and evaluated as repellant agents against the Asian tiger mosquito (
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>). Taking into account the chemical composition and repellent activity of the EOs, the next step of the study was focused on the isolation of the main volatile compounds from the needles of 
 <italic>P. pinea</italic> and fruits 
 <italic>J. oxycedrus</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>deltoides</italic>. The analyses were performed using the elutionâ€“extrusion CPC method with a non-aqueous biphasic system and resulted in effective recovery of the target compounds. All isolated compounds were tested for their repellent activity and important results have emerged.
