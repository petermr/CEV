 <p>The present work describes the use of Centrifugal Partition Chromatography (CPC) for the bio-guided isolation of repellent active volatile compounds from essential oils. Five essential oils (EOs) obtained from three 
  <italic>Pinus</italic> and two 
  <italic>Juniperus</italic> species were initially analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and evaluated for their repellent properties against 
  <italic>Aedes albopictus.</italic> The essential oil from needles of 
  <italic>P. pinea</italic> (PPI) presented the higher activity, showing 82.4% repellency at a dose of 0.2 μL/cm
  <sup>2</sup>. The above EO, together with the EO from the fruits of 
  <italic>J. oxycedrus</italic> subsp. 
  <italic>deltoides</italic> (JOX), were further analyzed by CPC using the biphasic system n-Heptane/ACN/BuOH in ratio 1.6/1.6/0.2 (
  <italic>v/v/v</italic>). The analysis of PPI essential oil resulted in the recovery of (−)-limonene, guaiol and simple mixtures of (−)-limonene/
  <italic>β</italic>-pheladrene, while the fractionation of JOX EO led to the recovery of 
  <italic>β</italic>-myrcene, germacrene-D, and mixtures of 
  <italic>α</italic>-pinene/
  <italic>β</italic>-pinene (ratio 70/30) and 
  <italic>α</italic>-pinene/germacrene D (ratio 65/45). All isolated compounds and recovered mixtures were tested for their repellent activity. From them, (−)-limonene, guaiol, germacrene-D as well the mixtures of (−)-limonene/
  <italic>β</italic>-pheladrene presented significant repellent activity (&gt;97% repellency) against 
  <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. The present methodology could be a valuable tool in the effort to develop potent mosquito repellents which are environmentally friendly.
