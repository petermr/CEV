 <italic>cassia</italic> essential oil (3.81 and 21.31 mg/mL, respectively, for larvae and nymphs of 
 <italic>H</italic>. 
 <italic>longicornis</italic>) and (

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) using the method described by Pedersen et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Exposure was performed by topical application in open Petri dishes (diameter, 9 cm). Briefly, the abdomen was held with a soft tweezer, causing the beetle to lower its head, which exposed the soft part between the pronotum and elytra. Each adult received a 1-µL droplet of the test solutions using a micropipette (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Likewise, larvae received a 1-µL droplet of the test solutions in the area that was proportionally equal in proximity to the head. Adults and larvae of 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>molitor</italic> exposed to LC
 <sub>50</sub> of fenvalerate (0.14 and 1.89 mg/mL, respectively, for larvae and nymphs of 
 <italic>H</italic>. 
 <italic>longicornis</italic>), as estimated in the toxicity bioassay, were used as a positive control. Negative control groups included adults and larvae exposed to 70% methanol and distilled water. Treated adults and larvae were transferred to clean Petri dishes (ten beetles per dish), and fed with wheat bran and potato slices. All dishes were maintained in the incubator [25 ± 1 °C, 70 ± 5% RH, 16:8-h photoperiod (L:D)]. The numbers of dead larvae and adults of 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>molitor</italic> were determined 48 h after treatment. 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>molitor</italic> that did not respond to the probe were considered dead. Each treatment and control group was replicated five times.
