 <italic>H</italic>. 
 <italic>longicornis</italic> exposed to LC
 <sub>50</sub> of the essential oil (3.81 and 21.31 mg/mL, respectively) and (

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Larvae and nymphs exposed to LC
 <sub>50</sub> of fenvalerate (0.14 and 1.89 mg/mL, respectively) (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) were used as a positive control. Negative control groups included larvae and nymphs exposed to 70% methanol and distilled water. The essential oil and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-cinnamaldehyde were selected due to their low LC
 <sub>50</sub> values against unfed larvae and nymphs of 
 <italic>H</italic>. 
 <italic>longicornis</italic> (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). About 20 mg of the larvae and nymphs that survived after treatments in the packet assays was homogenized in 400 µL pre-cooled phosphate-buffered solution (0.1 M, pH 7.2). The homogenate was centrifuged at 3000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> at 4 °C for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was removed and used for esterase and monooxygenase assays using the corresponding ELISA kit (Shanghai Enzyme-linked Biotechnology), and for the protein assay using bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Shanghai Enzyme-linked Biotechnology), following the manufacturer's instructions. For each tested concentration and control group, there were three replicates.
