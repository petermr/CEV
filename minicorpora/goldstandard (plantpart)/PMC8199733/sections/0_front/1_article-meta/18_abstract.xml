 <p>The use of growth-promoting antibiotics in livestock faces increasing scrutiny and opposition due to concerns about the increased occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Alternative solutions are being sought, and plants of Lamiaceae may provide an alternative to synthetic antibiotics in animal nutrition. In this study, we extracted essential oil from 
  <italic>Monarda didyma</italic>, a member of the Lamiaceae family. We examined the chemical composition of the essential oil and then evaluated the antibacterial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities of 
  <italic>M. didyma</italic> essential oil and its main compounds 
  <italic>in vitro</italic>. We then evaluated the effectiveness of 
  <italic>M. didyma</italic> essential oil in regard to growth performance, feed efficiency, and mortality in both mice and broilers. Carvacrol (49.03%) was the dominant compound in the essential oil extracts. 
  <italic>M. didyma</italic> essential oil demonstrated antibacterial properties against 
  <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (MIC = 87 µg·mL
  <sup>−1</sup>), 
  <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MIC = 47 µg·mL
  <sup>−1</sup>), and 
  <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic> (MIC = 35 µg·mL
  <sup>−1</sup>). Supplementing the diet of mice with essential oil at a concentration of 0.1% significantly increased body weight (+5.4%) and feed efficiency (+18.85%). In broilers, 
  <italic>M. didyma</italic> essential oil significantly improved body weight gain (2.64%). Our results suggest that adding 
  <italic>M. didyma</italic> essential oil to the diet of broilers offers a potential substitute for antibiotic growth promoters.
