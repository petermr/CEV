<p>The drive for alternatives to standard AGPs involves finding compounds that ensure poultry health and decrease bacterial resistance while maintaining producer profitability. Public pressure and concerns about food and environmental safety have led to an active search for alternative approaches that could eliminate or decrease the use of antibiotics, such as the use of essential oil, probiotics, prebiotics, and acidifiers in diets. As natural and multi-active agents, plant extracts and plant-derived products offer an interesting potential as substitutes for synthetic antibiotics and inorganic chemicals. Essential oil has some advantages over the others, by (1) improving growth performance and nutrient digestibility through antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activity, and (2) improving intestinal and general health of the broiler via antibacterial and coccidiostatic effects [

The positive effects of EO in the digestive tract of animals include the stabilizing of gut microbiota; this benefit could lead to further practices that improve intestinal health, digestion, and growth performance of livestock [
