 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-03368" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] added thyme essential oil to the diet of quail, resulting in significantly increased body weight gain and better feed efficiency relative to a control group. A member of the Lamiaceae, 
 <italic>Monarda didyma</italic> L., has been used for millennia by indigenous people in North America to treat colic, flatulence, colds, and flu. This plant is also used in infusions for intestinal and stomach problems [
