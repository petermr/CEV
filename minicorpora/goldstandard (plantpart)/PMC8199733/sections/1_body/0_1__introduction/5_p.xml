<p>At present, there are no studies on the bioactivity of

 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-03368" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] showed that thymol and carvacrol help stimulate digestion by affecting pathogenic microorganisms in the gut of broilers, thereby increasing their food conversion rate and weight. The protection and reinforcement of the intestinal microbiome in broilers is critical for maintaining the overall health and optimal absorption of nutrients in these animals [
