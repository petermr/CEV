<p>In this study, steam distillation was used to extract 
 <italic>M. didyma</italic> EO, and GC-MS and GC-FID were used to analyze the composition of the EO. The antibacterial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities of 
 <italic>M. didyma</italic> EO in vitro was assessed and results compared with the positive control 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-03368" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The objective of this study was to substitute standard antibiotics with 
 <italic>M. didyma</italic> essential oil, although the main compounds responsible for the biological activities were identified and the effects of 
 <italic>M. didyma</italic> EO on the growth performance, feed intake, and feed efficiency of mice and broilers were then evaluated.
