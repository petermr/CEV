 <italic>M. didyma</italic> EO also demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity. A concentration of 35 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup> inhibited fifty percent (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of NO induced by LPS in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Carvacrol (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 22.6 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 25.5 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) appeared to be responsible, in part, for this activity. Furthermore, a cell-based assay with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 4.6 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup> highlighted the EO antioxidant activity (
