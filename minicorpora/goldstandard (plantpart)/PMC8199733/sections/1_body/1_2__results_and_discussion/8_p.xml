<p>When 
 <italic>M. didyma</italic> EO was added to the diet of male broilers, during a growth period of 36 days, the treated broilers attained a BW of 2.65 kg with an average of 4.46 kg of FI by the animals. Control broilers with standard antibiotics weighed 2.58 kg after an average FI of 4.51 kg. Broilers fed with the EO-supplemented diet therefore showed a BW increase of 2.64% compared to control animals fed using standard antibiotics (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03368-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). A significant difference was observed for BW between the control and 
 <italic>M. didyma</italic> EO broilers in the first 10 days (268.5 g and 279 g, respectively). During the growth and finisher phases, broilers fed with the EO diet were significantly heavier than the control broilers with antibiotics and followed the same growth curve (
