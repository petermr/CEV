<p>No studies have yet tested EO diet supplements in mice; however, Denli et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-03368" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] observed that 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> EO caused BW gain and improved FE for quail. Platel et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-26-03368" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] concluded that adding various spices in food enhanced either enzyme activity related to digestion or increased the secretion of bile. Yang et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-03368" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] observed that EO supplementation during the growth period increased lipase, trypsin, and chymotrypsin activities significantly. EO also increased the fecal digestibility of dry matter and the digestibility of ether extract, fiber, fat, ash, and protein [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-03368" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The improvement of BW and FE in our study of mice was attributed to these processes.
