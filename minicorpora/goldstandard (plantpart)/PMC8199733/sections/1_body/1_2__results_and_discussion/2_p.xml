<p>These compound concentrations showed some differences to previous research on EO extracts from

 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-03368" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], analysis of EO from 
 <italic>M. didyma</italic> cultivated in central Italy found thymol (59.3%) to be the most dominant compound, followed by 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (10.3%), terpinolene (9.2%), delta-3-carene (4.4%), myrcene (3.7%), and camphene (3.4%). In 1967, Scora [

 <italic>M. didyma</italic> EO from California, found γ-terpinene (27.36%) as the most important compound, followed by d-limonene (12.93%), 1,8 cineole (12.24%), bornyl acetate (7.74%), ketone (5.50%), β-myrcene (4.88%), linalyl acetate (5.06%), α-terpinol (4.20%), and α-pinene (3.10%). Scora [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-26-03368" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] did not observe thymol or carvacrol in their EO samples; they concluded that the oil from the inflorescences contained smaller amounts of terpene components. Finally, Carron et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-26-03368" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] analyzed several North American 
 <italic>Monarda</italic> species. They found thymol and carvacrol to vary markedly between taxa, ranging from 8.5% thymol and 2.9% carvacrol in 
 <italic>M. didyma</italic> (red bergamot variety) to 46.6% thymol and 19.2% carvacrol in 
 <italic>M. fistulosa</italic> (Richters variety).
