<p>Given that 
 <italic>M. didyma</italic> EO demonstrated in vitro activities, the effectiveness of different concentrations of EO in the diet of mice on body weight gain (BW), feed intake (FI), and feed efficiency (FE) was assessed. A significant difference between the treatment groups and the negative control group for BW (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), FI (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and FE (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) was observed (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03368-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Supplementing the mouse diet with EO increased mouse BW throughout the experiment. EO concentrations of 0.1% 
 <italic>M. didyma</italic> and 0.1% 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> markedly increased mouse BW (respectively 5.4% and 9.4%), compared with the untreated mice (average of 5.58 g). EO dietary supplements decreased overall FI (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) for all EO concentrations, especially for 
 <italic>M. didyma</italic> 0.2% (145.24 g) and 
 <italic>M. didyma</italic> 0.1% (141.58 g), compared to untreated mice (164.83 g). Finally, 
 <italic>M. didyma</italic> 0.1% and 
 <italic>M. didyma</italic> 0.2% produced the lowest FE ratios at 23.98 and 25.13, respectively. Therefore, diets supplemented with 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> EO and 
 <italic>M. didyma</italic> EO at levels of 0.2% and 0.1% improved mouse BW and FE compared to the negative control.
