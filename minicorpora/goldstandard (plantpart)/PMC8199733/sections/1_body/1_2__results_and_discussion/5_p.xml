<p>The antibacterial and antioxidant activities of other members of the Lamiaceae family have been observed, principally for 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> and 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> [

 <xref rid="B36-molecules-26-03368" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]; however, the biological activities of 
 <italic>M. didyma</italic> are less well known. Fraternale et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-03368" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] used a DPPH and lipid peroxidation test to demonstrate the elevated antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>M. didyma</italic> EO. Numerous studies have highlighted the antibacterial and antioxidant activities of EOs that possess high levels of phenolic compounds such as thymol, carvacrol, and eugenol [

 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-03368" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-03368" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Thymol and carvacrol appear to be particularly effective against Gram-negative bacteria, in part because these compounds act on the outer membrane, such as by provoking the release of lipopolycaccharides, increasing the permeability of the cytoplasmic membrane, and depolarizing the cytoplasmic membrane. Furthermore, hydroxyl groups are highly reactive and form hydrogen bonds with active sites of target enzymes, inactivating them, and consequently create a dysfunction or rupture of the cell membrane [

 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-03368" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] also observed high and rapid thymol and carvacrol activity against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of the EO can produce a positive effect in the gastrointestinal tract.
