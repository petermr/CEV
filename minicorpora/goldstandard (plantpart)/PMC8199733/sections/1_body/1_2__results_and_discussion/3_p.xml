<p>The high relative concentration of carvacrol and the presence of thymol suggested a promising antibacterial activity for 
 <italic>M. didyma</italic> EO. Our observations of the antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>M. didyma</italic> EO against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (MIC = 87 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) and against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MIC = 47 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) confirmed this antibacterial potential. The positive control 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-03368">Table S1</xref>) was also effective against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (MIC = 109 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MIC = 111 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>). The antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>M. didyma</italic> EO versus 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> was provided mainly by carvacrol, which had respective MIC values of 65 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and 36 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, and thymol, which had respective MIC values of 110 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and 130 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. 
 <italic>M. didyma</italic> EO was also active versus 
 <italic>C. perfringens</italic>, producing an MIC of 35 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>; this antibacterial activity versus 
 <italic>C. perfringens</italic> was provided mainly by carvacrol that had an MIC of 18 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, as well as thymol, having an MIC of 55 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, and also limonene, which produced an MIC of 29 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup> (
