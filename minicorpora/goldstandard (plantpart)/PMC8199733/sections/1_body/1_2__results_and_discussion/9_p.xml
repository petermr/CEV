<p>Existing studies identify four different mechanisms that are important for EO action—sensorial, metabolic, antioxidant, and antibacterial activities [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-03368" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Hashemipour et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-03368" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] demonstrated that supplementing a broiler diet with 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg of thymol and carvacrol, respectively, produced no effect on FI, but significantly increased BW gain and improved the feed conversion ratio. Antibiotics in animals improve the BW by 5–6% and the FE by 3–4%, with the most pronounced effects observed in young animals [

 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-03368" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], supplementing the diets of broilers with a natural blend of EO (including thyme and oregano), observed no significant difference in growth performance during the starter period. Although higher mortality rates could be expected in the EO test group due to the lack of antibiotic use, Khattak et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-03368" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] found no significant difference between the mortality of broilers having the EO-supplemented diet and that of the control broilers.
