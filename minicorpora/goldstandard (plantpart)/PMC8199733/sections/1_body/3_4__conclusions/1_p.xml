<p>Our results confirmed the in vitro antibacterial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities of 
 <italic>M. didyma</italic> EO. A diet supplemented with 
 <italic>M. didyma</italic> EO significantly increased mouse BW and suggested good biological activity in broilers. EO has good potential as an alternative to synthetic antibiotics used in animal nutrition. Future research must explore 
 <italic>M. didyma</italic> EO in vivo antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>C. perfringens.</italic> Nonetheless, the different dosages of 
 <italic>M. didyma</italic> EO in the starter, growth, and finisher phases of the broiler diets remain to be tested to determine the optimal concentrations.
