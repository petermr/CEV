<p>Male broilers (
 <italic>n</italic> = 8216) were divided into four treatment groups: two control (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2054 each) and two treatment (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2054 each). The broilers were installed in an insulated room with facilities for control temperature, light, and humidity according to industry standards. Broilers were fed with the Nutrinor standard diet for poultry. The feeding program consisted of a starter (1–10 d), growth (11–20 d), and finisher (21–35 d) diet given to each broiler 
 <italic>ad libitum</italic>. The treatment group received 0.5% 
 <italic>M. didyma</italic> EO in the starter diet, 0.1% EO in the growth diet, and 0.05% EO in the finisher diet. The control group received standard antibiotics: Maxiban
 <sup>TM</sup> (0.5 kg/metric tons (MT)) and Tylosine (0.25 kg/MT). Broilers were weighed daily using an automatic balance installed in the hen house. Mortality was recorded daily and total FI was determined at the end of the experiment.
