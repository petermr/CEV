<p>Mice were fed with a mouse diet specifically designed to support the growth and maintenance of animals (LabDiet 5015; 20% protein, 25% fat, 55% carbohydrate). The treatments were prepared by adding concentrations of 
 <italic>M. didyma</italic> and 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> (used as the positive control) EO at 0.2% and 0.1%, to the original control diet. The food containing EO was prepared every week to ensure its freshness and quality. Our experiment was assessed for its ethical acceptability and was approved by the APC (Animal Protection Committee of UQAC, Université du Québec à Chicoutimi). Mice were housed in cages in an environmentally controlled room, having 12 h of darkness followed by a period of 12 h of light during the entire run of the experiment. Each cage was provided with a single feed and water system to provide 
 <italic>ad libitum</italic> access. Fifty (50) mice (five-week-old Charles River males) were placed in cages; each cage contained five randomly selected mice (two replicates). Each cage was assigned to one of five dietary treatments (four EO treatments and one negative control), giving a total of ten (10) experimental cages. The study was completed after 80 days of treatment. BW was measured twice a week and average FI determined on a weekly basis. For each week, the FE per cage was calculated based on the average BW and FI per mouse.
