 <italic>M. didyma</italic> L. EO was extracted by steam distillation for three hours from freshly harvested aerial parts (refractive index = 1.4977; density = 0.939 g·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>; yield (%) = 0.49). The plant came from Saint-Fulgence, Québec and was harvested at the beginning of August (Voucher QFA0625784). 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> L. EO (refractive index = 1.4797; density = 0.923 g·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) was purchased from Aliksir (Grondines, QC, Canada). The EO yield from extraction depended on the total amount of the raw material. The EO was then stored in the dark at a temperature of 4 °C until needed.
