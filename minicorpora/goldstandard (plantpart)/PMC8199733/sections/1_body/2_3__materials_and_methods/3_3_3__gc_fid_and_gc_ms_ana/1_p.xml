<p>All chromatographic analyses were run on an Agilent 6890N GC (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a non-polar DB-5 column and a polar SolGel-Wax column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 mm) as well as two flame ionization detectors (FIDs) (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The oils were injected in an undiluted (0.1 µL injection volume, split 1:235) and undried state (

 <sup>−1</sup> up to 210 °C. The temperature was then held at 210 °C for 13 min. Samples were also injected into an Agilent 7890A GC (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) coupled to an Agilent 5975C InertXL EI/CI mass spectrometer (MS) equipped with a DB-5MS column using the same temperature program as above and a split of 1:1000. Compounds were identified from their retention indexes as calculated from even-numbered C7 to C36 alkane standards and from Wiley 6N, MS databases (NIST08) and standard injection when available (LASEVE, UQAC, Chicoutimi, QC, Canada). Quantification was derived from the FID response on the DB-5 column without any correction factor.
