<p>The inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) production by 
 <italic>M. didyma</italic> EO and compounds was evaluated following Legault et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-26-03368" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Control L-NAME was used as a positive control. The murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells were incubated with EO or dissolved compounds in DMSO, then stimulated using 100 ng·mL
 <sup>−1</sup> LPS and incubated at 37 °C. After 24 h, the cell-free supernatant was collected and the NO concentration immediately determined using the Griess reaction. The absorbance was read at 540 nm using an automated Varioskan Ascent plate reader, and the presence of nitrite was quantified by comparing with a NaNO
 <sup>2</sup> standard curve, and IC
 <sub>50</sub> expressed 50% of NO inhibition.
