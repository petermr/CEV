<p>The antioxidant activity was evaluated using the DCFH-DA assay as described by Girard-Lalancette et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-26-03368" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Human skin fibroblasts WS1 were incubated for 1 h with a growing concentration of EO or dissolved compounds in DMSO. One hundred microliters of 200 ÂµM tert-butylhydroperoxide was then added and fluorescence immediately measured, and again after 90 min. Measurements were made on an automated plate reader (Fluoroskan Ascent FL, Labsystems, Milford, MA, USA) using an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm. Antioxidant activity was expressed as the concentration of extract inhibiting 50% (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of DCFH oxidation.
