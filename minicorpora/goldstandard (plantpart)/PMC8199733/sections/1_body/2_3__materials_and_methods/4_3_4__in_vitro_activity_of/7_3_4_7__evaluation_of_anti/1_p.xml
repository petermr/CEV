<p>The antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>M. didyma</italic> EO and compounds was tested using the antibacterial hydrophobic assay as described by Côté et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-26-03368" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Briefly, after micro-organisms passed 16–18 h at 37 °C in a nutrient broth base (Difco), 20 µL methanol containing growing concentrations of EO and compounds (3.1 to 200 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) was transferred onto nutrient agar in 96-well plates. Bacterial strains having a concentration of 2.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> colony-forming units (CFU) were then added per mL of nutrient broth. Bacterial suspension without treatment was used as a negative control, and bacterial suspension plus solvent were tested in parallel to demonstrate the absence of solvent toxicity. The blank consisted of a culture medium only and was subtracted from all subsequent measurements of each well. The 96-well plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 5 h to foster bacterial growth. One hundred microliters of resazurin sodium salt solution with a concentration of 50 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup> (Sigma R-2127, St-Louis, MO, USA) was then added to each well. Fluorescence was read on an automated Fluoroskan Ascent FLTM plate reader (Labsystems, Milford, MA, USA) after 2 h for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 3 h for 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>C. perfringens</italic>. The MIC was determined as the lowest concentration resulting in 95% inhibition of bacterial growth.
