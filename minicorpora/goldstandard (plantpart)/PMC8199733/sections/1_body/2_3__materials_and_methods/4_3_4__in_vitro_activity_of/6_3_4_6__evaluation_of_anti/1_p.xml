<p>The method described by Ou et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-26-03368" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] with some modifications was followed. Briefly, the ORAC assay was carried out in black 384-well microplates (Nunc) on a Fluoroskan Ascent FL™ plate reader (Labsystems) equipped with an automated injector. Four concentrations of Trolox (the control standard) (1.56, 3.13, 6.25, and 12.5 μM) were used in quadruplicate, and a gradient of 16 concentrations of the samples (compounds dissolved in DMSO or pure EO) was prepared without replication. The experiment was conducted at 37.5 °C and in a pH 7.4 phosphate buffer with a blank sample run in parallel. The fluorimeter was programmed to record the fluorescence (λ ex.: 485 nm/em: 530 nm) of fluorescein every minute after the addition of 375 mM of 2,2′-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH), for a total of 60 min. The final values were calculated using the net area under the curves of the sample concentrations for which a decrease of at least 95% of fluorescence was observed at 60 min. ORAC values were expressed in micromoles of Trolox equivalents (TE) per milligram (μmol TE·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>).
