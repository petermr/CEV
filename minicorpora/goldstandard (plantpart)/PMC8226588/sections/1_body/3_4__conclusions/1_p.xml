<p>The results of physical and chemical analysis of olive leaves from two Croatian domestic (Lastovka, Oblica) and two introduced (Leccino, Frantoio) cultivars from three harvest periods showed great diversity amongst cultivars. Leaf surface area was the most significant physical trait that distinguished cv. Lastovka from other cultivars. Color variability and total phenolic content showed a similar pattern amongst all cultivars, while essential oil volatiles clearly distinguished cv. Oblica from other cultivars. Various aldehydes, ketones, sesquiterpenes and saturated hydrocarbons made the greatest contribution in the differentiation of cv. Oblica from other cultivars, much more than any other parameter analyzed. Through all three harvest periods, cv. Oblica could be differentiated based on its essential oil volatile fingerprint.</p>
