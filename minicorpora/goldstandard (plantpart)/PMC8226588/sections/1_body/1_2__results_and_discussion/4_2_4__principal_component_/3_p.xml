<p>Unlike cv. Oblica, the Leccino cultivar also differs well from the other cvs. in the September and October harvests, while the pattern of volatiles in August does not differ from that of cv. Frantoio in October. Cvs. Lastovka and Frantoio exceptionally overlap and cannot be differentiated in any harvest period.</p>
