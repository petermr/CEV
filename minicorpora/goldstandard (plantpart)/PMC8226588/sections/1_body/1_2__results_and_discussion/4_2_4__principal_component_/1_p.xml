<p>To summarize the data obtained from the physical and chemical analysis, we subjected the values for surface area, color variability, total phenols and the volatiles in the amount larger than 2% to a principal component analysis. In order to furthered investigate our data, we performed additional PCAs separately for physical and chemical data, as well as for volatile compounds in the amount larger than 2% alone, to ask whether the volatile fingerprint of different cultivars per se can be a differentiating factor (

The first two PCAs from combined data of physical and chemical analysis explained 48.97% of the variance and distinguished cv. Oblica from the rest of the cultivars. The PCA performed only for the physical characteristics distinguished cv. Lastovka from the other three cultivars studied, which was expected since the highest of total four obtained communalities was for the surface area 0.978 (

The most interesting results were provided by PCA performed for volatile compounds where the first two PCAs explained 55.69% of variance and clearly differentiated volatile fingerprint of essential oil of cv. Oblica from cv. Lastovka and both introduced cultivars in all harvest periods (

Drobnica not according to their volatiles but according to main phenolic components, and were able to distinguish only cv. Drobnica on that behalf [
