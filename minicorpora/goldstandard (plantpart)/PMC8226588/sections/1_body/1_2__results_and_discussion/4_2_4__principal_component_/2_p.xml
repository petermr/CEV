<p>Although cv. Oblica is well distinguished in PCA in which physical and chemical analysis were included, more variance is explained in the first two PCAs for volatile compounds only, revealing the important role they play in profiling and discriminating between cultivars. The components differentiating cv. Oblica are located in the positive region of PC1 and both positive and negative regions of PC2. The volatiles presented in a higher amount that characterize cv. Oblica are mainly aldehydes ((
