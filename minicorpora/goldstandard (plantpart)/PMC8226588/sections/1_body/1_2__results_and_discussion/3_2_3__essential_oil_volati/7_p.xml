<p>Eleven sesquiterpenes have been identified, with β-caryophyllene particularly standing out as it appeared in very high amounts in the second harvest (September) in cv. Lastovka with 16.65%, increasing from 4.94% after the August harvest and decreasing to 10.23% in the last harvest in October. The lowest amount of β-caryophyllene was recorded in all harvest periods for the Oblica cultivar, while an increase followed by a decrease was observed in cvs. Leccino and Frantoio; somewhat more significantly in the Frantoio cultivar. α-copaene showed the highest percentage of all sesquiterpenes for the Oblica cultivar, with an increase in all three harvest periods, from 6.10% in August to 9.06% and 11.14% in September and October, respectively. α-farnesene was detected in low amounts in all cultivars, except in the cv. Oblica. Sesqiterpenes are a wide group of secondary metabolites that raise attention in the bio-pharmacological field, especially as potential natural anticancer compounds [
