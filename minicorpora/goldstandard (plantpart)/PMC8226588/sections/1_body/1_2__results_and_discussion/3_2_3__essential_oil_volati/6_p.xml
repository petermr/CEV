<p>Only two identified compounds belong to a group of saturated hydrocarbons: tetradecane and hexadecane, with tetradecane present in a greater amount. Cv. Oblica is particularly rich in these compounds, with over 20% in August harvest. A decrease in the concentration of saturated hydrocarbons was observed in all cultivars except in cv. Frantoio through all three harvest periods.</p>
