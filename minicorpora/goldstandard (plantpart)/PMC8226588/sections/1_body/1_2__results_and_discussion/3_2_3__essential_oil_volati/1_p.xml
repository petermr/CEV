 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-03533">Figures S1â€“S4</xref>. Statistical differences between cultivars and harvest periods are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-03533">Table S2</xref>. Overall, 45 volatile compounds were identified in essential oils, ranging from 93.46 (cv. Oblica) to 98.21% (cv. Frantoio) of the total identified compounds from the chromatograms. The identified volatile compounds include two alcohols, eight aldehydes, six ketones, two aromatic hydrocarbons, three esters, two saturated hydrocarbons, five monoterpenes, eleven sesquiterpenes, five heterocyclic compounds and a pyridine.
