<p>The main components of the essential oil from olive leaves of all four cultivars collected in August, September and October belonged to the ketone group, with (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-damascenone (23.78% for cv. Frantoio to 36.77% for cv. Leccino) being a major constituent with the exception of nonanal (24.80%) for cv. Leccino harvested in October and β-caryophyllene (16.65%) for cv. Lastovka in September. Previous studies on essential oils of cvs. Leccino and Frantoio conducted at different harvest periods in Italy also showed high percentage of ketones, (

 <xref rid="B35-molecules-26-03533" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. A higher presence of dihydrodehydro-β-ionone was detected for cv. Oblica in first and second harvest. Overall, regardless of the olive cultivar, ketones were the most represented chemical class, differentiating from 20.49% for cv. Lastovka harvest in September to 52.05% for cv. Leccino harvest in August. The identified ketones were 1,4-dimethyl-δ-3-tetrahydroacetophenone, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-damascenone, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-damascone, dihydrodehydro-β-ionone, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-geranyl acetone and β-ionone. Through our study, a significant decrease in ketones was observed in all cultivars except in cv. Lastovka, with a decrease in September and an increase in October.
