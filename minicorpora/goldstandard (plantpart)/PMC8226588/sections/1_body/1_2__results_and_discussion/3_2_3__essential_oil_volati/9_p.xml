<p>Monoterpenes represent a smaller fraction of volatiles in the studied cultivars. Five monoterpenes, cis-linalool oxide, trans-linalool oxide, limonen-4-ol, α-terpineol and β-cyclocitral were identified in all essential oils. Cis-linalool oxide was detected in all cultivars except in cv. Frantoio while trans-linalool oxide was present only in domestic cultivars.</p>
