<p>Physical characteristics were observed in all four cultivars through the measurements of surface area and color variability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03533-f001">Figure 1</xref>). There were significant differences amongst cultivars at each harvest period examined: cv. Oblica showed a significant difference in surface area at each individual harvest period while cvs. Lastovka, Leccino, and Frantoio differed significantly between harvests of August and September, as well as between September and October (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-03533">Table S1</xref>). Leaf surface area increased from August to September, followed by a decrease in October, following a similar pattern from a previous study on Portuguese cultivars [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-03533" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The leaves of cv. Frantoio were the largest and varied between 7.57 and 8.52, while the leaves of cv. Lastovka were the smallest and varied between 3.22 and 3.55 cm
