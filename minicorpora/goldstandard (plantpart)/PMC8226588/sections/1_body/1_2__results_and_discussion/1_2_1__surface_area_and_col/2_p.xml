<p>Leaf color variability was measured for three parameters: lightness (L*), greenness/redness (a*), and blueness/yellowness (b*). The parameter L* indicating lightness/darkness of the leaves was highest (43.37 ± 0.15) in cv. Leccino in the first harvest. Cv. Leccino was also the most negative cultivar for a* (−11.64 ± 0.09) indicating the highest level of green, and most positive for b* (17.48 ± 0.17) indicating the highest level of yellow (

Oblica for a* and b* which increased in September and decreased in October, as well as cv. Frantoio following the same pattern for b*. Malheiro et al. reported a similar pattern of changes in color values for different cultivars [

The overall reduction in darkness and the amounts of green and yellow could be attributed to the reduction in metabolic demand of olive leaves due to fruit ripening, resulting in a decrease in photosynthetic demand and chlorophyll content. The results are in accordance with those of Proietti et al. who showed that chlorophyll content decreased during the same period in cvs. Leccino and Frantoio [
