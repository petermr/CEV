<p>Cultivar Leccino showed significant statistical difference at each harvest period (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03533-f001">Figure 1</xref>), which decreased sharply until October (3025 ± 434 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup>). The amounts of total phenols in cvs. Frantoio and Oblica also decreased from August until October, with a significant difference only between August and October (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-03533">Table S1</xref>). The lowest amount of total phenols was observed in domestic cv. Oblica (August, 7902 ± 880 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup>). Cultivar Lastovka also showed an overall decrease in total phenol amount; however, it differed from other cultivars in the pattern of total phenol change showing a significant decrease from August until September, followed by an increase of total phenols till October. The concentration of phenolic compounds in olive leaves was shown to be highest in the summer months, indicating that the influence of temperature directly affects the synthesis of phenolic compounds [
