<p>In recent years, there has been a rising interest in studying olive leaves for their major bioactive compounds [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-03533" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Around 10% of the total weight of olives arriving at production mills is attributed to olive leaves, which makes them a highly available by-product from the table olive and olive oil industry [

 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-03533" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The leaves are rich in phenolic compounds such as phenolic acids, simple phenols, secoiridoids, flavonoids, lignans, and hydroxy-isochromans, all of which act as natural antioxidants [

The volatile fractions and essential oils from olive leaves consist of several valuable classes of chemical compounds that contribute to its beneficial health effects; mainly aldehydes, terpenoids, alcohols, and ketones, whereas they show antioxidant activity as well as antimicrobial and antifungal activity [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-03533" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The addition of olive leaves to olive oil improves its nutraceutical properties. The phenolic compounds from leaves add to the overall phenolic content of olive oil and their health benefits, as well as in the enhancement of the antioxidant capacity of olive oil. Volatile compounds found in essential oil could also contribute to additional nutraceutical and sensorial features [
