<p>The aim of this study was to determine differences in surface area, color, total phenolic amounts, and essential oil volatile profiles of olive leaves at different harvesting periods in order to investigate biodiversity amongst domestic Croatian and introduced cultivars. Four cultivars, two domestic cultivars Lastovka and Oblica, and two introduced cultivars Leccino and Frantoio were analyzed. Domestic cultivars Oblica and Lastovka are the most present cultivars in this region and of high local importance, whilst introduced cvs. Leccino and Frantoio are some of the most present olive cultivars in Mediterranean olive regions and serve as a good reference model in the distinguishment of domestic from introduced cultivars. All four cultivars are grown in the same olive orchard with the same environmental conditions, hence all of the differences would be attributed solely to the studied cultivar. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on essential oils in olive leaves conducted using Oblica and Lastovka cultivars from the Croatian part of Mediterranean basin.</p>
