<p>Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the essential oils was performed using a gas chromatograph (model 3900, Varian Inc., Lake Forest, CA, USA) and mass spectrometer (model 2100T, Varian Inc., Lake Forest, CA, USA). A non-polar capillary column VF-5ms (length 30 m, inside diameter 0.25 mm, coating thickness 0.25 µm, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was used for chromatography. Analyses were performed using MS full scan (40–350 
 <italic>m</italic>/

 <sup>−1</sup>, and kept isothermal for 25 min [

 <sup>−1</sup>. The ion source temperature was set at 200 °C and the ion voltage was 70 eV. Identification of individual peaks was made by comparison of their retention indices with the series of n-hydrocarbons, along with the computer matching of mass spectra with commercial databases (NIST 98 and Wiley 7) and by comparison with literature data [
