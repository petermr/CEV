<p>Approximately 250 g of fresh leaves per sample were placed to air dry at room temperature (22 °C) for 15 days. A hundred grams of dried leaves per sample were chopped and then hydro-distilled in a Clevenger apparatus for two hours and 30 min. Three replicate samples were distilled simultaneously. Pentane and diethyl-ether (VWR, Radnor, PA, USA) were used as solvents. The oil samples were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (Kemika, Zagreb, Croatia) and then stored in glass vials at 4 °C until further analysis.</p>
