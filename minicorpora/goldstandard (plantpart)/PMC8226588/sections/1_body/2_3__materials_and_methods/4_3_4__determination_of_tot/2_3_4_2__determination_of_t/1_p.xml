<p>The total phenolic content was determined according to the Folin–Ciocalteu method [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-26-03533" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] with slight modifications: leaves extract (0.5 mL) was mixed with distilled deionized water (9 mL) and Folin–Ciocalteu reagent (1mL) (Sigma-Aldrich, Steineheim, Germany). Sodium carbonate (Kemika, Zagreb, Croatia) (7 g/100 mL) was added five minutes after and filled with dd H
 <sub>2</sub>O up to a final volume of a 25-mL volumetric flask. Quantification was done by measuring the absorbance at 470 nm (Cary 50 UV-VIS spectrophotometer; Varian, CA, USA) after 90 min of reaction at room temperature against a prepared blank. All measurements were performed in triplicate and results were expressed as milligrams of gallic acid equivalents per gram of leaf (dry weight).
