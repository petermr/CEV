<p>Color analysis was performed on the same leaves samples of cvs. Lastovka, Oblica, Leccino and Frantoio on which dimensional measurements were determined by Konica Minolta Chroma Meter CR-400 instrument (Konica, Tokyo, Japan). Two measurements were made at the adaxial surface area of each leaf. Monochromatic variables L*, a* and b* were measured to determine color space co-ordinates: L* as a measure of lightness, a* as a measure of greenness/redness, and b* for blueness/yellowness. The colorimeter was calibrated against a standard white plate before leaf color measurement [
