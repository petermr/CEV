<p>In order to summarize the data and reduce the number of variables determined by physical and chemical analysis, the values of surface area, color, total phenols and essential oil volatiles in the amount larger than 2% from all cultivars at different harvest periods were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA). To further investigate our results, additional PCAs were performed separately for the physical and chemical analysis data, as well as for essential oil volatiles in the amount larger than 2%. The Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin measure of sampling adequacy was performed before the analysis to see if factor analysis is suitable for our data. To determine whether the factors could allocate different olive cultivars into the clusters, a two-dimensional score plot was performed. Varimax with Kaiser Normalization was used for the rotation method in the rotated component matrix. PCAs were performed using SPSS software, version 25.0 (IBM Corporation, New York, NY, USA).</p>
