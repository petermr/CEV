<p>To determine the difference in surface area, color, total phenols, and essential oil volatiles in the three harvest periods, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed by SPSS software, version 25.0 (IBM Corporation, New York, NY, USA). First, the data were tested for normal distribution of the residuals as well as for the homogeneity of variance by Shapiro–Wilk’s test. If the requirement of homogeneity was fulfilled, one-way ANOVA was performed; otherwise, Welch correction was preceded first. If there was a statistically significant effect between different harvest periods, Tukey’s honestly significant test for equal variances or Dunnett T3 test for non-equal variances was performed, at the significance level of
