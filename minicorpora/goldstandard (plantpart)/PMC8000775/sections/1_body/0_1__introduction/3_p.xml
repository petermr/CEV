<p>Ethnomedicinally, 
 <italic>L. egregia</italic> has seen traditional use in treatment of various ailments in humans. The roots and bark are used externally for ulcers, sores, and leprosy [

 <italic>L. egregia</italic> from Olokemeji Forest, Nigeria, were shown to have antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> using a zone-of-inhibition assay, but showed only weak activity with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) ranging from 6.3 to 25 mg/mL [
