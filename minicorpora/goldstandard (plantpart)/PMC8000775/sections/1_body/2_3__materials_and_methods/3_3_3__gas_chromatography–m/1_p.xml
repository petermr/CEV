<p>The leaf essential oils of 
 <italic>L. egregia</italic> and 
 <italic>E. sonchifolia</italic> were analyzed using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as previously described by us [
 <xref rid="B38-plants-10-00488" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]: Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 Ultra, ZB-5 ms GC column, GC oven temperature 50 °C–260 °C (2 °C/min), 1-μL injection of 5% solution of each essential oil dissolved in CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub> (split mode, 30:1). Each essential oil sample was injected three times. Retention indices (RI) were calculated in comparison with a homologous series of 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes. Compounds were identified by comparison of the MS fragmentation and retention indices with those in the databases [
