<p>A sample (450 g each) of 
 <italic>L. egregia</italic> leaves and 
 <italic>E. sonchifolia</italic> leaves was subjected to hydrodistillation thrice in an all-glass Clevenger-type apparatus. Each sample of 
 <italic>L. egregia</italic> and 
 <italic>E. sonchifolia</italic>, respectively, was mixed with water in a ratio of 2:6. The mixture was hydrodistilled for 3–4 h with constant stirring until no additional oil was observed to be distilled. For each plant species, the essential oils were combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate to eliminate traces of water, and stored in a sealed vial under refrigeration (4 °C) prior to analysis.
