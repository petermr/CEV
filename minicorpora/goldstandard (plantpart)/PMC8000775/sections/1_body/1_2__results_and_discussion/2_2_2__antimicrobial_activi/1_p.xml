<p>The leaf essential oils of 
 <italic>L. egregia</italic> and 
 <italic>E. sonchifolia</italic> were screened for antibacterial and antifungal activity against a panel of microorganisms (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00488-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). It has been suggested that essential oils having MIC values &lt; 100 μg/mL show very strong activity, those with MIC of 101–500 μg/mL show strong activity, 500 μg/mL &lt; MIC &lt; 1000 μg/mL are moderately active, and above 1000 μg/mL are inactive [

 <xref rid="B43-plants-10-00488" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Thus, the essential oils in this study can be considered strongly active. It is not readily apparent which essential oil components are responsible for the activities; most sesquiterpenes have not been individually screened for antimicrobial activity. However, three of the major components, β-pinene, linalool, and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene, were also screened in this work and these compounds showed activities similar to the essential oils themselves. The observed antimicrobial activities are consistent with some of the ethnobotanical uses of these two plants, and based on these results, either 
 <italic>L. egregia</italic> or 
 <italic>E. sonchifolia</italic> essential oil may be recommended for exploration as antibacterial or antifungal agents.
