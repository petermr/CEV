<p>Hydrodistillation of the leaves of 
 <italic>E. sonchifolia</italic> yielded a pale-yellow essential oil (0.46%). A total of 62 constituents, 97.60% of 
 <italic>E. sonchifolia</italic> volatile oil, were identified by GC-MS. The volatile oil composition is displayed in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00488-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and visualized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00488-f002">Figure 2</xref>. The leaf oil was dominated by sesquiterpenoids: γ-himachalene (25.16%), (

 <italic>E</italic>)-β-farnesene (3.96%), germacrene D (3.53%), and caryophyllene oxide (3.05%), in addition to the fatty acid palmitic acid (5.24%), and the monoterpene β-pinene (4.87%).
