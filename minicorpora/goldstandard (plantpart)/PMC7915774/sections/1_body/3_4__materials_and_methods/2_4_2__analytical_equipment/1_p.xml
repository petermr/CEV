<p>Terpenes were extracted from oil using the VASE 5800 system (Entech Instruments, Simi Valley, CA, USA). The system is based on extraction of volatile and semivolatile compounds into a trap filled with adsorbent (usually Tenax) with the aid of vacuum. The trap (sorbent pen) has a special construction that allows evacuation of air using a vacuum pump from the vessel/vial in which sampling is performed. After extraction, the vacuum from the vial is released, and the trap is inserted into a special thermal desorber, being part of the system, mounted as an injection port in GC/MS and controlled by the instrument’s electronic pressure control (EPC). The system, apart from thermal desorber, consisted of a sorbent pen conditioner, controller, software for desorption process control, and membrane pump providing a vacuum of 28” Hg. Sorbent pens used in the experiment were filled with Tenax. VASE 5800 system was mounted on a single quadrupole GC/MS system (7890A/7895 TAD MSD, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a DB-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.50 µm, Agilent Technologies). Helium at the flow of 1 mL/min was used as a carrier gas. The following GC oven program was used for analyses: initial temperature 40 °C for 3 min, then, an increase of 10 °C/min to 180 °C, and 20 °C/min to 280 °C (kept for 4 min). GC/MS transfer line was kept at 290 °C. Mass spectrometer was working in full scan mode in an

 <italic>z</italic> range 33–333, 6.6 scans/s. All peak area comparisons, as well as quantitation, was performed for total ion current (TIC) peaks. Terpenes were identified based on comparison with NIST 02 library, and for selected compounds, by comparison with authentic standards. Mass Hunter version 07.00.0 was used for controlling GC/MS system. The following parameters were used for VASE 5800 desorption system: preheat; duration: 2 min at 260 °C. Injection; split (1:25) achieved by splitter frit. Desorption; standby temperature 70 °C, duration 15 min desorption temperature 260 °C, desorption time 20 min. Bakeout; time 5 min at 260 °C. Post bake; duration 4 min, temperature 70 °C.
