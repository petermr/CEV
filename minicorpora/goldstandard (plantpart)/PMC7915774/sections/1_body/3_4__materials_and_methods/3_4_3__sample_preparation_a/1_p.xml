<p>Coriander oil was weighted into 44 mL screw top amber vials; the vials were capped with Teflon lined caps. Before analysis, the Teflon lined caps were replaced by special Entech metal caps, which could seal the sorbent pen for sampling. After inserting the sorbent pen into the vial, air was evacuated from the vial via the sorbent pen using a membrane pump with a manometer. Once the vacuum in a vial reached 28” Hg (after approximately 15 s), the pump was disconnected and extraction of volatile compounds began. When needed, the vials were heated in a metal block. Different sample sizes were tested (2000 mg, 1000 mg and 200 mg), as well as different extraction temperatures (60 °C, 40 °C, and 20 °C), and extraction times (3 min, 5 min, 10 min, and 20 min). Quantitative analysis was performed using refined rapeseed oil as a matrix into which terpene standards were dissolved directly (approximately 200 mg per compound in 20 mL of oil); then, serial dilutions were prepared.</p>
