<p>The extraction step is crucial in isolating the desired components from a complex biological matrix. There are conventional methods, including hydrodistillation, cold-pressed extraction, and, sometimes, solvent-based extraction; however, their greatest disadvantage is the time-consuming and low efficiency extraction, which results in high production costs. On the other hand, it is possible to use modern extraction methods (e.g., enzyme-assisted extraction, enzyme digestion, microwave-assisted extraction, pressurized liquid extraction, pulsed electric field extraction, supercritical fluid extraction, ohmic heating, and ultrasound-assisted extraction) that reduce the limitations of conventional methods. Nevertheless, supplying energy to the extraction system reduces target thermolabile biocomponents. The use of cold press is therefore not only an eco-friendly method, but also has an advantage over unconventional extraction methods in terms of product quality [
