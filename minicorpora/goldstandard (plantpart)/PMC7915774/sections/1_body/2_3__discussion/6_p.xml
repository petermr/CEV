<p>Interestingly, during hydrodistillation, geraniol and geranyl acetate were detected in high amounts, representing 2.13% and 2.68% of total volatiles, respectively (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00884-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). No experiments were run on the influence of distillation time on recovery of these compounds. From data obtained for 60 °C VASE extraction compared to 20 °C extraction, it is clear that, to obtain higher relative amounts of these two compounds, an increase of VASE extraction temperature would be needed. On the other hand, increased temperature reduces vacuum in the vial, also influencing the extraction process.
