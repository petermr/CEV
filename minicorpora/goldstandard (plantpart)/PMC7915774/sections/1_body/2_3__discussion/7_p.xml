<p>The main terpene alcohol in both extraction types, hydrodistillation and VASE, was linalool. When one compares basic physical parameters for linalool, geraniol, and geranyl acetate, the boiling points are 198 °C, 227 °C, and 238 °C, respectively. Their vapor pressures are 0.16 mm Hg, 0.03 mmHg, and 0.02 mmHg, respectively. Their logP values are 2.97, 3.56, and 4.04, respectively. Finally, the Henry’s constants are: 2.15 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup>, 1.15 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup>, and 2.43 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> atm–m
 <sup>3</sup>/mol respectively. The big differences in vapor pressure are mainly responsible for the low efficiency in VASE extraction, especially performed at 20 °C. Additionally, compounds with logP &gt; 3 are definitely lipophilic, so, in case of geraniol, and even more, geranyl acetate, their migration from lipophilic matrix (oil) to headspace is restricted. It has to be remembered that physical–chemical properties of the oil matrix is a main factor influencing migration of terpenes to the headspace.
