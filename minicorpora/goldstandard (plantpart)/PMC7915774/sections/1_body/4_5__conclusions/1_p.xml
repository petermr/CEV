<p>VASE extraction provides rapid characterization of terpene compounds in cold pressed coriander oil, attainable at room temperature within 5 min. To increase the volatiles transfer from the oil matrix to headspace, extraction at higher temperatures (60 Â°C) can be performed if needed. As the method is partition coefficient dependent, the profile of extracted compounds may differ from hydrodistillation, especially considering proportions of monoterpene alcohols (higher % in distilled oil) and monoterpene hydrocarbons (higher % obtained for VASE extractions). Apart from rapid profiling of terpenes, VASE can be used for their quantitation in oil matrix. The VASE technique relies on a relatively simple setup, in which sorbent pens are desorbed manually, but with satisfying repeatability. Moreover, it does not need cryofocussing, or another type of refocusing in the desorption process, which makes the setup uncomplicated and robust. The setup of the VASE unit and sequence of operations is presented in

We should also note that sorbent pens can be used multiple times (&gt;hundred from our experience), so single analysis cost is reasonable. This extraction technique is solventless; therefore, contributes to the green chemistry trend, minimizing its impact on the environment.
