<p>The essential oil was analysed by gas chromatography-flame ionisation detector (GC-FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometry (GC-MS) techniques [

 <xref rid="B64-plants-10-01176" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. GC-MS analysis was conducted by an Agilent 5975 GC-MSD system coupled to an Agilent 7890A GC (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). An HP-Innowax FSC column (60 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness) was used with helium (purity 99.99%) as a carrier gas (1.2 mL/min). Other analytical details were reported in our previous papers [

 <xref rid="B64-plants-10-01176" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The identification of components was based on a retention index (RI) determined by co-injection with reference to a homologous series of 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes (C8–C30), under the same experimental conditions. Further identifications were achieved by comparing their mass spectra with those from NIST 05 and Wiley Eighth version, as well as by comparison of their RIs with literature values.
