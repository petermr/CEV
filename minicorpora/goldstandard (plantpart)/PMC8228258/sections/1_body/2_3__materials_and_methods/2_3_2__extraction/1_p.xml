<p>The aerial parts of the plant materials were grounded, and then 10 g were separately extracted with hexane, ethyl acetate, methanol, and methanol/water (80%) in maceration technique (for 24 h, room temperature). The extracts were evaporated to dryness and stored at 4 °C until analysis. Regarding water extracts, we used traditional infusion techniques, and 5 g plant materials were kept with 100 mL of boiled water for 15 min. Then, the water extracts were lyophilised. The extracts procedure were performed in triplicate and the obtained extracts were stored at 4 °C until analysis.</p>
