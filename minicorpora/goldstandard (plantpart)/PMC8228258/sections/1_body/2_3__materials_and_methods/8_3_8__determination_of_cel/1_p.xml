<p>Cells were plated in 96 well plates at 5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/well (HepG2 and S17) and 2 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/well (B16 4A5). After a 24 h incubation period, cells were treated with the samples at the concentration of 100 μg/mL for 72 h. Cells incubated with DMSO at 0.5% (the highest DMSO concentration used in the test wells) were used as the control. The cellular viability was determined by the MTT 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) test, as described formerly [
 <xref rid="B68-plants-10-01176" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. The percentage of viable cells was calculated relative to the control (DMSO, 0.5%).
