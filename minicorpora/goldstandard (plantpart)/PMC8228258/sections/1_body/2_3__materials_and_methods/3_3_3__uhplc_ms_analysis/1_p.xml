<p>Chromatographic separation was accomplished with a Dionex Ultimate 3000RS UHPLC instrument, equipped with a Thermo Accucore C
 <sub>18</sub> (100 mm × 2.1 mm i. d., 2.6 μm) analytical column for the separation of compounds. Water (A) and methanol (B) containing 0.1% formic acid were employed as mobile phases, respectively. The total run time was 70 min for the elution profile. Mass spectrum analysis was carried out using a Thermo Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with an electrospray ionisation probe interface in positive and negative-ion mode. All detailed analytical conditions have been published [
