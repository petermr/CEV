<p>Antioxidant protocols included reducing power (cupric-reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC) and ferric-reducing power (FRAP)), metal chelating, phosphomolybdenum (PBD), and free-radical scavenging (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS)) activities. Experimental details were as described previously by [
 <xref rid="B67-plants-10-01176" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Inhibitory effects of the extracts were tested against different enzymes (tyrosinase, α-amylase, α-glucosidase, and cholinesterases). Trolox and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) for antioxidant, galantamine for cholinesterases, kojic acid for tyrosinase, and acarbose for α-amylase and α-glucosidase were used to express antioxidant and enzyme-inhibitory results.
