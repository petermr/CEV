<p>All quantitative analyses were performed in triplicate (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3), and data were expressed as means ± S.D. Significant differences in the tested samples were determined by an ANOVA (Tukey test), with a probability value of 5%. Pearson’s correlation was estimated to identify the relationship between the total amounts of phenolics and flavonoids, and the biological activities (antioxidant and enzyme-inhibitory effects). R software (Version 3.6.2) was used for the statistical analysis.
