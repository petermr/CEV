<p>For the first time, the biological activities and phytochemical profiles of the aerial parts of 
 <italic>N. baytopii,</italic> endemic from Turkey, were evaluated. Extraction of the aerial parts was performed using solvents of different polarity. Furthermore, the essential oil of the plant was prepared by hydro-distillation. The water/methanol and water extracts possessed appreciable amounts of phenolic compounds and showed the highest antioxidant capacities in vitro. Phytochemical profiling revealed the presence of flavones, such as luteolin and apigenin and their derivatives in both the water and methanol extracts. The ethyl acetate extract showed pronounced inhibitory properties against butyrylcholinesterase, highlighting the possibility for a new, efficient Alzheimerâ€™s disease therapeutic agent. The high cytotoxicity of 
 <italic>N. baytopii</italic> aerial parts methanol extract against HepG2 suggests further future investigations in this area. The data presented here showed that the endemic 
 <italic>N. baytopii</italic> possessed many interesting biological activities and is certainly encouraging for a future application in the pharmaceutical and nutraceutical fields, although further tests are necessary.
