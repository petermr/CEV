<p>GC-MS was used to determine the composition of 
 <italic>N. baytopii</italic> aerial parts in the essential oil, and the data were presented in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-01176-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. A total of 10 compounds have been identified from the 
 <italic>N. baytopii</italic> essential oil. Caryophyllene oxide, a sesquiterpenoid oxide common to lemon balm and eucalyptus, was identified in high concentration in 
 <italic>N. baytopii</italic> essential oil (39.3%) [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-10-01176" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Another sesquiterpene, spathulenol (15.6%), was identified in appreciable amounts from 
 <italic>N. baytopii</italic> essential oil. Kilic and colleagues also reported a lower concentration of caryophyllene oxide in the essential oil of 
 <italic>N. baytopii</italic> aerial part [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-10-01176" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These differences in the levels of essential oil components could be explained by geographical and climatic differences. Additionally, different compounds (caryophyllene, limonene, nepetalactone and 1,8-cineole, etc.) were identified as main components in the essential oils of some 
 <italic>Nepeta</italic> species [
