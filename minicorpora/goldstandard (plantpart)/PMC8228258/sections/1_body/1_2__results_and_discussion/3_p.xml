<p>The dearth of scientific information regarding the antioxidant capacities of 
 <italic>N. baytopii</italic> has fuelled the need for the comprehensive evaluation of the antioxidant properties of the different extracts and the essential oil of this endemic species. In order to evaluate the antioxidant properties of the extracts and essential oil of 
 <italic>N. baytopii</italic> aerial part, six bioassays were conducted. These assays included free-radical scavenging (DPPH and ABTS), reducing power (FRAP and CUPRAC), metal chelating, and phosphomolybdenum. These findings are presented in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-01176-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Several studies have reported the relationship between high phenolic/flavonoid content and antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-10-01176" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-plants-10-01176" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-plants-10-01176" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The total antioxidant capacity of the extracts was assessed using the phosphomolybdenum method. As shown in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-01176-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, the methanol (2.45 mmol TE/g) and ethyl acetate (2.36 mmol TE/g) extracts were the most active. However, we did not observe any statistical difference among the ethyl acetate and methanol extracts (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Moreover, essential oil 
 <italic>N. baytopii</italic> aerial parts also showed a better total antioxidant ability than those of water/methanol and n-hexane extracts (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The total antioxidant ability could be attributed to the presence of different compounds in the extracts or essential oils. In this sense, as can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-01176-f001">Figure 1</xref>, we observed a weak correlation between total phenolics and phosphomolybdenum results, but the correlation value was high for total flavonoids. Determining the ability of natural compounds to quench free radicals provides an estimation of their possible scavenging activity in other systems. As shown in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-01176-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, the water/methanol extract of 
 <italic>N. baytopii</italic> aerial part showed the highest scavenging activity against DPPH (94.40 mg TE/g) and ABTS (129.22 mg TE/g). In the ABTS assay, n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and the essential oil exhibited similar scavenging abilities (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). In addition, these extracts and the essential oil did not have any scavenging ability on the DPPH radical. The reducing capacity of the compounds to donate an electron and thus act as reducing agents is commonly assessed using two widely used methods, namely, FRAP (ferric ion) and CUPRAC (cupric ion) assays [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-10-01176" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In the present study, the water extract of 
 <italic>N. baytopii</italic> exhibited the highest Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> (129.55 mg TE/g)- and Cu
 <sup>2+</sup> (229.37 mg TE/g)-reducing potentials. In these reduced power assays, all tested samples exhibited different abilities (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). As can be seen in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-01176-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="plants-10-01176-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, generally, the free radical scavenging and reduced power results could be correlated with their total phenolic contents (
 <italic>r</italic> &gt; 0.8). Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient values are given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-01176-f001">Figure 1</xref>. Thus, it resulted that phenolic compounds are the main contributors to the antioxidant properties of 
 <italic>N. baytopii.</italic> Similarly, several researchers have reported a strong correlation between antioxidant properties and the total amounts of phenolics [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-10-01176" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-plants-10-01176" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-plants-10-01176" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Moreover, some authors have argued that the phenolic compounds in the members of the 
 <italic>Nepeta</italic> genus were main players in the antioxidant assays [
 <xref rid="B30-plants-10-01176" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-plants-10-01176" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-plants-10-01176" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. As another mechanism, transition metals are known to participate in Fenton reactions, generating free radicals and exacerbating the oxidative stress status. Therefore, the chelation capacity of 
 <italic>N. baytopii</italic> aerial parts extracts and essential oil were assessed. Results presented herein demonstrated that the water extract and water/methanol extracts possessed a stronger chelating ability as compared with other extracts and essential oils (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The metal-chelating abilities of the tested extracts might be due to the presence of phenolics, and the correlation analysis was confirmed by this fact (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.77).
