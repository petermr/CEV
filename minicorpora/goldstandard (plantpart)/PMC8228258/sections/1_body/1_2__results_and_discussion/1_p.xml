<p>Folinâ€“Ciocalteu and aluminium chloride assays are rapid, simple, and low-cost procedures which provide an overview of the phenolic and flavonoid contents of plant extracts. These widely used methods underpin detailed phytochemical profiling using cutting-edge technologies. As shown in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-01176-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the water extract (50.30 mg GAE/g) possessed the highest concentration of phenolics, followed by the water/methanol extract (41.25 mg GAE/g). The ethyl acetate extract rich in flavonoids contained the value of 27.02 mg RE/g. Hexane extract possessed the lowest phenolic (13.23 mg GAE/g) and flavonoid (7.77 mg RE/g) contents. Additionally, both total amounts of phenolics and flavonoids were significantly affected by the extraction solvents used (

 <italic>Nepeta</italic> extracts [

 <italic>N. baytopii</italic> aerial parts methanol and water extracts were provided in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-01176-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="plants-10-01176-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, respectively. UHPLC profiling confirmed the presence of 46 and 43 compounds from methanol and water extracts, respectively. Chromatograms are depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-10-01176">Supplemental Material (Figures S1 and S2</xref>). Flavones, such as luteolin and apigenin and their derivatives, were identified from both extracts. Fertaric acid, a hydroxycinnamic acid and ester of ferulic acid and tartaric acid, was present in the methanol and water extracts. In general, the detailed phytochemicals of the methanol and water extracts of 
 <italic>N. baytopii</italic> aerial parts were quite similar, which might be related to the polar nature of the solvents. In addition, the concentration of the different components in the methanol and water extracts might be different, and this was not specified in our data. In accordance with our results, the presence of flavones and hydroxycinnamic acid in the members of the 
 <italic>Nepeta</italic> genus was reported in earlier studies [
