<p>Several species of the

 <xref rid="B57-plants-10-01176" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,
 <xref rid="B58-plants-10-01176" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Herein, the methanol and water extracts were tested with HepG2, human hepatocarcinoma cells (
 <xref rid="plants-10-01176-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Hepatocellular carcinoma, the most common liver malignancy, is a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide [
 <xref rid="B58-plants-10-01176" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In this work, the methanol extract of 
 <italic>N. baytopii</italic> aerial parts showed high cytotoxicity (31.7%) against HepG2 while water was non-cytotoxic. Melanoma is a type of skin cancer occurring in melanocytes, which are dendritic-like cells producing melanin pigment [
 <xref rid="B59-plants-10-01176" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. We observed that the water extract (70.2%) showed higher cytotoxicity against mouse melanoma cell (B16 4A5). We also determined the cytotoxic effect of 
 <italic>N. baytopii</italic> aerial parts against non-tumoral murine bone marrow stromal, and the results are presented in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-01176-t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>. The methanol extract (34.8%) was more cytotoxic than the water extract (61.5%). In the literature, in accordance with the presented results, several 
 <italic>Nepeta</italic> species, such as 
 <italic>N. curvidens</italic> [
 <xref rid="B60-plants-10-01176" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], 
 <italic>N. curviflora</italic> [
 <xref rid="B61-plants-10-01176" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], and 
 <italic>N. nuda</italic> [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-10-01176" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] exhibited remarkable cytotoxic effects on several cell lines.
