<p>The inhibitory ability of 
 <italic>N. baytopii</italic> aerial parts extracts and essential oil were tested against enzymes linked to a critical role in the development of diabetes mellitus type II, Alzheimer’s disease, and skin hyperpigmentation problems. Diabetes mellitus type II and Alzheimer’s disease have escalated to epidemic proportions, and the need for complementary therapeutic agents to effectively manage these debilitating conditions are of paramount importance. From 
 <xref rid="plants-10-01176-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, the ethyl acetate extract of 
 <italic>N. baytopii</italic> aerial parts exhibited the highest activity against AChE (4.57 mg GALAE/g) and BChE (10.85 mg GALAE/g). In AChE inhibition, n-hexane and methanol extracts displayed similar actions (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). The high galantamine equivalent value recorded on BChE supported appreciably high inhibitory action in comparison to other 
 <italic>Lamiaceae</italic> species [

 <xref rid="B42-plants-10-01176" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The inhibition of BChE has been advocated in the later stage of Alzheimer’s disease. During the progression of the disease, the BChE level increases, exacerbating the conditions of the patient [
 <xref rid="B43-plants-10-01176" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Herein, the ability of 
 <italic>N. baytopii</italic> aerial parts extracts and essential oil to inhibit α-amylase and α-glucosidase was also evaluated. These enzymes play critical roles in hyperglycaemia, the hallmark of diabetes mellitus. In diabetes mellitus type II management, the inhibition of enzymes responsible for the hydrolysis of polysaccharides to glucose monosaccharide, which can be absorbed in the intestinal system. Herein, methanol extract showed the highest (8.15 mmol ACAE/g) activity against α-glucosidase. Interestingly, the hexane and ethyl acetate extract were also good inhibitors of α-glucosidase. α-Glucosidase situated at the brush border of the small intestine catalyses the hydrolysis of disaccharides into glucose. Therefore, the inhibition of α-glucosidase reduces glucose formation, glycaemic peaks, and hyperglycaemia. Apart from these debilitating maladies, the ability of 
 <italic>N. baytopii</italic> aerial parts extracts and essential oil to inhibit tyrosinase was also evaluated. Tyrosinase is the key enzyme targeted in skin hyperpigmentation treatment. In fact, the inhibition of tyrosinase reduces the production of the brown pigment melanin. Herein, the methanol and water/methanol extracts possessed the highest tyrosinase inhibition values (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). The search for natural compounds possessing tyrosinase inhibitory characteristics is of particular interest in the dermato-cosmetic industry, and this has been fuelled by the interest of the general public for naturally derived products. Observed enzyme inhibitory properties of 
 <italic>N. baytopii</italic> extracts might be explained by their chemical components. Some components such as apigenin, naringenin, luteolin, and chlorogenic acid have been reported as significant enzymes inhibitors [

 <xref rid="B54-plants-10-01176" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], and thus, 
 <italic>N. baytopii</italic> could be considered as a promising source of natural enzyme inhibitors. Interestingly, several researchers reported on the enzyme inhibition abilities of some 
 <italic>Nepeta</italic> species. For example, Sarikurkcu et al. [
 <xref rid="B55-plants-10-01176" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] reported the inhibitory properties of 
 <italic>N. nuda</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>glandulifera</italic> and 
 <italic>N. cadmea</italic> on cholinesterases, amylase, glucosidase, and tyrosinase. When compared with our results, the 
 <italic>Nepeta</italic> species exhibited lower enzyme inhibition properties than 
 <italic>N. baytopii</italic>. Furthermore, different research groups reported the enzyme-inhibitory effects of several 
 <italic>Nepeta</italic> essential oils. For example, 
 <italic>N. nuda</italic> and 
 <italic>N. cadmea</italic> essential oils exhibited moderate inhibitory effects on some enzymes, and the main compounds were geijerene and nepetalactone in these essential oils, respectively [
 <xref rid="B9-plants-10-01176" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. As a structure-ability approach, essential oils have a complex nature, and thus, observed enzyme inhibitory abilities could be caused by different factors, including the main compounds and interactions of these components.
