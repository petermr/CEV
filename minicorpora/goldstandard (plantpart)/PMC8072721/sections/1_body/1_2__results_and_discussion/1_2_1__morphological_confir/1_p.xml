<p>The morphological descriptions of the specimens of the 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> spp. known locally as huajiao (HJ), makwoung (MKO), and makwhaen (MK1-3) were documented using plant structure, thorn, leaf type, floral structures, and fresh fruit color [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-10-00803" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. From our data in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-10-00803">Supplementary Table S1</xref>, the plant structure of HJ was of shrub and was different from that of MKO and MK1-3 (tree-like structure). Thorns of all specimens were either initiate on the trunk or branches. The same compound leaf type was observed in the MKO and MK1-3 (even-pinnately) which were different from the HJ (odd-pinnately compound leaf). The floral compositions were different in every species; the HJ consisted of the flower with six to nine petals, while the MKO was with four petals and MK1-3 were with five petals. Within a similar pattern, the number of anthers was different in every species, four to eight anthers for HJ, three or four anthers for MKO, and five anthers for MK1-3. The color of fresh fruit was red in HJ and MKO while MK1-3 gave greenish-red color characteristics. Fruit sizes varied from 2–3 mm of the MK1-3 to 4–5 mm of the HJ and the MKO was 5–7 mm, respectively. The three species gave brown fruit when dried with crack revealing the inner seeds. According to these specific characteristics, the scientific names of 
 <italic>Z</italic>. 
 <italic>armatum, Z</italic>. 
 <italic>rhetsa</italic>, and 
 <italic>Z</italic>. 
 <italic>myriacanthum</italic> are given to HJ, MKO, and MK specimens [

 <xref rid="B23-plants-10-00803" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. To describe the verity within the same species, floral and fruit characteristics of MK1-3 were compared (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-10-00803">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). The result confirmed that the MKs were those of 
 <italic>Z</italic>. 
 <italic>myriacanthum</italic> as the sepals and petals were pentamerous and male flower organs composed five stamens.
