<p>Plants of the

 <italic>myriacanthum</italic> is grown extensively in many areas of northern Thailand viz., Pong district of Payao, Song Khwae district of Nan and in many high-altitude areas of Chiang Mai [

With an increasing commercial need for exotic ingredients, there is, therefore demands for high-quality raw material of essential oil for food and perfumery industries. To the perfumery industry claim, the complaint made from the raw material purchaser asserted that plant morphological characteristics such as tree structure, sizes, and color of the berry clusters were variable in different sourcing regions which made the final quality of essential oil unsteady (Mrs. Anne Saget pers. Comm.). Moreover, the complexity within the species remains ambiguous as such
