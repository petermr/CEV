<p>The banding pattern for each primer was scored as diallelic (1 = band present, 0 = band absent), and stored in an Excel (Microsoft) spreadsheet file in the form of a binary matrix. To determine the genetic differentiation between the five samples accessions, 10 RAPD markers were analyzed using the statistical package XLSTAT version 2016 software. The coefficients of genetic similarity for all the pair-wise comparisons were computed using Jaccardâ€™s coefficient of similarity and then the distance matrix was subjected to cluster analysis by using the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) to produce a dendrogram.</p>
