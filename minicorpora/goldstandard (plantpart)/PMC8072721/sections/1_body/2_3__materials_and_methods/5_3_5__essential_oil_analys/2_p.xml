<p>Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis was performed on Bruker-Scion 436 GC (Bruker, Hamburg, Germany) a Rxi 5Sil MS (30 m × 0.25 mm; 0.25 μm film thickness) (Restek, Bellefonte, PA, USA). Essential oil samples (2 µL at the dilution of 1%,

 <sub>20</sub> n–alkanes (Sigma–Aldrich, Steineheim, Germany) were used for identification of all constituents by calculation of the retention indexes (RI). The compounds were confirmed by their RI as well as those from the literature [
