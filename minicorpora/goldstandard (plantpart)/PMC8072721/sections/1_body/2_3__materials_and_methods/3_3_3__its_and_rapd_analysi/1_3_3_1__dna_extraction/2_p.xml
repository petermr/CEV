<p>After extraction, total DNA was quantified using a nano-drop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop
 <sup>TM</sup> 1000 Spectrophotometer, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bath, UK). For re-quantification, the extracted DNA was run on 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis using 1× TBE buffer at 5–8 V·mL
 <sup>−1</sup> for 30 min and visualized under BLook LED transilluminator (Genedirex, Taoyuan, Taiwan) by staining with MaestroSafe TM (Maestrogen, Las Vegas, NV, USA). The DNA solution was diluted with sterile distilled water (DI) to a concentration of 10 ng·μL
 <sup>−1</sup> for PCR analysis and kept at −20 °C until use [
