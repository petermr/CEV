<p>For the extraction of DNA, the DT-S DNA extraction kit (Kurabo, Osaka, Japan) was used with modification of the CTAB extraction procedure. Young leaf tissue of three 
 <italic>Zanthozylum</italic> spp. from five samples (0.5 g) were ground to powder using a mortar and pestle in the presence of liquid nitrogen and transferred to a 1.5 mL polypropylene centrifuge tubes and follow the steps of the DNA extraction kit. Tissue lysis-buffer (MDT) 200 µL and proteinase K (EDT) 20 µL were combined and mixed. After that, the centrifuge tubes were incubated by using the incubator at a temperature of 55 °C for an hour. At this stage, the centrifuge tubes were flipped every 15 min. Then, these tubes were centrifuged at 10,000× 
 <italic>g</italic>. When the process was completed, the supernatant (~200 µL) was moved to a new centrifuge tubes and 180 µL lysis buffer (LDT) was added. Later, these new tubes were centrifuged with vortex for 15 s. before they were incubated at a temperature of 70 °C for 10 min. A solution was moved into the new cartridge tubes and west tubes, then these tubes were aerated. After that, 75 µL wash buffer (WDT) was added into the tubes. These tubes were aerated repeatedly three times to elute DNA. Then, the cartridge tubes were moved into the collection tubes. At this stage, 50 µL elution buffer (CDT) was added and left for 30 min. After that, they were aerated repeatedly for two times. Finally, the centrifuge tubes were tested and stored at a temperature of −20 °C.
