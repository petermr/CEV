<p>Even though a large number of secondary metabolites interfere with DNA sequencing, morphological description is adequate for the differentiation of plant belonging to the 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> genus. The locally known makhwaen were taxonomically and genetically confirmed as 
 <italic>Z</italic>. 
 <italic>myriacanthum</italic>. From the principal component evaluation, huajiao essential oil was described to have different aroma characteristic as compared to the rest of 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> spp. analyzed. The essential oils of makwoung and makhwaens from Nan and Chiang Mai were similar in terms of quantity and characteristics of the chemical compositions. For example, limonene and sabinene represent the aroma of citrus and woody. In summary, for sourcing of the raw material, phenotypical characteristic can be used to distinguish the species. Furthermore, the chemical profile of the essential oil depends upon the genotypes which closer similarity was with makwoung and makhwaen, whereas huajiao represented the unique chemotype of citrus-floral aroma.
