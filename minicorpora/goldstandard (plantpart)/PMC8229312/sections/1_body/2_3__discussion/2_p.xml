<p>The result obtained for the chemical composition analysis of 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> EO from Algiers (
 <xref rid="plants-10-01066-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) revealed that they contain varying quantities of different phytochemicals. Notable phytochemicals found include geranial (45.060%), neral (31.720%), citronellal (6.420%), curcumene-(β) (1.590%), and (β)-caryophyllene (2.200%). The result is analogous to the results that were obtained in other countries such as Serbia [

 <xref rid="B38-plants-10-01066" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Again, varying quantities of the phytochemicals were found in EOs from other regions considered in this study (
 <xref rid="plants-10-01066-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). From these studies, it is clear that the content of essential oils in 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> varies from one place to another according to the geographical diversity as they are similar in countries that have an almost similar geographical area, and the proportions differed in countries that are not geographically similar, among other factors [
