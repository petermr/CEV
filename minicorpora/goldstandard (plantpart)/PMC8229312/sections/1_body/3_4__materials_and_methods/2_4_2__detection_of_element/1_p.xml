<p>The studied samples were prepared as described by Benarfa et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-plants-10-01066" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] with slight modification. The samples were washed well with tap water and then with deionized water in order to remove soil particles and dust, then dried carefully for 48 h in an oven at 30°C. Next, the dried samples were ground manually using an agate mortar and pestle, before sieving them through a stainless steel sieve (150 µm mesh size) and then placing in an aluminum irradiation capsules as well as the standards. In this study, two standard reference materials were used. The first one was NIST-SRM 1573a (tomato leaves) from the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST), and the second was Chinese tea leaves (GBW 07605, National Research Center for CRM, Lang fang, China). The capsule prepared was subjected to thermal neutron flux for two hours. The work was carried out by ray gamma detection using high-purity germanium (HPGe) cooled using liquid nitrogen. The system has the following characteristics: relative efficiency: 35%, FWHM 1.8 keV for the 1332.5 keV γ-peak of 
 <sup>60</sup>Co. The first measurement was 2 h after 3 day; the second measurement for the long-lived radionuclides was after day 18 for a collection time of 4 h.
