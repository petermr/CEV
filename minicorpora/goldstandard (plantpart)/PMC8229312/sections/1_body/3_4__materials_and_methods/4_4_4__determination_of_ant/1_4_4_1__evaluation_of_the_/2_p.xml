<p>The IC50 inhibitory concentration value represents the dose of EO that causes the neutralization of 50% of the DPPH radicals. The IC50, used as an estimate of the antioxidant activity by DPPH, is estimated by extrapolation by plotting the percentage inhibition (I%) curve as a function of the concentrations. All tests were performed in three runs and IC50 values were reported as the mean Â± SD.</p>
