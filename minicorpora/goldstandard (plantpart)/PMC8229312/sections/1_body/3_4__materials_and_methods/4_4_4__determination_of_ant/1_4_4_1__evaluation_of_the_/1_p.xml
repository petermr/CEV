<p>This is the most widely used method to assess the antioxidant activity of herbal drugs. This test aims to measure the ability of the oil to scavenge the relatively stable radical; 1,1-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-10-01066" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The scavenging of the free radicals of DPPH causes a color change of the initial solution from dark purple to yellow following the reduction of DPPH to DPPH-H (diphenyl-picrylhydrazine). Five milliliters of a freshly prepared ethanolic solution of DPPH (0.004%), 50 µL of various concentrations of each EO (2000–44,000 µg/mL) and of each standard (5–16,000 µg/mL) were added. The mixtures are vortexed and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. The disappearance of DPPH was followed spectrophotometrically at 517 nm against a blank (ethanol solution) using a spectrophotometer (JASCO-V53).
