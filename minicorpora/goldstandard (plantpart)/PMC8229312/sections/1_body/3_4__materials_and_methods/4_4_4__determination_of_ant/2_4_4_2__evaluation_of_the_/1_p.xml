<p>The β-carotene/linoleic acid method is one of the complementary methods used for screening of antioxidant substances. It is based on the principle that the unsaturated fatty acid, linoleic acid, spontaneously oxidizes with the reactive oxygen species (ROS) present in oxygen-rich water. Then the reaction products trigger the transformation of β-carotene into its colorless form. The degree of discoloration is measured spectrophotometrically and used as an estimate for antioxidant activity (AA) [

The stock solution of β-carotene/linoleic acid emulsion mixture was prepared as follows: 1.0 mg of β-carotene crystals was dissolved in 10 mL of chloroform and 1 mL of this solution was transferred to a flask containing 20 mg of linoleic acid and 200 mg of Tween-40. After complete removal of chloroform by evaporation (using a rotary evaporator at 40 °C), 50 mL of distilled hydrogen peroxide was added with vigorous stirring to form an emulsion. Five milliliters of the emulsion was added to 0.2 mL of the antioxidant solution in test tubes, containing 350 µL of EO diluted in ethanol. The final concentration was 2 g/L. The solution was homogenized, and absorbance measurements were taken at 470 nm immediately after the addition of the emulsion to the antioxidant solution. After vigorous shaking, the tubes were incubated at 50 °C for 2 h with shaking, absorbance measurements were taken at 15 min intervals until the absorbance of the read control got below 0.03. All determinations were made with three repetitions.
