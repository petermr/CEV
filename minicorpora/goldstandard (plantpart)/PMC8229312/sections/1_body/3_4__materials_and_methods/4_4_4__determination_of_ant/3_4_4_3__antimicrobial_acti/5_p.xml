<p>Ampicillin and nalidixic acid (30 μg/disk) were used as positive reference standards to determine the sensitivity of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria species, respectively. Nystatin (30 μg/disk) was used as positive reference standard to determine the sensitivity of fungi and yeasts species. The plates were kept at 4 °C for 2 h to allow diffusion, and then incubated for 24 h at 37 °C for bacteria, and 48 h at 30 °C for yeasts and fungi. The antimicrobial activity was determined by measuring with a caliper the diameters of inhibition zones, including disk diameter (6 mm). All tests were carried out in triplicate [
