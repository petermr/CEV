<p>The paper-disk diffusion method [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-10-01066" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] was employed for the determination of antimicrobial activity of the essential oil. Microbial suspensions were prepared in sterile 0.9% saline and adjusted as inoculum to a final concentration of 1.0 × 108 CFU/mL. A volume of 20 mL of Mueller–Hinton agar and Sabouraud, respectively, for bacterial and fungal strains was inoculated with 20 μL of microbial suspension and then poured into a Petri dish. The plates were left at room temperature for 30 min to allow the culture media to solidify. Each paper disk of 6 mm diameter was impregnated with 35 μg of essential oil solution (in methanol) and then applied manually on the surface of the agar plates inoculated with microorganisms.
