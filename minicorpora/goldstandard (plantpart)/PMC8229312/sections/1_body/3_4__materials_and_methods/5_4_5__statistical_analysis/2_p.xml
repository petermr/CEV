<p>The study used among others mean, range: minimum and maximum, standard deviation, relative statistical deviation (RSD) and coefficients of variability (CV). The results of examining some features were subjected to regression analysis, i.e., regression models were created. The idea of regression is to forecast data for a certain variable based on other variables. With the help of regression analysis, regression models were constructed, which will predict the value or level of a given feature with the assumed statistical error. Using the least squares method, regression lines and trend lines for the collected data were determined and used to estimate both linear and nonlinear relationships. Function parameters were determined using the least-squares method, and the significance was verified with Studentâ€™s
