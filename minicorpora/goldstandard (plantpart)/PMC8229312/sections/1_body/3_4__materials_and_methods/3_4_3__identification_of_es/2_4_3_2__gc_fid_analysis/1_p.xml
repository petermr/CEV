<p>A Hewlett Packard HP5890 series II GC-FID system was used for chromatography analysis, fitted with a fused silica capillary column with apolar stationary phase HP5MS (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness) and polar stationary phase HPWax (30 m × 0.15 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness). The temperature program was 60 °C for 5 min increased at 3 °C/min to 250 °C for 5 min. Injection was performed at 250 °C in the split mode; 1/50. 0.1 μL of the oil was injected. A flow rate of 1 mL/min carrier gas (N
 <sub>2</sub>) was used.
