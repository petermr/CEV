<p>The volatile compounds were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Analysis was performed on a GC/MS Hewlett Packard HP5890 series II chromatograph coupled to a HP MSD5971 mass spectrometer using fused-silica-capillary column. Thenon-polar column was DB5 (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm film thickness). GC-MS spectra were obtained using the following conditions: He (Helium) as carrier gas at flow rate of 1 mL/min; split mode 1:50; 0.1µL as injected volume; 250 °C as injection temperature. The oven temperature program was 60 °C for 5 min increasing at 3 °C/min towards 250 °C and held at 250 °C for 10 min. The ionization mode used was electronic impact at 70 eV. The identification was confirmed by comparison of the mass spectral with those stored in the MS database (National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST08 and Wiley libraries) and also by comparison with mass spectra from literature data [
