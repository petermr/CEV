 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> essential oil has been reported to be medicinal [

 <xref rid="B17-plants-10-01066" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Essential oils are concentrated hydrophobic oils that contain some volatile chemical compounds which are sensitive to light, temperature, oxygen and moisture [
 <xref rid="B18-plants-10-01066" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It can be extracted from plants by distillation, solvent extraction, oil absolute extraction and the use of resin binder or by cold pressing [

 <xref rid="B21-plants-10-01066" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. EO is used in industry where it is added to food, and in the perfume or cosmetics industry for its scents or fragrances [

 <xref rid="B25-plants-10-01066" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The medicinal features of EOs are varied. Based on this, EOs are best classified or grouped based on their plant sources. For instance, it is more useful and distinguishing to say EO of chamomile, EO of peppermint, EO of tea tree, EO of lavender or EO of 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic>. EOs are not all the same, the biochemical properties of an EO are a direct reflection of the plant secondary metabolite composition. Again, the commercially available EOs even from the same plant sources may differ in composition. This is because the end product of an EO is affected by the choice of extraction method and solvents, the carrier oil used, the method and duration of storage, and environmental factors [

 <xref rid="B27-plants-10-01066" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Adding EOs to a carrier oil such as vegetable oil, olive oil, coconut oil, castor oil, rosemary oil or other kinds of oil entails that the EO will no longer be pure and that its effects will be a sum of the total secondary metabolites in both the EO and the carrier oil.
