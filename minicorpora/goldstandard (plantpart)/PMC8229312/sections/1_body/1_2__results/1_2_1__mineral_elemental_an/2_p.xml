<p>In order to ensure that quality of analytical data and chemical element contents were attained, we used two standards (GSV-4 GBW 07605 and NIST-SRM 1573a) [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-10-01066" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The mineral chemical elementsâ€™ contents of the standards were measured in order to evaluate the technique performance. 
 <xref rid="plants-10-01066-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="plants-10-01066-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> represent a comparison between determined values and certified values of these standards. In most cases herein, the determined values on this step were within 10% range of those of the certified values. Furthermore, this evaluation showed significant quality of results as revealed by the statistical evaluation, where U-score values were all accepted.
