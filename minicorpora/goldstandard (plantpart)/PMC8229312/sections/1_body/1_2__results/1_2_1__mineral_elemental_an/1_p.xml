<p>To our knowledge and until now, there are no scientific researches issued focusing on the multielement (mineral compounds) composition of 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> despite the importance of trace elements in various human metabolic processes and their contribution of significantly to human health [
 <xref rid="B30-plants-10-01066" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], the present work attempts to fill that gap using the high detectability instrumental neutron activation analysis technique (INAA). The mineral content of an Algiers 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> sample was determined using the INAA technique. It was found to contain 18 elements, which include both macro- and microelements (As, Br, K, La, Na, Sb, Sm, Ba, Ca, Ce, Co, Cr, Cs, Fe, Rb, Sc, Th, and Zn).
