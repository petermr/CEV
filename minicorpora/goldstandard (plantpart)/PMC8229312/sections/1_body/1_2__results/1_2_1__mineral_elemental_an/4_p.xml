<p>Precision means the closeness of agreement between single analytical results (scattering of results) when a given procedure is applied to multiple, independent, homogeneous determinations on a homogeneous sample. The most common measures of precision are standard deviation (S), relative standard deviation (RSD) or coefficient of variation (V). Precision includes two concepts: repeatability and reproducibility. Acceptance criteria: The CV of the results of the ingredient content should not be greater than 3%. The CV of the results at the trace level should not be greater than 15%. The difference between two independent results must not exceed the values given in the accuracy tables. Both measurements are valid with a 95% probability. This means that on average when 20 determinations are performed, only one outlier can be acceded. Interlaboratory variability, defined as the coefficient of variation R or RSD%, is the most frequently used qualitative parameter to compare the accuracy of analytical methods. In general, typically the RSD% decreases exponentially with increasing concentration of the measured variable. In methods of analyzing the main ingredients of food, which are in the range from 0.01 g·100 g
 <sup>−1</sup> to 10 g·100 g
 <sup>−1</sup>, the coefficient of variation ranges from 0.1–10%. The greater the RSD% for the value, the poorer the repeatability of the method. To compare the performance of the methods in turn, the extreme RSD% values for each method in the team studies are summarized (
