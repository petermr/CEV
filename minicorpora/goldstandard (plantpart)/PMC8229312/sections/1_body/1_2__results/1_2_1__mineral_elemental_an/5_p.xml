<p>Reproducibility allows you to assess whether a given method leads to the same results in different laboratories with different analysts on different equipment and under different conditions, of course with the parameters in the description of the method. The tests are carried out in the same way as in the case of repeatability. The mean value, confidence interval, standard deviation, relative standard deviation and coefficient of variation of the obtained results are determined.</p>
