<p>The EO of 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> also showed good antiyeast activity against 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> that is pathogenic to humans. The phytopathogenic fungi tested, 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum albedinis</italic> and 
 <italic>Fusarium oxyspourum lini</italic> are the agents of 
 <italic>Fusarium wilt</italic> of date palm and flax, respectively. The research of the antifungal activity showed that the EOs from 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> are more potent (20–50 mm) than Nystatin (20–24 mm), which our reference antifungal used (
