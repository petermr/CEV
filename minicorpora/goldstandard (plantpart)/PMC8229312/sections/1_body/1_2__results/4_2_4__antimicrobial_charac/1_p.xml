<p>Antimicrobial activity was evaluated with respect to EO of 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> leaves by the paper disc diffusion method. The results showed that 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> EO has antibacterial activities (
 <xref rid="plants-10-01066-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). The EO showed strong activity against all strains tested with very low zones of inhibition (10 mm) for Gram-positive bacteria 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> from 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> EO. For pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria, zones of inhibition were observed, which ranged between 10â€“50 mm. In general, the EOs were more active against Gram-negative bacteria than Gram-positive bacteria (
