<p>Regression analysis creates a mathematical function that describes the relationship between the predictor (s) and the dependent variable. The coefficient of determination informs us what part of the variability (variance) of the explained variable in the sample coincides with the correlations with the variables included in the model. It is therefore a measure of the extent to which the model fits into the sample. The coefficient of determination assumes values in the range (0; 1) if there is an intercept in the model, and the method of least squares is used to estimate the parameters. Its values are most often expressed as a percentage.</p>
