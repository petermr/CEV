<p>The regression model for EO of 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic>, was determined according to the second degree curvilinear parabolic equation the second degree curvilinear parabolic equation (y = 3 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup> x
 <sup>2</sup> − 0.0071x + 0.5473a), with the coefficient of determination R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9989. This means that the regression equation is highly reliable (99.89% confidence) and you can trust the calculation.
