<p>That research showed, that EO has a weak antioxidant activity. It was shown on the basis of high IC
 <sub>50</sub> value (&gt;44,000 µg/mL), compared to Vitamin C (7.250 ± 0.030 µg/mL) and E (9.560 ± 0.070 µg/mL). EO of 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> inhibits in a less efficient way compared to the oxidation of linoleic acid by BHT. Therefore, the EO of 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> tested has less inhibition (AA = 15.860 ± 0.700%), compared to the oxidation of the β-carotene/linoleic acid as system of the reference substances (BHT with AA activity of 83.560 ± 2.130%) (
