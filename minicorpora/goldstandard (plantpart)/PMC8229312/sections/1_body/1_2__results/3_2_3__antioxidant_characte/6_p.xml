<p>The coefficient of determination denoted as R
 <sup>2</sup> indicates the accuracy of modeling, the actual data points by the regression equation. The value of the R
 <sup>2</sup> coefficient is a number between 0 and 1, where values closer to 1 indicate greater accuracy of the model. The value of the R
 <sup>2</sup> coefficient equal 1, which notes a perfect model, very unlikely in real situations, considering the complexity of interdependencies between various factors and unknown variables. Therefore, regression models were created with the highest possible value of the R
 <sup>2</sup> coefficient, with a value close to 1.
