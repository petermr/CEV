<p>In this test β-carotene/linoleic acid method, the ability of the EO of 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> and the standard (BHT) to slow the rate of lipid oxidation were evaluated by measuring the decrease in absorbance over time (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-01066-f002">Figure 2</xref>). BHT and EO are able to inhibit β-carotene bleaching by scavenging free radicals derived from linoleic acid. After 120 min, the absorbance of the control at 470 nm decreased, but this decrease was less rapid than in the OE tested.
