 <p>This study describes the minerals elements, chemical composition, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of Algerian 
  <italic>Melissa officinalis</italic> plant. The essential oil (EO) was extracted by hydrodistillation (HD) using a Clevenger-type apparatus of dry leaves of 
  <italic>M. officinalis</italic> and was analyzed by two techniques, gas chromatography coupled with flame ionization (GC-FID) and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Eighteen minerals comprising both macro- and microelements (As, Br, K, La, Na, Sb, Sm, Ba, Ca, Ce, Co, Cr, Cs, Fe, Rb, Sc, Th, and Zn) were determined using neutron activation analysis technique for the first time from Algerian 
  <italic>Melissa officinalis</italic> plant. Seventy-eight compounds were identified in the essential oil, representing 94.090% of the total oil and the yields were 0.470%. The major component was geranial (45.060%). Other predominant components were neral (31.720%) and citronellal (6.420%). The essential oil presented high antimicrobial activity against microorganisms, mainly five human pathogenic bacteria, one yeast, 
  <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, and two phytopathogenic fungi. The results can be used as a source of information for the pharmaceutical industry and medical research.
