<p>Plant-derived allelochemicals are beneficial agents in controlling pests. As we know, the plant kingdom mainly depends on secondary metabolites to defend against herbivores. With this knowledge in mind, scientists exploit the use of secondary plant chemicals for pest control. One of the main reasons for this increased demand is that the plant-originated chemicals are comparatively safer for humans and the environment. Our study’s results clearly document that the essential oil of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> flowers is toxic to larval mulberry pyralid and disrupt its various physiological systems in a way that the insect can hardly get resistance to it. Consequently, this wild-growing plant in Iran can be considered an efficient natural source capable of controlling insect pests. To apply the research results, it is recommended to evaluate the possible side effects of essential oil on mulberry and the biological control agents in future research. Regarding the insect pest’s resistance, identifying specific modes of action of essential oil active components and their overlapping with other insecticides should also be assessed.
