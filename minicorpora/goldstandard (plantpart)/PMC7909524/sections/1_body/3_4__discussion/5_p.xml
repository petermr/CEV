<p>Insect cellular immunity is considered as the main system challenging natural enemies entering the insect body [
 <xref rid="B52-foods-10-00210" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The immunocytes provide the insect ability to combat invading organisms by several means including phagocytosis, nodulation, and encapsulation [

 <italic>G. pyloalis</italic> larvae treated with 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> essential oil in the present study, could cause larvae to become susceptible to any invasion [

 <xref rid="B55-foods-10-00210" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The reduced number of hemocytes is mostly due to cytotoxic effect of the botanicals used [
 <xref rid="B56-foods-10-00210" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. We do believe this toxic effect of botanicals to be more reliable as a reasoning for the reduction of immunocytes [
