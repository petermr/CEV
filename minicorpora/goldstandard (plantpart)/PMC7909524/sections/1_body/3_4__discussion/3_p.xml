<p>Protein plays a key role in digestion, metabolism, and also energy conversion. Klowden (2007) [
 <xref rid="B49-foods-10-00210" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] believes that reduction in the insect’s protein content after applying biopesticides may stem from the reduction of growth hormone level. We observed a reduction in protein content and also retardation in growth; however, growth hormone level was not worked out. Lipids are other important macromolecules that help the insect reserve energy from feeding. They play a key role in insects’ intermediary metabolism and, therefore, they are essential in insect physiology [

 <italic>G. pyloalis</italic> larvae treated with 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> essential oil was observed in the present study. There are several reasons for reducing insect lipid content after treatments by toxins, alteration in lipid synthesis patterns, and hormonal dysfunction to control its metabolism [

 <italic>A. annua</italic> essential oil. This reduction could be related to reduced feeding following treatment, since the essential oil acts as a deterrent [

A reduction in protein, lipid, and glucose contents may have adverse effects on the reproductive parameters such as egg production, fertility, and fecundity [
