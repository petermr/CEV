Although 1,8-cineole (6.8%), camphor (13.1%), and artemisia ketone (11.8%) were also identified as main compounds in the essential oil extracted from 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> flowers, some other terpenes such as β-selinene (10.7%), pinocarvone (7.4%), and α-pinene (5.9%) had high amounts. However, a range of minor constituents, including compounds from ester and phenylpropene groups, were also recognized. Such differences can be caused by exogenous and endogenous factors, including geographic location, harvesting time, and the growth stage of plants [

For example, the promising insecticidal effects of terpenes like camphor and 1,8-cineole identified and extracted from essential oils were reported [
