<p>Our study clearly showed decreased enzymatic activity in 
 <italic>G. pyloalis</italic> larvae related to ingestion of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> essential oil-treated mulberry leaves. Our findings support earlier findings where disruption in insects’ physiology and their inability to digest food was reported [

 <xref rid="B44-foods-10-00210" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Reduction in α-amylase, protease, and α- and β-glucosidase, and disruptions on immunology and digestive system in the larvae and the ovary of emerged adults of 
 <italic>G. pyloalis</italic> were described in our results. Such activities are common for botanical insecticides against several insect pests [
