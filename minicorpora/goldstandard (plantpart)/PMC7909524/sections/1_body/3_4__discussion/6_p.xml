<p>Phenol oxidase system is considered as the key component in the immune system of insect and a bridge in the gap between cellular and humeral insect immunity. Its action is critically required in the last stage of cellular defense in order to form melanization, a process that terminates the action and kills the pathogenic agent. Phenol oxidase inhibition, documented for
