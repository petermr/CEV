<p>The histological texture of larval midgut upon treatment with 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> essential oil revealed significant differences with the controls, the most significant of which was the elongation and separation of epithelial cells losing the compactness (

The most significant changes in ovarian structure was thinning of epithelial cells around each follicle compared with that of control. Also, the significant reduction in cytoplasm was seen after vacuolization in yolk spheres of the oocytes (
