<p>Based on oral and fumigant bioassays, 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> essential oil was toxic to 4th instar larva of 
 <italic>G. pyloalis</italic> 24 h post treatments. Probit analysis revealed that the LC
 <sub>50</sub> values were 1.204 % W/V and 3.343 Î¼L/L air for oral and fumigant toxicity, respectively. The mortality of tested larvae was augmented with increasing concentration (

 <sub>50</sub>, the LC
 <sub>10</sub> and LC
 <sub>30</sub> values were used to evaluate sublethal bio-activities, including effects on energy reserves, digestive and detoxifying enzymes activity, and hematological and immunity responses and histological study of midgut and ovary of larvae (
