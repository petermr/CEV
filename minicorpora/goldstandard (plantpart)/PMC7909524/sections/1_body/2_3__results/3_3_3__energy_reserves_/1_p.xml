<p>The essential oil of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> flowers on the energy reserves of 
 <italic>G. pyloalis</italic> larvae is shown in 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00210-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. As can be seen, for all macromolecules, increasing dose of essential oil decreased the concentrations of protein, glucose, and triglycerides. For example, doubling the essential oil concentration (LC
 <sub>10</sub> to LC
 <sub>50</sub>) reduced glucose by 29% in oral tests, while a 1.7-fold increase in fumigant concentration resulted in a 32% drop in glucose levels. The protein was also affected but the decrease in protein with increasing essential oil levels was insufficient to detect given background variability.
