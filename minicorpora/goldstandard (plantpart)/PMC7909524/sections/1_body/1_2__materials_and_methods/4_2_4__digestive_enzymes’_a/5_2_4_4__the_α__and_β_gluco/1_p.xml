<p>Here, we used Triton X-100 in order to hydrolyze glucosidases (α- and β-) for 20 h at 40 °C in a ratio of 10 mg of Triton X-100/mg protein. Then, we incubated 75 mL p-nitrophenyl-α-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside (pNaG, 5 mM), p-nitrophenyl-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside (pNbG, 5 mM), 125 mL universal buffer (made of 2%Mol MES (2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid), glycine, and succinate, 100 mM, pH 5.0), and 50 mL enzyme solution. In order to stop the reaction, 2 mL of sodium carbonate (1 M) was used and the absorbance was read at 450 nm [
