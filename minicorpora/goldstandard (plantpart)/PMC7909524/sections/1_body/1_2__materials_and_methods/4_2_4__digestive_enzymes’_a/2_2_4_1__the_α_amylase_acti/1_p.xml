<p>The reagent dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS, Sigma, St. Louis, MI, USA) in 1% soluble starch was used to estimate α-amylase activity according to the method of Bernfeld (1955) [
 <xref rid="B21-foods-10-00210" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Briefly, 20 µL of the enzyme was poured into 40 μL of soluble starch and 100 μL of universal buffer (pH 7). The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 35 °C, and DNS (100 μL) was then added to stop the reaction. The absorbance was read at 540 nm in an ELISA reader (Awareness, Temecula, CA, USA).
