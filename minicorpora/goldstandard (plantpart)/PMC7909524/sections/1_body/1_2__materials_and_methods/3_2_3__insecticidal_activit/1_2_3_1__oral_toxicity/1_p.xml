<p>Initial tests were conducted to assist in selecting the appropriate range of concentrations. Bioassays were carried out on 4
 <sup>th</sup> instar larvae, which were deprived of nutrition for 4 h before the onset of experiments. The essential oil concentrations of 0.5, 0.7, 1, 1.4 and 2% (
 <italic>W</italic>/
 <italic>V</italic>) in acetone as solvent (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were selected. For bioassays, mulberry leaf disks (8 cm in diameter) were immersed in desired concentrations for 10 s and then air-dried at room temperature for 30 min. Ten 4th instar 
 <italic>G. pyloalis</italic> were placed on each disk. The mortality was documented after 24 h. Control groups were placed on disks treated with acetone. The control and treated groups were replicated four times.
