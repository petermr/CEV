<p>In order to carry out fumigation bioassays, two transparent polyethylene plastic containers (Pharman polymer company, Rasht, Iran) were used. A 250-mL container was used to place 10 4th instar larvae of mulberry pyralid. They were provided with fresh mulberry leaf disks, and the container top was covered with fine cotton fabric for aeration. The container was then placed inside a 1000-mL container. The desired amount of pure essential oil was poured onto filter papers (Whatman No. 1) cut to 2 cm in diameter using a micro applicator. It was then placed in the corner of the larger container, and its lid tightly sealed using Parafilm. The concentrations of 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 ÂµL/L air were used for this bioassay based on the initial tests. The controls were treated in the same way without any treatments of the filter papers. All tests were replicated four times. </p>
