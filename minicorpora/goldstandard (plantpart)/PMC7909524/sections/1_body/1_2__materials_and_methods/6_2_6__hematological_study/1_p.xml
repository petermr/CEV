<p>The amount of various circulating blood cells in mm
 <sup>−3</sup> of larval lesser mulberry pyralid treated with sublethal doses of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> oil and in controls were assessed. The hemolymph was drawn from one of the larval prolegs, cutting by a fine scissor, using a capillary glass tube (10 µL for each treatment). Then, the blood was diluted five times with a solution of anticoagulant (0.017 M EDTA, 0.186 M NaCl, 0.098 M NaOH, and 0.041 M citric acid at pH 4.5). An improved Neubauer hemocytometer (mlabs, HBG, Giessen, Germany) [

 <xref rid="B31-foods-10-00210" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A drop of hemolymph was collected from cut proleg of treated and control larvae. A smear was formed and stained with diluted Giemsa (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in distilled water (1:9) for 25 min, then just dipped in a saturated solution of lithium carbonate, and, finally, washed with distilled water. Permanent slides were prepared in Canada balsam (Merck Darmstadt, Germany). The percentage profile of different cells was done after identification and counting of 200 cells per slide [
