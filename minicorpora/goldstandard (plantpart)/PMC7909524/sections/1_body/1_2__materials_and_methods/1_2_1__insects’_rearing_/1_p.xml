 <italic>G. pyloalis</italic> were handpicked from a mulberry orchard within the University of Guilan campus, Rasht (37.2682° N, 49.5891° E), Iran. The larvae were maintained on fresh leaves of ‘Shin Ichinoise’ mulberry variety in disposable transparent containers (high-density polyethylene plastic containers, 10 × 20 × 5 cm) in a rearing room set at 25 ± 1 °C, 75 ± 5% RH (Relative Humidity), and 16:8 L:D (Light:Dark). The emerging adults were reserved in glass jars (18 × 7 × 5 cm), in which fresh leaves were positioned for egg laying, and 10% honey-soaked cotton wool was provided for feeding.
