 <xref rid="B25-foods-10-00210" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], using the kit (GDA01A, Biochem Co., Tehran, Iran), was incorporated, while glucose and triglyceride were measured by Siegert (1987) [
 <xref rid="B26-foods-10-00210" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] method and the triglyceride diagnostic kit, respectively (Pars Azmoon Co., Tehran, Iran). Key enzymes including esterase (general esterases with α- and β-naphthyl acetate substrates), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and phenol oxidase (PO) were assessed by the method described by van Asperen (1962) [
