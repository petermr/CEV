<p>The mature and immature flowers of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> (autumn 2018) were collected on the University of Guilan campus. Samples were dried on a table out of direct sunlight for about a week until sufficiently dry to form a powder when ground. The dried flowers were made into a fine powder by a grinder (354, Moulinex, Normandy, France), and a solution was made with distilled water (50 g/750 mL). The solution was let to stand in the dark at laboratory room temperature for 24 h to maximum essential oil extraction. The mixture was distilled to extract the essential oil using a Clevenger apparatus (J3230, Sina glass, Tehran, Iran). The distillation process was run for two hours and the obtained essential oil was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The obtained essential oil was stored in dark glass vials at 4 Â°C in a refrigerator until used.
