<p>The essential oil was analyzed through gas chromatography (Agilent Technologies 7890B) coupled with a mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies 5977A), which was armed with an HP-5MS ((5%-phenyl)-methylpolysiloxane) capillary column with a 30-m length, 0.25-mm width, and an internal thickness of 0.25 µm. Helium gas at a 1 mL/min flow rate was used, while the column temperature started from 50 and reached to 280 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min. A 10%
