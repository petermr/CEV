<p>The evaluation of lethal (acute) and sublethal (chronic) effects of essential oil extracted from 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> flowers on 
 <italic>G. pyloalis</italic> was the main objective of the current study, recommending a biorational and available agent as a possible replacement for synthetic insecticides. Fumigant toxicity is considered to be a non-residual treatment in which no residue will commonly remain for future contaminants. In oral toxicity, the pest is eliminated by swallowing infested food, and it is a suitable method for controlling leaf-eating pests. Therefore, fumigant and oral toxicity and the effect on some key enzymes and biochemical compounds, immunology, digestive system in the larvae, and the ovary of emerged adults of insects, along with the chemical analysis of the essential oil, were evaluated.
