<p>The podophyllotoxin analysis was essentially performed as described previously [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-26-03659" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], with a few modifications. The HPLC analysis was performed using an Agilent 1260 series system and an Agilent Eclipse XDB-C18, 4.6 mm × 150 mm, 5 µm column. The injection volume for all of the samples and for the podophyllotoxin standard was 10 µL. The analytical method was isocratic (28:72% acetonitrile:deionized water with 0.1% TFA) for 20 min. The analytes were detected at 220 nm. The podophyllotoxin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). The response factors were calculated using the equation RF = DR/C, where DR was the detector response in the peak area (PA) and C was the podophyllotoxin concentration. Confirmed integrated peaks were used to determine the percentage of podophyllotoxin in the extract. The RF of the target chemical constituent was used to determine the “percent” for each sample using the equation PA/RF/C × 100 = % (peak area/response factor/concentration) in the plant tissue (
