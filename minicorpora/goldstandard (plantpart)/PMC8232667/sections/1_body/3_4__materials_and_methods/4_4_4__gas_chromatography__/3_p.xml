<p>The components present in the EO samples were identified using the mass spectra library NISTâ€™08, and were compared with the literature data [
 <xref rid="B91-molecules-26-03659" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. A mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons (C
 <sub>8</sub>-C
 <sub>40</sub>) was used to calculate the relative retention indices, under the same conditions mentioned above. The normalization method of the GC/FID peak areas was used to determine the percentage ratio of the EO components.
