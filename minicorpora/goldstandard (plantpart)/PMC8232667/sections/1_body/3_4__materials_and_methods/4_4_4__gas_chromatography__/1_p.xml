<p>The 
 <italic>J. excelsa</italic> and 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic> EOs in three replications were analyzed for their chemical composition by GC-FID and GC/MS, as described previously [
 <xref rid="B83-molecules-26-03659" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Briefly, the GC/MS analysis was performed using a 7890A gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) and a 5975C mass selective detector equipped with a DB-5MS capillary column with dimensions of 30 m length, 0.32 mm inner diameter and 0.25 µm film tickness (JW, Agilent) at the following temperature program: initially 60 °C for 3 min, then 1 °C/min to 80 °C (held) for 3 min, and finally 5 °C/min 280 °C (held for 5 min). The flow rate of the helium (carrier gas) was set at 1.0 mL/min. MS parameters: the ionization voltage was 70 eV; the temperatures of the ion source and transfer line were 230 and 280 °C, respectively; solvent delay 4.25 min, mass range: 50–550 Da, scan mode. In total, 1 μL EO (10%,
