<p>Two separate studies were conducted and described in this manuscript: (1) the objective of the first study was to assess the variability in the EO profile and podophyllotoxin concentration of 
 <italic>Juniperus sabina</italic> and 
 <italic>J. excelsa,</italic> depending on the location and sex of the tree; (2) the objective of the second experiment was to assess the effect of the EO extraction (hydrodistillation using a Clevenger-type apparatus vs. steam distillation in a semi-commercial extractor) on the EO profile and bioactivity of 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic> and 
 <italic>J. excelsa</italic>.
