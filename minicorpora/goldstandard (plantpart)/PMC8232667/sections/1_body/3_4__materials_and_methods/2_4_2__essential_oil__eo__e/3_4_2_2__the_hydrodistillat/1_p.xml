<p>The second experiment also used air-dried biomass samples of 
 <italic>J. excelsa</italic> (collected at IG Krichim in the Rhodope Mountains) and 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic> (collected above the village of Beli Iskar in the Rila Mountains). The EO from the second experiment was extracted at the Research Institute for Roses, Essential Oils and Medicinal Plants in the town of Kazanluk, Bulgaria through hydrodistillation. The hydrodistillation was performed in a Clevenger apparatus using 100 g air-dried samples and 800 mL water. The biomass samples were mixed in a blender in order to disrupt the EO cavities and the samples were extracted for 3 h in two replicates.
