<p>All of the juniper biomass samples were dried in a shady area at a temperature below 38 °C to avoid EO losses. The EO was extracted by hydrodistillation at the University of Food Technologies in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, following a procedure described previously [
 <xref rid="B83-molecules-26-03659" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. The subsamples for the distillation consisted of 100 g air-dried leaves, which were cut in 5 mm pieces immediately prior to the distillation. The ratio of the biomass to water was 1:10, so we used 1000 mL water for each sample. The cutting of the leaves was performed in order to facilitate the EO extraction, as juniper EO is synthesized and stored in endogenic cavities (

The cutting was based on preliminary studies and previous reports indicating that if the juniper leaves are distilled without being cut, the distillation process may need to continue for over 10–12 h to extract all of the the EO [
