<p>The repellent effect of EOs of 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic> (F, M) and 
 <italic>J. excelsa</italic> against 
 <italic>Rh. padi</italic> and 
 <italic>S. avenae</italic> were assessed using assays in Petri dishes. The EOs were used in six concentrations: 1, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5 and 5%, in three replicates. The EOs were diluted an aqueous solution with an emulsifier, 0.1% Polysorbate 80. In total, 2 µL of each solution (1, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5 and 5%) was applied directly to a 5 cm length of the leaves of 
 <italic>H. vulgare</italic> Jess. subsp. 
 <italic>distichum</italic> L., var. Erectum, cv Obzor. The leaves were dried at room temperature (about 25 °C) for 10 min and placed in Petri dishes on a wet laboratory filter paper disk. One treated leaf, one untreated leaf, plus 10 wingless aphids were introduced into each Petri dish. Then, the Petri dishes were covered with cheesecloth (44 g/m
 <sup>2</sup>). The repellent effect was observed after 24 h. The repellency of the tested EO was expressed as the number of aphids that ascended at and remained on the treated leaves.
