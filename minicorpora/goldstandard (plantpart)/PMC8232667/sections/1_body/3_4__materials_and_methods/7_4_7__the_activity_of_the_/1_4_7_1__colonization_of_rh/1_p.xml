<p>The aphids 
 <italic>Rhopalosiphum padi</italic> and 
 <italic>Sitobion avenae</italic> were collected from cereal crops in the area of the town of Karnobat, Bulgaria (42°38′54.51″ N, 27°21′60.56″ E). The insects were reared on 
 <italic>Hordeum vulgáre</italic> Jess. subsp. 
 <italic>distichum</italic> L., var. Erectum, cv Obzor in pots with a diameter of 20 cm and a height of 25 cm. The aphids were colonized on the plants when the plants reached the third leaf stage. The aphid colony was maintained at a controlled temperature of 23–24 °C, 65% relative humidity and an 8:16 h (light: dark) period in the entomology laboratory of the Institute of Agriculture in Karnobat, Bulgaria. The wingless female aphids were used in the experiment.
