<p>The toxicity of three EO was tested on two aphid species: 
 <italic>S. avenae</italic> and 
 <italic>Rh. padi</italic>. The contact effect of the EO at 0, 1, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5 and 5% concentration solution against pests was evaluated on leaves of 
 <italic>H. vulgare</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>distichum</italic> var. Erectum, cv Obzor, in three replicates. The EOs were diluted in an aqueous solution with an emulsifier, 0.1% Polysorbate 80. The control (0%) was treated with 0.1% aqueous solution of Polysorbate 80. The leaves of 
 <italic>H. vulgare</italic> which developed colonies of aphids were cut and 2 ÂµL of each solution was applied directly over the adult wingless forms of the aphids. After the treatment, the leaves were dried on filter paper and transferred to Petri dishes [

 <sup>2</sup>). The effect of the application (knock-down or mortality) was observed after 24 h and after 72 h, and the treatment effects were compared with the controls. The effect of the EO application at different concentrations was calculated using the Henderson and Tilton formula:
