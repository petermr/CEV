<p>In this study, 100 µL of the bacterial suspension was spread on the Mueller Hinton Agar (MHA, Oxoid, UK). In this study, the agar disc diffusion method was used. In total, 6 mm diameter filter paper discs were used for the test. The filter paper was impregnated with 15 μL EO and placed on MHA with a bacterial inoculum. The MHA was maintained at 4 °C for 2 h and then at 37 °C for 24 h. After a 24 h incubation period, the diameter of the inhibition zones (in mm) was measured. The antibiotic chloramphenicol (30 μg per disc, Oxoid, UK) was used as a positive control for the bacterial growth. The antimicrobial activity was measured in triplicate.</p>
