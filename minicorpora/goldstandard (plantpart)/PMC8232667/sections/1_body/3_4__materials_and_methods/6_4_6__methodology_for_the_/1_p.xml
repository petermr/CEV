<p>The antioxidant capacity of the different juniper EOs was measured according to the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC oil) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Small Molecule Analysis Laboratory, using the method developed by Huang et al. [

 <xref rid="B93-molecules-26-03659" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Trolox®, (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid), a polar derivative of Vitamin E, was used as a standard. The EO samples were prepared by mixing 10 ± 1 mg oil with 1 mL water and acetone (1:1) with 7% methyl-β-cyclodextrins (

After that, the EO sample (25 μL) or Trolox® (25 μL) was added at concentration of 0.2, 0.4, 3.3, 6.5, 10, 13, 25 or 50 μg/mL, followed by 150 μL of fluorescein (8.16 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup> mM). Each sample was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, with 3 min alternating shaking. The reaction was activated by adding 153 mM 2, 2′-azobis (2-amidinopropane) hydrochloride (25 μL) to each well. The standards and tested EO were prepared in 96-well plates and monitored with a BMG Labtech FLUOstar Optima microplate reader (Durham, NC). We measured the fluorescence every 1.5 min at excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 nm and 520 nm, respectively, until the decreasing fluorescence values plateaued. The area under the curve was calculated. The results are reported as µmole Trolox® g
