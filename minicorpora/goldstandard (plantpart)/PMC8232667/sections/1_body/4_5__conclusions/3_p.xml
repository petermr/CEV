<p>The statistical analyses of the repellent effects of EO from 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic> (M, F) and 
 <italic>J. excelsa,</italic> and the concentration of the EO (1, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, and 5%) revealed a significant effect of the concentration on both aphid species (
 <italic>Sitobion avenae</italic> and 
 <italic>Rhopalosiphum padi</italic>). Overall, the number of aphids repelled increased with the increasing concentration of both EOs. The EO caused visible injuries on the leaves, such as scolding, as most EO are phytotoxic. Therefore, we suggest that whenever EOs are used to evaluate their activity against any organisms, the toxicity (or phytotoxicity) thresholds must be established first. The antimicrobial activity of the two juniper EOs did not differ against five microorganisms; however, overall, the strongest antimicrobial activity of both EOs was found against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic>. The EO from 
 <italic>J. excelsa</italic> without galbuli and 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic> (F) plants, obtained via Clevenger-type hydrodistillation, had the highest antioxidant capacity.
