<p>The extraction type (hydrodistillation using a Clevenger-type apparatus vs. steam distillation in a semi-commercial facility) did not significantly alter the EO composition. Overall, the EO profile of the two junipers and accessions was quite different and may be of interest to the EO industry utilizing juniper leaf essential oil. However, 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic> and 
 <italic>J. excelsa</italic> are protected species, and therefore their natural populations may not be utilized for the commercial production of EO of podophyllotoxin. Therefore, it is suggested that breeding and selection programs be developed with the two junipers to identify chemotypes with (1) a high EO content and desirable composition (in both junipers), and (2) a high concentration of podophyllotoxin in 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic>. Such chemotypes could eventually be developed into agricultural crops that can be used as a source for the commercial production of podophyllotoxin and EO.
