 <italic>J. excelsa</italic> (1.16%). The EO content in 
 <italic>J. excelsa</italic> varied from 0.69 to 1.87%, whereas the EO content in 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic> was 1.3–2.1%. The main EO constituents of 
 <italic>J. excelsa</italic> were α-cedrol (29.1–32.5%), α-limonene (24.1–26.4%) and α-pinene (19.7–22.5%), while those in
