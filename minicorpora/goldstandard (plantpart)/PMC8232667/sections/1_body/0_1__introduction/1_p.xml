Although most junipers are slow-growing trees and bushes, juniper wood is durable and valued for its color, aroma and antimicrobial properties. Furthermore, junipers are important for a number of wildlife species, especially in arid regions; they are also very widely used as ornamentals and as a source for natural plant products [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-03659" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Most junipers contain essential oil (EO) with a specific aroma, while some also contain podophyllotoxin [

 <xref rid="B4-molecules-26-03659" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], among other non-volatile compounds. The EO of some juniper species extracted from leaves, wood, or berries (galbuli) is used as a major aromatic agent in numerous consumer products [
