 <xref rid="molecules-26-03659-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Of the 36 EO constituents identified in 
 <italic>J. excelsa</italic> in this study, α-cedrol (24.06–27.00%) and α-limonene (23.23–27.50%) were the main ones, followed by α-pinene (18.90–22.30%). The other EO constituents with concentrations above 1% of the total oil included α-cedrene, β-caryophyllene, γ-elemene, germacrene D, δ-cadinene and 1-epi-cubenol (
