<p>The major classes of the 
 <italic>J. excelsa</italic> EO compounds from the second experiment were monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, both at around 50% of the total oil (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03659-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). The monoterpene hydrocarbons (about 49%) were the major portion of the total monoterpenes, with the oxygenated monoterpenes and the bicyclic oxygenated monoterpenes being very minor. The tricyclic oxygenated sesquiterpenes (25%) were the major percentage of the total sesquiterpenes; the other sesquiterpenes included oxygenated bicyclic sesquiterpenes (about 9%), bicyclic sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (about 7%), monocyclic sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (about 6%) and tricyclic sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (about 3%). The chemical classes were not very different between the Clevenger and semi-commercial extracted
