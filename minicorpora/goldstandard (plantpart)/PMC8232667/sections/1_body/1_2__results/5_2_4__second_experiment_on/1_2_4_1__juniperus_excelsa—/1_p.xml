<p>Most of the published research on the EO composition of 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic> and 
 <italic>J. excelsa</italic> used the hydrodistillation method using a Clevenger apparatus (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03659-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Indeed, this method has been a standard laboratory practice for a long time because of its simplicity and efficient EO extraction. However, the industry is extracting juniper EO using steam distillation due to the much wider availability of commercial steam distillation extraction facilities relative to hydrodistillation ones. Although there have been comparative studies between the two extraction methods for other aromatic plants [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-03659" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-03659" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], these have not been compared for the two juniper species subject to this study. Therefore, in order to test the hypothesis that the commonly used laboratory method (hydrodistillation method using a Clevenger apparatus) would provide a differential EO composition compared with the steam distillation used by the industry, we extracted subsamples from the same larger samples using both methods, as described in the Materials and Methods section.
