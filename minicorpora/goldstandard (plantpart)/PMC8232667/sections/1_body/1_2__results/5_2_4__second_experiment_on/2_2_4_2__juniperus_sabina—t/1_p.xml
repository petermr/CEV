<p>The 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic> EO profiles extracted via the Clevenger apparatus (hydrodistillation) and semi-commercial (steam distillation) were also very similar, thus refuting our hypothesis (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03659-t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>). Fourty-five (45) EO constituents were identified in 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic> from this second study, with the major one being sabinene (20.07–25.6%). The other EO constituents at &gt; 1% of the total oil included α-thujene (1.26–1.41%), α-pinene (2.72–5.88%), β-pinene (1.92–2.73%), limonene (1.01–1.82%), γ-terpinene (2.32–2.92%), terpinen-4-ol (3.83–6.39%), myrtenyl acetate (1.36–14.20%), methyl eugenol (1.95–5.89%), γ-cadinene (1.15–2.17%), δ-cadinene (2.35–9.31%), elemol (1.32–4.53%) and germacrene-D-4-ol (1.26–5.02%) (
