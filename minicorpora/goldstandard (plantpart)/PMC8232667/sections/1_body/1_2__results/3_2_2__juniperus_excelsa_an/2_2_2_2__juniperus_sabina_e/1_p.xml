<p>Forty six (46) EO constituents were identified in the 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic> samples collected in Bulgaria and Slovakia (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-03659">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Overall, the major EO constituents of 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic> were sabinene (16.68–30.98%), terpinen-4-ol (9.25–13.63%), myrtenyl acetate (1.32–23.02%), elemol (8.45–13.70%) and α-cadinol (3.47–3.77%). Other EO constituents which were above 1% of the total oil included α-thujene, α-pinene, p-cymene, limonene and δ-cadinene. The EO profile of 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic> from Slovakia was not very different; it was generally within the observed profile of the 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic> EO accessions from Bulgaria (
