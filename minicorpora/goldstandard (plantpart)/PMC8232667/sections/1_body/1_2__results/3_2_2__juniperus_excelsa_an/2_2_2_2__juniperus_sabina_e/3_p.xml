<p>The two major chemical classes of the EO constituents of 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic> were monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-03659">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). The monoterpenes were the highest in the EO from Zvolen, Slovakia, at 73.2%, while the total monoterpenes collected in Bulgaria were 61.3–70.6%. Of the total monoterpenes, the monoterpene hydrocarbons were the largest group (26.9–41.5%), followed by the oxygenated monoterpenes (15.6–36.5%). The total sesquiterpenes comprised 19.97–25.96% of the total oil, with the major ones being the monocyclic sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (10.5–15.9%), oxygenated bicyclic sesquiterpenes (5.4–5.8%) and bicyclic sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (3.5–3.8%) (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-03659">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). The phenylpropanoid compound (methyl eugenol) in the EO from the male plants collected in Beli Iskar Bulgaria was 13.5%, while its concentration in the EO of other 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic> samples was negligible, below 1% (
