<p>Overall, the two major classes of the 
 <italic>J. excelsa</italic> EO constituents were monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. The amount of monoterpenes was around 49.9–53.8% (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-03659">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Monoterpene hydrocarbons were the major part of the total monoterpenes, and oxygenated monoterpenes were present in relatively low concentrations of around 1%, with the exception of one of the samples, in which they reached 7.3%. The total sesquiterpenes were 44.4–48.2%. The total sesquiterpenes included tricyclic oxygenated sesquiterpenes as a major group, with monocyclic sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, bicyclic sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenatedbicyclic sesquiterpenes being in lower concentrations (
