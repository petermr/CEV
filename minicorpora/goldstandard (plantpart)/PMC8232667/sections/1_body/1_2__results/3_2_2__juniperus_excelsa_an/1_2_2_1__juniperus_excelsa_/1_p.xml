<p>Twenty nine (29) constituents were identified in 
 <italic>J. excelsa</italic> EO, and the range of each of these constituents is given in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-03659">Supplementary Table S1</xref>. Please note that while most junipers are dioecious, 
 <italic>J. excelsa</italic> is monoecious; however, some trees do form galbuli and other trees do not. This may be confusing, as in most other junipers that are dioecious, the female trees produce galbuli while the male trees do not. The EO yield of 
 <italic>J. excelsa</italic> collected at three different locations depending on the presence of galbuli varied from 0.69 to 1.87% in the dried material, with significant differences among the locations and depending on the presence of galbuli (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03659-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The three major EO constituents of 
 <italic>J. excelsa</italic> EO were α-cedrol (29.1–32.3%), α-limonene (24.1–26.4%) and α-pinene (19.7–22.5%) (
