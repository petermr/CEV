<p>Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was completed to determine the effect of Location–Sex of the 10 main constituents, namely: α-pinene, β-pinene, α-limonene, bornyl acetate, germacrene D, γ-cadinene, germacrene B, caryophyllene oxide, α-cedrol and 1-epi-cubenol (

The concentrations of α-pinene and α-limonene were the highest in the EO of plants without galbuli from Izgoryaloto Gyune, Rhodope Mountains, and α-limonene was not different from the EO of the plants with galbuli from Kresna Gorge (

The EO of the plants with galbuli from Kresna Gorge also had the highest concentrations of bornyl acetate, germacrene D, γ-cadinene, germacrene B, caryophyllene oxide and 1-epi-cubenol, whereas the EO of plants from Izgoryaloto Gyune in the Rhodope Mountains with galbuli contained the highest concentration of α-cedrol (
