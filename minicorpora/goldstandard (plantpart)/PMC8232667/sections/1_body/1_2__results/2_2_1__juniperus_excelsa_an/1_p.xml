<p>Overall, the EO yield of the dried leaves of 
 <italic>J. excelsa</italic> (1.16%) was lower than that of 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic> (1.98%) (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03659-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). However, the EO yield of both junipers varied among different accessions, from 0.60% to 1.87% in 
 <italic>J. excelsa</italic> and from 1.38% to 2.73% in 
 <italic>J. sabina,</italic> suggesting significant variability occurring within a population (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03659-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These results demonstrated that high- yielding EO accessions of the two junipers could be identified and selected from the natural populations for the potential commercial production of EO.
