<p>The antioxidant capacity of the EO from the two juniper species obtained by the two different modes of extraction (semi-commercial steam distillation and hydrodistillation via Clevenger apparatus) is shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03659-t011" ref-type="table">Table 11</xref>. The interaction effect of extraction method and species/galbuli/sex on ORAC was highly significant. Overall, when the semi-commercial steam distillation method was used, the EO from 
 <italic>J. excelsa</italic> with galbuli plants had a higher antioxidant capacity (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03659-t011" ref-type="table">Table 11</xref>), although this result is difficult to explain precisely. The highest antioxidant capacity was exhibited by the EO from 
 <italic>J. excelsa</italic> without galbuli and 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic> (F) plants, both obtained via Clevenger hydrodistillation. The difference in the antioxidant capacity of the EO may be due to their differential composition. We may only speculate here, as further research may need to be conducted to reveal the precise causes.
