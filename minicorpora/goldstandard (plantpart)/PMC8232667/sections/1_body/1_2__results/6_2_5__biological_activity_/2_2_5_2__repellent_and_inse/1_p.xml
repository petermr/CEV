<p>The analysis of variance results on the repellent and insecticidal effects of EO from juniper species 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic> (M, F) and 
 <italic>J. excelsa</italic> are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03659-t009" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref> and 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03659-t010" ref-type="table">Table 10</xref>. The concentration of the EO (1, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, and 5%) revealed a significant effect of the concentration on both aphid species (
 <italic>Sitobion avenae</italic> and 
 <italic>Rhopalosiphum padi</italic>). However, the main effect of the juniperâ€™s species and the junipers species by concentration interaction effect were not significant at the 5% level. This suggests that the repellent effect of EO concentration was consistent in 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic> and 
 <italic>J. excelsa</italic>, and that there was no difference between the two juniper species with respect to their repellency action. The mean mumber of aphids that remained on the leaves are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03659-t009" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>. The EO applied at 5% concentration had the strongest repellent action on both species of aphid. However, the 4.5% concentration rate had a stronger repellant effect on the 
 <italic>S. avenae</italic> aphid than on the 
 <italic>Rh. padi</italic> aphid. The two low (1% and 1.5%) concentraions did not have significantly different repellency on both species of aphid (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03659-t009" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>). Overall, the number of aphids repelled increased with the increasing concentration. Surely, as expected, the EO caused visible injuries on the leaves, such as scolding, as most EO are phytotoxic. Furthermore, further research at various concentrations may be needed to establish the exact phytotoxic effect of 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic> and 
 <italic>J. excelsa</italic> EO on barley leaves.
