<p>The EO of the two juniper species was tested for antimicrobial activity against 6 microorganisms using the disc diffusion method, as described in the Materials and Methods section. Overall, the EO of 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic> was more effective against HI CCM4457 than that of 
 <italic>J. excelsa</italic> (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03659-t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>). However, the antimicrobial activity of the EO of the two juniper species did not differ significantly against the other five microorganisms (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03659-t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>). In general, the best antimicrobial activity of both EOs was found against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic> (4.80 mm).
