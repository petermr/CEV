<p>Podophyllotoxin was first reported in 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic> in 1953 [
 <xref rid="B67-molecules-26-03659" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Hartwell et al. [
 <xref rid="B67-molecules-26-03659" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] reported a podophyllotoxin yield of 0.17% in a 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic> var. 
 <italic>tamsciscifolia</italic> male plant and 0.2% in the dried needles of ”Savin”, “stated by the supplier to be 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic>”, while in this study, the podophyllotoxin concentration ranged from 0.065% in accession # 77 to 0.320% in accession # 65 (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03659-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). These results are promising because the 0.32% podophyllotoxin in this study was the highest reported for podophyllotoxin in 
 <italic>J. sabina.</italic> Therefore, accession # 77 could potentially be used for the commercial production of podophyllotoxin. Interestingly, while several papers reported on the use of podophyllotoxin’s effects and mentioned that it can be obtained from 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic>, we were not able to identify any report where the podophyllotoxin yield of 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic> was actually reported since 1953 (for almost 68 years). This underlines the need for more research on the podophyllotoxin yield in 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic> accessions across the world.
