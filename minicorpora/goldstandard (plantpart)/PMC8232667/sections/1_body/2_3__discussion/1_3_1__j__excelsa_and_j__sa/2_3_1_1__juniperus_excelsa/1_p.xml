<p>In this study, the EO yield of the air-dried biomass varied from 0.69 to 1.87%. The highest EO of 
 <italic>J. excelsa</italic> was obtained from the samples collected in the reserve “Izgoryaloto Gyune” in the Rhodope Mountains. The EO yields of the samples from Bachkovo, Rhodope Mountains and the reserve “Tisata” in the Pirin Mountains were similar. The habitats of 
 <italic>J. excelsa</italic> in the reserve “Tisata” in the Pirin Mountains are under the influence of a Mediterranean climate, and in the other two locations (the reserve “Izgoryaloto Gyune” on Rodope mountain; Bachkovo, Rhodope Mountains) are under the influence of a temperate–continental climate [

The common denominator between the three habitats is that the species is spread on steep eroded slopes with southern and southeastern exposure, on limestone rocks. The soil layer at these locations is shallow. Previous research has demonstrated that the EO yield and composition may be influenced by the sampling time/season, the various ecological characteristics of the habitat, the sex of the plant and other factors [

 <xref rid="B30-molecules-26-03659" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The divergent results of the samples collected from populations with temperate–continental climates (the reserve “Izgoryaloto Gyune” in the Rhodope Mountains, and Bachkovo in the Rhodope Mountains), as well as the similar values of the samples under the influence of a Mediterranean climate (the reserve “Tisata” in the Pirin Mountains) suggest that the individual genetic characteristics of plants most probably predetermined the EO yield, rather than the differences in the ecology. Indeed, a significant diversity of EO yield and composition within one population was recently reported for 
 <italic>J. oxycedrus</italic> L. in Bulgaria [
