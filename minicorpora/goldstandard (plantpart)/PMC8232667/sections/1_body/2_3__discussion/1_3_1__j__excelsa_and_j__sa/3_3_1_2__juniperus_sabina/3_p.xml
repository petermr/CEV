<p>Terpinen-4-ol, (S)-(-)-citronellic acid, methyl ester, elemol and α-sadinol were also the main EO constituents in the samples in this study, and their amounts cannot be related to the type of habitat or the sex of the plant. It is noteworthy that myrtenyl acetate was found in higher concentration in a M sample from Slovakia (20.81%) and in one sample of an F plant from Beli Iskar, Bulgaria (23.02%); its concentration in the other samples was 1.32–2.78%. In general, this study found no large differences in 
 <italic>J. sabina’s</italic> EO content and composition depending on its habitat, and this refuted part of our working hypothesis.
