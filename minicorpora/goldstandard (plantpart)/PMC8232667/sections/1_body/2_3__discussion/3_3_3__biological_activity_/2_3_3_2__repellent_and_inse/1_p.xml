<p>The aphids 
 <italic>Rh. padi</italic> and 
 <italic>S. avenae</italic> are economically important pests on cereals [
 <xref rid="B74-molecules-26-03659" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. These aphids cause mechanical damage to the plants and transmit viruses, and therefore may significantly reduce the yields or compromise the entire crop [
 <xref rid="B75-molecules-26-03659" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. The biological method for pest and disease control in agriculture is an alternative to the widely used conventional chemical production methods. EO are often used as ingredients in biopesticides because they are volatile, and therefore they are good fumigants, evaporate relatively quickly, degrade quickly in soil, and are generally less or non-toxic to animals, humans and the environment [
 <xref rid="B76-molecules-26-03659" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. In this study, the insecticidal activity of EOs obtained from 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic> (M, F) and 
 <italic>J. excelsa</italic> were established by testing the EOs’ efficacy at different concentrations. The tested EOs demonstrated a very good insecticidal effect 24 h after application on the aphids (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03659-t010" ref-type="table">Table 10</xref>). This is due to the fact that EOs most often act as neurotoxins on the insects and they affect their physiological processes [
 <xref rid="B76-molecules-26-03659" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,
 <xref rid="B77-molecules-26-03659" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. The EOs’ efficacy was at 100% on both aphids (
 <italic>S. avenae</italic> and 
 <italic>Rh. padi</italic>). These results are not accidental, because α-рinene, sabinene, limonene and β-myrcene are the main constituents of monoterpenes in 
 <italic>Juniperus</italic> species, and they have been reported to have insecticidal activity [
 <xref rid="B78-molecules-26-03659" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,
 <xref rid="B79-molecules-26-03659" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,
 <xref rid="B80-molecules-26-03659" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Тhe monoterpenes (α-pinene, terpineol, 1,8-cineole, limonene, α-terpinene) and phenyl propanoids (thymol and carvacrol) were found to have a high fumigant activity on 
 <italic>Musca domestica, Tribolium confusum</italic> and 
 <italic>Sitophilus oryzae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B78-molecules-26-03659" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,
 <xref rid="B79-molecules-26-03659" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. These compounds of monoterpenes were also established in the juniper EOs from this study. Therefore, the results suggest that the tested EOs could be utilized at their lowest dose, 1%, to achieve a very good insecticidal effect. The results from this study suggest that the EOs of 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic> (M, F) and 
 <italic>J. excelsa</italic> have the potential to be used in the development of new products for the control of agricultural pests and diseases.
