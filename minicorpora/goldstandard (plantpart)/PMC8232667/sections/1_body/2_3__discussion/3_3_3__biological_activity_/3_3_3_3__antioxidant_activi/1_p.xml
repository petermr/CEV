<p>The genus 
 <italic>Juniperus</italic> comprises around 68 species and 36 different varieties which contain EO, phenols and podophyllotoxin among other non-volatile compounds [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-26-03659" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-26-03659" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The essential oil (EO) of juniper species has wide applications in various products. The antioxidant capacity of 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic> (M, F) and 
 <italic>J. excelsa</italic> EO obtained following the two extraction methods was also evaluated in this study (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03659-t011" ref-type="table">Table 11</xref>). The antioxidant activity of EOs is another biological property of great interest; it depends on a number of factors, such as the composition, distillation timeframe, extraction methods and plant species, among others. The antioxidant capacity of the EOs from other species of junipers (leaves and galbuli) has been previously reported [
 <xref rid="B81-molecules-26-03659" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>,
 <xref rid="B82-molecules-26-03659" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>,
 <xref rid="B83-molecules-26-03659" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,
 <xref rid="B84-molecules-26-03659" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Because the authors used different extraction methods, durations of distillations and calibrations for the comparison of the antioxidant activity, the results may not be appropriate. In this study, the highest antioxidant activity was obtained from 
 <italic>J. excelsa</italic> without galbuli and 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic> F by the Clevenger extraction method for 3 h distillations (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03659-t011" ref-type="table">Table 11</xref>). Previous research reported the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>J. excelsa</italic> galbuli [
 <xref rid="B83-molecules-26-03659" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,
 <xref rid="B85-molecules-26-03659" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] and 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic> galbuli [
 <xref rid="B59-molecules-26-03659" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,
 <xref rid="B83-molecules-26-03659" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]; however, the EO in the latter studies was obtained after 4 h steam distillation, or at specific timeframes during the 4 h hydrodistillation process. Generally, EOs scavenge free radicals and may be included in products for disease protection and health maintenance [
 <xref rid="B86-molecules-26-03659" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]; however, the composition of EOs is very variable. The chemical compositions and related total antioxidant capacities of 
 <italic>J. excelsa</italic> and 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic> depended on many factors, such as the extraction method and the plant part, etc. Therefore, the breeding and selection of two juniper species to develop new varieties for commercial EO production would be an important step to decrease the variablility in natural sources and provide consistency in supply and quality.
