<p>The EO in this study was extracted from 
 <italic>J. excelsa</italic> and 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic> using two extraction methods: hydrodistillation (HD) methods using a Clevenger apparatus (ClevA) and steam distillation in semi-commercial extractor (SCom). The hydrodistillation (HD) method using a ClevA is the standard method for EO extraction from plant material, as described in the British Pharmacopeia [
