<p>It is common knowledge that the composition, biological activity, aroma, color and the production cost of EOs may depend on various factors, including the type of extraction [

While most literature reports found significant differences in the EO composition between the hydro- and steam distillation of various plant species, and between small laboratory glassware apparatus and commercial extractors, the EO composition of 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic> and 
 <italic>J. excelsa</italic> in this study was very similar and not significantly different, refuting part of our working hypothesis related to the anticipated effect of different distillation methods. The concentration of the monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in the EO was also not different between the EO obtained via the two distillation methods. The results support the notion that the extraction of small samples of 
 <italic>J. sabina</italic> and 
 <italic>J. excelsa</italic> via a Clevenger hydrodistillation unit will provide a representative EO content and composition of the respective oils if they are extracted via steam distillation in a commercial facility. Some previous studies reported similar findings for other aromatic plants, such as basil species [
