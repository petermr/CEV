<p>Previous investigations of leaf micromorphology in 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> and 
 <italic>S. subspicata</italic> showed the presence of peltate glandular and variance in the presence of capitate glandular trichomes. The type 1 capitate trichomes (C1) found here were described previously [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-10-00511" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-plants-10-00511" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-plants-10-00511" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Later research also found two more types of capitate trichomes that were not observed in our samples. Capitate trichomes (C1) in the studied samples show different distribution patterns between all three species, suggesting that these trichomes could be an additional taxonomic parameter for separation at the species level. However, a further study involving a greater number of samples from the entire distribution range is necessary. Type 2 capitate trichomes (C2) were previously found in 
 <italic>S. horvatii</italic> [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-10-00511" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] (although in that study trichomes were named digitiform on SEM micrographs) but were not reported earlier for the studied species. C2 trichomes varied mostly in the distribution patterns between all taxa, even including the difference between two populations of the same species from different localities (
 <italic>S. montana</italic>), which could be attributed to the high genetic variability present in this Mediterranean species. The present research showed that there are no differences between the studied 
 <italic>Satureja</italic> species based on the total number of glandular trichomes, but there were significant differences between plant organs based on the number and type of glandular trichomes. This could be explained by different distributions of glandular trichomes that were uneven on plant organs.
