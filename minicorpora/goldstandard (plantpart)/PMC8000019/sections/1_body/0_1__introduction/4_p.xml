<p>The chemical composition of EOs is quite variable, as it is influenced by the drying method [

 <xref rid="B34-plants-10-00511" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and the plant itself due to the different compositions of EO between plant organs [

 <xref rid="B36-plants-10-00511" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These differences are closely related to the organ function, e.g., basil (
 <italic>Ocimumbasilicum</italic>) and lilac sage (
 <italic>Salvia verticillata</italic>) leaf essential oils have insect repellent properties, while flower EOs have pollinator attraction properties [

 <xref rid="B38-plants-10-00511" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Research shows that the highest yield of EO is in a period of flowering [

 <xref rid="B42-plants-10-00511" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], which could be explained by the contribution of essential oils from flowers (calyces and corollas). Moreover, several authors have found a correlation between the number of peltate trichomes and essential oil yield [

 <xref rid="B44-plants-10-00511" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Moreover, peltate and capitate glandular trichomes have a different chemical composition, the peltate oil profile is much more complex, while capitate is simpler [
 <xref rid="B36-plants-10-00511" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Interestingly, the chemical composition of oil in peltate glands varies in quantities of individual components even between other peltate glands on the same organ, e.g., leaf [
