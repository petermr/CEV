<p>The EO profiles of two 
 <italic>Satureja</italic> subspicata subspecies also differed. 
 <italic>S. subspicata</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>liburnica</italic> had EOs strongly dominated by monoterpenes, while EOs of 
 <italic>S. subspicata</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>subspicata</italic> were dominated by sesquiterpenes. The differences between plant parts were also present in these two taxa. In 
 <italic>S. subspicata</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>liburnica</italic> (S1) calyx and corolla, EOs monoterpenes were much more abundant than in leaf EO, while in 
 <italic>S. subspicata</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>subspicata</italic> (S2), the EO of leaves had a higher abundance of oxygenated sesquiterpenes. In both taxa, in all samples, α-pinene was the most abundant compound, however, the second most abundant constituents differed. In subsp. 
 <italic>liburnica</italic>, borneol dominated in leaf and herba EOs, while camphene and camphor were more abundant in flower parts. In subsp. 
 <italic>subspicata</italic>, spathulenol was more abundant in leaf EO, while germacrene D was the second most abundant in flower parts. The herba EO of subsp. 
 <italic>subspicata</italic> was strongly dominated by α-pinene, and the second most abundant compound was germacrene D, though only 6.1%.
