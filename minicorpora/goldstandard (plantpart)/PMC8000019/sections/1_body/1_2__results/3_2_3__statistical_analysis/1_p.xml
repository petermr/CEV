<p>Sixteen components of EO, that were present on average above 0.5%, and did not show a correlation were chosen for multivariate statistical analysis. Even though dominant components and EO profiles differed within the plant between different parts (i.e., leaves, calyces, and corollas), all analyzed taxa separated on the PCA scatter plot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00511-f006">Figure 6</xref>). The first two eigenvectors explained 70.5% of the total variability. Both subspecies of 
 <italic>Satureja subspicata</italic> are separated from 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> and 
 <italic>S. kitaibelii</italic> on the first axis. Two samples of 
 <italic>S. montana</italic>, one continental and one coastal, further separated on both PC axes. 
 <italic>S. kitaibelii</italic> further separated from 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> on the second axis. However, two subspecies of 
 <italic>S. subspicata</italic> also separated on the second axis, though only slightly in comparison to the other samples. This is mainly due to a simpler EO profile, with α-pinene being the dominant compound in both taxa. Four EO components were responsible for the separation of all taxa: α-pinene for the separation of 
 <italic>S. subspicata</italic>, thymol and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene for the separation of 
 <italic>S. montana</italic>, and linalool for the separation of 
 <italic>S. kitaibelii</italic>.
