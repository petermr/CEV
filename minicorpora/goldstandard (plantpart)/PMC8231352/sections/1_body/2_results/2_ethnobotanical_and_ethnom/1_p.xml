<p>The study area is considered one of the Syrian areas rich in medicinal plants. In the east of it there is a desert (badia), which is dominated by desert and thorny plants, and in the west of it, aromatic plants are spread in the mountains near the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea. It is a fact that people in some of these rural areas suffer from poverty, so they depend a lot on folk remedies, and folk healers in these areas provide their expertise at small costs, because the medicinal herbs are cheaper than chemical medicines, and most of the medicinal recipes are available around. However, a large portion of the uses of medicinal plants mentioned in the research are still under study.</p>
