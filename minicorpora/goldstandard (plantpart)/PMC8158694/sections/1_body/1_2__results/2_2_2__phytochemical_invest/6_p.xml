<p>With regards to the young stems, already present in the sampling of 2017, the essential oil composition showed a qualitative overlapping with the 
 <italic>FL</italic>-EO profile, with the dominance of 1,8-cineole (
 <italic>13</italic>) (53.7%), followed by terpinen-4-ol (
 <italic>21</italic>) (7.1%), sabinene (4) (6.7%) and 
 <italic>α</italic>-terpineol (
 <italic>22</italic>) (5.7%). As for 
 <italic>DL</italic>-EO, the high concentration of 1,8-cineole in the young stems was accompanied by a limited concentration of 
 <italic>α</italic>-terpineol; the relative percentages of terpinen-4-ol (
 <italic>21</italic>), 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene (
 <italic>16</italic>) (4.0%), 
 <italic>α</italic>-terpinene (
 <italic>8</italic>) (2.8%), 
 <italic>α</italic>-phellandrene (
 <italic>7</italic>) (2.1%), terpinolene (
 <italic>18</italic>) (0.8%) and 
 <italic>p-</italic>cymene (
 <italic>9</italic>) (1.5%) were instead higher than those in 
 <italic>FL</italic>-80.
