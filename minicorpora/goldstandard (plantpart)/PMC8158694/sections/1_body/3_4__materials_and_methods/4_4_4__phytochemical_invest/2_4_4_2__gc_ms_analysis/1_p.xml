<p>Essential oilswere analyzed by GC-MS using an Agilent 6890 N (Agilent Technologies SpA, Cernusco s/N, Milan, Italy) equipped with a 5973 N mass spectrometer. Separation was achieved on an HP-5 MS capillary column (5% phenylmethylpolysiloxane, 30 m, 0.25 mm i.d., 0.1 μm film thickness; J &amp; W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA) using helium as the carrier gas (1 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>). The temperature of the oven was set to at 60 °C for 5 min, then raised at 4 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> up to 220 °C, finally 11 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> up to 280 °C. The TICs were acquired at 70 eV scanning in the 29–400 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> range. The oil samples were diluted 1:100 in 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, and the volume injected was 2 μL (three replicates). Data were analysed using MSD ChemStation software (Agilent, Version G1701DA D.01.00) and the NIST Mass Spectral Search Program for the NIST/EPA/NIH Mass Spectral Library v. 2.0. The identification of essential oil components was performed by a comparison of retention indices, calculated using a C7–C30 series of 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes (Merck, Milan, Italy) and mass spectra of unknown peaks with those contained in the commercial libraries WILEY275, NIST 17, ADAMS and FFNSC3, as well as those in a homemade library. Percentage values of essential oil components were obtained from the peak areas in the chromatogram without the use of correction factors.
