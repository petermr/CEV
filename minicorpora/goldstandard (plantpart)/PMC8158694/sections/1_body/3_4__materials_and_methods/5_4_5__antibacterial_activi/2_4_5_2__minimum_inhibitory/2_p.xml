<p>Microplates were incubated at 37 °C ± 2 °C for 24 h in a humid chamber. The MIC value was defined as the lowest concentration of essential oilneeded to visibly inhibit bacterial growth [
 <xref rid="B66-plants-10-01008" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) was determined by plating on Tryptone Soy Agar (TSA) from a microplate well corresponding to a MIC value to the higher concentration tested. TSA plates were incubated at 37 °C ± 2 °C for 24 h. MBC value was defined as the lowest concentration of essential oilthat corresponds to the sample in which no bacterial growth was visible. MIC and MBC determinations were performed in triplicate and the results were expressed as mg/mL of EO. Mode of the triplicate was employed for value comparisons.
