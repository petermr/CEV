<p>The characterization of essential oils obtained from diverse plant parts was then performed to evaluate differences among the profiles. The first screening was obtained with essential oil deriving from the complete plant aerial parts, including leaves, young stems and fruits, and showed the predominance of monoterpenes over all the other components. The most abundant compounds were 1,8-cineole (

The preliminary comparison with the literature data showed a moderate quantitative variability of the detected components, as well as a high heterogeneity due to the conservation and distillation procedures applied to the plant material by the various authors. Therefore, we evaluated, in more detail, the essential oil profiles obtained from individual plant parts.
