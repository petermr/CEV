<p>The work of Stubbs et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-10-01008" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], which discuss the comparison between essential oils obtained from entities belonging both to camphor and 1,8-cineole chemotypes, seems to validate this hypothesis, since the data we obtained for the fruit and leaf essential oils are in agreement with those reported in that paper. This work also shows that the oils obtained from the adult parts of the plant (trunk and adult branches) retain the presence of D-camphor, while the young parts seem to have none, suggesting that the absence of this compound in the essential oilswe obtained should be due to the age of plant parts we decided to analyze.
