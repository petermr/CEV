<p>Furthermore, this is the first report on the comparison of leaf essential oilsprofiles obtained following different preservation techniques (fresh, stored at −20 °C, stored at −80 °C, dried), and specifically, no previous work referred to the storage procedure at −80 °C. The obtained essential oilprofiles were compared with each other and with literature data, obtaining a high level of chemical variability; this allowed us to define the optimal conservation technique in relation to the overall yield of essential oil, i.e., storage at −20 °C, and to characterize the common and exclusive compounds. Regarding the desired quality of essential oil, the importance of conservation procedures emerged. In fact, in the case of an essential oil rich in 1,8-cineole it is advantageous to use the drying technique, while in the case of an essential oil rich in α-terpineol, it is preferable to start with fresh plant material subjected to freezing.</p>
