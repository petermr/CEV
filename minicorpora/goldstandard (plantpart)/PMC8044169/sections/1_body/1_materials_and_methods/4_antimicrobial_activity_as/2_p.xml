<p id="Par10">This procedure was performed according to CLSI standards. For this purpose, plates containing Müller Hinton agar and SDA were prepared to culture the bacterial and fungal strains, respectively. The essential oil was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and a concentration of 30 mg/mL was reached. Then 100 µL of bacterial suspensions with a half-McFarland turbidity equivalent in culture medium were cultured in 6 mm well plates and 10 μL (at concentration 30 mg/mL) of essential oil was poured into the wells. The plates were incubated for 48 h and 72 h at 30 °C for fungal strains and for 24 h at 37 °C for bacterial strains. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated for each microorganism by measuring the inhibition diameter with the antibiogram ruler (in millimeters). To evaluate the repeatability of the results, three replicates were performed for each strain. Results were calculated as mean ± SD. Dimethylsulfoxide was used as negative control and gentamicin and rifampin antibiotics or the antifungal nystatin were used for bacteria and fungi respectively, to compare their inhibitory potency with that of essential oil.</p>
