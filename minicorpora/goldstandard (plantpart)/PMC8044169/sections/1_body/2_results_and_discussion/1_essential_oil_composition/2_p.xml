<p id="Par14">Nonterpenoids were those detected in the highest percentage (80.66%) in rose essential oil, while oxygenated sesquiterpenes were not present in it at all. In India, nonterpenoids with the amount of more than 60% and oxygenated sesquiterpenes in amount lower than 0.5% constituted the lowest and highest percentages respectively, of rose essential oils. Verma et al. showed that oil content, type, and oil composition varied among Damascus rose cultivars

 </sup>. Content and composition of essential oil are complex traits that depend on yield components and have been strongly influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Thus, evaluating genotypes from different environments is an important step in Damascus's rosewood breeding programs before selecting the optimum for commercial cultivation. The yields and effects of medicinal plants vary depending on the locations of growth, climatic and ecological conditions, field operations, growth stages, and genetic traits
