<p id="Par35">Light quality can change the composition of essential oils in medicinal plants (Amaki et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2011</xref>). In a study by Batista et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2016</xref>), different qualities of light caused a change in the pattern of essential oil in 
 <italic>Lippia alba</italic>. These researchers showed changes in the number of monoterpenes such as eucalyptol and linalool in two 
 <italic>L. alba</italic> chemotypes under LED and fluorescent lamps. Noguchi and Amaki (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2016</xref>) and Nguyen and Saleh (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2019</xref>) reported an increase in monoterpenes such as alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, limonene and carvone in mint plants under red LED light.
