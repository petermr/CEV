<p id="Par17">Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC–MS) analysis for the essential oil composition was carried out on a Hewlett–Packard 5890 gas chromatograph (Hewlett–Packard, EquipNet, Inc. 50 Hudson Road Canton, MA 02021 USA) coupled to an HP 5970 mass-selective detector (MSD) (Hewlett–Packard, EquipNet, Inc. 50 Hudson Road Canton, MA 02021 USA) using a fused silica ultra-performance cross-linked methyl silicone column (50 mm length, 0.2 mm inner diameter, film thickness 25 µm). Temperature programming was done from 100 to 250 °C at a rate of 4 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup>. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a 1 ml min
 <sup>−1</sup> flow rate. Ionization energy at 70 eV and 250 °C temperature were ordered for the ion source (Li et al.

They were confirmed by a nonpolar HP-5MS column through comparison of their mass spectra against those recorded in the NIST 08, Willey 275.L (ChemStation data system), and those reported in the literature (Davies,
