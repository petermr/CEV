<p>Some species from the genus 
 <italic>Pectis</italic> are commonly known as lemongrasses due to the citric scent of their volatiles, which are similar to

 <xref rid="B2-molecules-26-03666" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In fact, a literature review showed that, due to this unique phytochemical profile, 
 <italic>Pectis</italic> spp. has been used as substitutes to replace the true 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> lemongrass. The wide range of ethnopharmacological applications of the tea and infusion preparations include the treatment of colds, grippes and fever, anxiety, hypertension, stomach disorders and hypotension and use as a calmative [

However, despite this, the essential oils (EOs) obtained from the species of this genus show a high amount of monoterpenes that may be mostly represented by citral; in some cases, high amounts of other monoterpenes, such as Î±-pinene and limonene, may be observed, impairing the scent [
