<p>One might expect that the bioactive properties of citral (e.g., anti-inflammatory action) [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-26-03666" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] would be of interest for their uses in several novel industrial products. However, the EOs have intrinsic characteristics that impair the fulfillment of their full industrial potential, such as hydrophobicity, volatility and chemically instability. Thus, one of the main technological challenges is to maintain the original desirable characteristics in EO-based systems.
