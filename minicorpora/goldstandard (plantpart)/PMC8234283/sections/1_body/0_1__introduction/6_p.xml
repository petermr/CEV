<p>In the context of low-energy methods, if the nano-emulsifier is a surfactant it can trigger some changes that may sub-divide this main group according to the involved phenomena. If there is no change in the spontaneous curvature of the surfactant (or if no surfactant is used) and the nano-emulsification occurs due to a rapid diffusion of hydrophilic molecules to the external phase, the process is called spontaneous nano-emulsification. However, if there is a change in the spontaneous curvature of the surfactant during the generation of the nano-emulsions, phase inversion temperature (PIT) or phase inversion composition (PIC) methods can be used [

The latter are of great interest for EOs and, by using specific blends of hydrophilicâ€“lipophilic biodegradable surfactants, it is possible to achieve stable and promising EO-based oil in water nano-emulsions. As part of our ongoing studies with these natural volatile oils, we have obtained optimal nano-emulsions with EOs from different species using ecofriendly, low-energy methods with a view to their further practical applications [
