<p>Nanodelivery systems can successfully overcome this issue and are a promising approach to maintain and also improve the quality, safety and functionality of EO-based products [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-26-03666" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], allowing the obtainment of high-value nanophytopharmaceuticals directly linked to industrial crops, such as those rich in EOs. In this context, special attention should be given to oil in water nano-emulsion, since it can disperse the EOs as fine nanodroplets in aqueous media. Two main approaches have been used in the generation of nano-emulsions: high-energy and low-energy methods. The first group makes use of highly disruptive forces generated by specific devices. These devices include ultrasound generators. Double nano-emulsions containing glycyrrhizic acid, a sesquiterpene saponin, were obtained with this technique using skim milk as the external phase of this W/O/W colloid [

However, the high-energy methods elevate the costs of the process for industrial applications, since the high-scale equipment is more expensive compared to conventional method and, furthermore, most of the energy used in the nano-emulsification is lost in the process. The second group makes use of the chemical energy of the system to generate the nanodroplets and, if well designed, these nano-emulsions can also be scalable [
