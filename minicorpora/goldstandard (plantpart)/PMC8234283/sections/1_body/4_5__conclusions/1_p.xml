<p>Low logP values and relatively high water solubility highlight the peculiarity of citral and may trigger the destabilization of nano-emulsions rich in the essential oil that is abundant in these terpenes. Therefore, we described a facile, non-heating, low-energy method for a lemongrass that can be used as a prototype for further industrial applications of high-citral-based nano-emulsions, especially for incorporation of this bioactive mixture of monoterpenes in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals or for citral-rich essential oils in phytocosmetics and phytotherapics.</p>
