 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03666-f001">Figure 1</xref> shows the chromatographic profile of the EO extracted with the 
 <italic>P. elongata</italic>-based nano-emulsions immediately after the process of its preparation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03666-f001">Figure 1</xref>B–D). All replicates were similar to the EO (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03666-f001">Figure 1</xref>A), indicating that the nano-emulsification did not affect the overall phytochemical profile of the EO. The CRNE was 1.22 ± 0.03 and corresponded to 94.56% of the CROE, which also indicated that the ratio between the geranial and neral compounds, the two main monoterpenes of the EO, was not altered after the nano-emulsification.
