 <xref rid="molecules-26-03666-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows the size, PdI and zeta potential values of the nano-emulsion prepared with the EO from 
 <italic>P. elongata</italic>. During the first 14 days of storage (up to day 14), no major alterations in the size diameter were observed. Then, a slight tendency for droplet growth was observed up to 30 days of storage (DG
 <sub>14,30</sub> = 13.88%). Despite the droplets increasing growth up to 90 days of storage (DG
 <sub>30,60</sub> = 26.82%, DG
 <sub>60,90</sub> = 18.52%), the PdI presented an overall decreasing tendency and stabilized between 30 and 90 days of storage after reaching a minimum (&lt;0.1). Low values (in module) of the zeta potential were observed, probably due to the low polarizability of the EO components and utilization of non-ionic surfactants. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03666-f002">Figure 2</xref> shows the droplet size distribution graphs, in term of intensity, of the nano-emulsions. It is possible to see the narrowing of the curves as a function of the time of storage. This behavior was more evident in the period between 60 and 90 days of storage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03666-f002">Figure 2</xref>B), as observed by the displacement of the curves to slightly higher diameter sizes. It is interesting to note that citral (geranial and neral) showed a low logP (&lt;4.3) value (3.17) and high water solubility (84.71 mg/L), as observed using the Chemspider Platform. These properties can been used to explain the behavior of EO-based nano-emulsions.
