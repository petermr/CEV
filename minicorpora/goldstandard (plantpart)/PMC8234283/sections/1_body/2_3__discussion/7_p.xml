<p>Citral-based nano-emulsions, prepared with 1% terpene and polysorbate 80, were generated by ultrasound and analyzed at days 0 and 60. The droplet sizes were respectively 34 nm and 324 nm, while the PdIs were 0.294 and 0.1. The macroscopic analysis of these nano-emulsions showed that, from day 0 to day 15 (25 Â°C), they presented a clear and stable appearance, before starting to flocculate and presenting a milky appearance after 30 of storage [
