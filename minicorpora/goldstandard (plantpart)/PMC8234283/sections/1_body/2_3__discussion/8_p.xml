<p>Arnon-Rips and co-workers [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-03666" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] developed a coarse emulsion through magnetic stirring using citral (5%) and sunflower oil (1:1), polysorbate 80 and double-distilled water. A nano-emulsion was obtained by submitting this coarse emulsion to ultra-sonication, the initial droplet size and PdI of the coarse emulsion being reduced from 4 µm and 0.948 to 400–500 nm and 0.375, respectively, after the nanosizing. Concerning the stability, the coarse emulsion showed phase separation after 1 h at room temperature, while the nano-emulsion maintained stability for weeks.
