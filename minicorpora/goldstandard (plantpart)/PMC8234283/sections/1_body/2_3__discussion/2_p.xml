<p>Low-energy methods claim to make use of the chemical energy of a system to generate the fine droplets instead of using high disruptive forces as in the case of high-energy methods [

Despite the fact that some nano-emulsions were successfully generated with a low-energy method involving a heating step—which one would expect to be in accordance with changes in the spontaneous curvature of the non-ionic surfactant associated with the phase inversion temperature method [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-03666" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]—we decided that this approach should be avoided, due to the intrinsically volatile nature of the EO compounds, and replaced by methods that work in accordance with phase inversion composition concepts [

 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-03666" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, to the best of our knowledge, most of the studies in the literature do not investigate whether the low-energy non-heating method properly maintains the profile of the EO after the process of nano-emulsification (generation of the nanodroplets).
