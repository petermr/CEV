While the droplet size at HLB = 9 was 126 nm, it practically increased twofold at HLB = 6. One would expect that EOs would have components that are “more hydrophilic” than the fatty acids in conventional oils constituted by non-secondary metabolites (e.g., olive oil). Therefore, it is common to see EO-based nano-emulsions even when developed with pure hydrophilic non-ionic surfactants, such as polysorbate 20 or polysorbate 80. Despite the finding that compositional ripening may trigger stabilization [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-03666" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], it is well-established that addition of a lipophilic co-surfactant contributes to stabilization of nano-droplets, especially if a chemically similar pair of surfactants is used. Inthis context, the use of a pair of non-ionic surfactants in the present study proved to be a valuable strategy to obtain fine droplets of citral-rich
