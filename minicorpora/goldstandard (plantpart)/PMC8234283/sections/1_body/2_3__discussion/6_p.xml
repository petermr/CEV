By studying the nano-emulsification of lemon oil, they observed that compounds with low water solubility, which can be also understood as high logP (&gt;4.3), were stabilizing the system through a “Compositional ripening effect”. Therefore, considering the high citral content of this EO, further investigations should be performed to better elucidate the absence of multiple droplet populations, as well to complete the quantification of citral during storage and take into account droplet maintenance over a longer period with a wide range of non-ionic surfactant pairs. However, for the aims of the present study, it was sufficient to observe that it was possible to successfully generate fine nanodroplets that reached equilibria during the storage period analyzed, narrowing the curve of size distribution and avoiding phase separation.
