<p>Despite this, one would expect that the absence of any heating step would lead to a relatively constant ratio among EO phytochemicals.Some points can thereforebe considered. It is well-known that diffusion of EO components triggers series of phenomena that can induce an antagonistic mechanism of destabilization (Ostwald ripening) of the opposed force stabilization (compositional ripening), both being responsible for further differences in the distribution of the phytochemicals between the internal/external phases [

If we hypothesize that this behavior happens concomitantly to the generation of the nanodroplets during the titration process of nano-emulsification, and considering that whenEO compounds are located at the external aqueous phase they are more susceptible to volatilization, it can be expected to facilitate a loss.
