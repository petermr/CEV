<p>In fact, even some of the components that may be used in nano-emulsions generate exotermic reactions (e.g., dimethylsulfoxide/water) [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-03666" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and even in the absence of an intended heating step (e.g.,the PIT method) some alteration of the ratios between EO phytochemicals might occur if evaporation of the more volatile ones happens after some external phase heating. In the cases of mixtures prepared with some alcohols and n-alkanes prepared with edible vegetable oil, enthalpies of mixing have beencalculated to be, respectively, strongly and slighly endothermic [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-03666" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, to the best of our knowledge, mixtures of endogenous constituents of EOs (terpenes), or EOs/co-surfactant(s)/non-ionic surfactant(s)/water, of interest inthe use of colloids due to the notable impairments for industry resulting from low-energy methods, have not been extensively investigated. Therefore, we believe that, despite non-heating methods beingcapable of maintaining the fingerprint of an EO, it is important to evaluate the EOâ€™sprofile after the preparation of the nano-emulsion as well as the ratio of the chemical markers, especially in the case of remarkable compounds, such as lemongrasses that contain high citral content.
