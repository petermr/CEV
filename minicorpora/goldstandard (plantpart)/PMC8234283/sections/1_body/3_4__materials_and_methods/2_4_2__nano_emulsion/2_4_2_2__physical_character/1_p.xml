<p>The droplet size distribution of the nano-emulsions was performed using dynamic light scattering analysis on a Malvern ZetasizerNanoZS (Malvern, UK) [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-03666" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-26-03666" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] with the following specifications: laser source: 10 mW, λ 632.8 nm; scattering angle for size measurements: 173°. The results were given as the cumulant (z-average) size and the polydispersity index (PdI) for the size distribution of the droplets was expressed as the mean ± SD values. The zeta potential was also measured on the same equipment and expressed as mV values.
