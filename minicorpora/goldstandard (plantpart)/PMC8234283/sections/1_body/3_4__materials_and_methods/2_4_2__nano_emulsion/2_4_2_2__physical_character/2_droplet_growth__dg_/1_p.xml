<p>The behavior of the nano-emulsions was evaluated in term of the droplet growth (expressed as the percentage of the droplet size increase) [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-03666" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] within a period of storage and was calculated as follows:
 <disp-formula>DG = [(Sizet2 − Sizet1)/Sizet1] × 100,

 </disp-formula> where Sizet1 is the average size in the lower limit and Sizet2 is the average size in the upper limit of the t1 → t2 range of the DG calculation.
