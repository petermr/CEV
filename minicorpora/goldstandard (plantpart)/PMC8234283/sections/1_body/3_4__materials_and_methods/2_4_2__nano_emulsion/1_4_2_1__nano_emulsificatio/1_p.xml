<p>The nano-emulsions were prepared with a low-energy, non-heating method and were composed of 5% (

Prior to the obtainment of the OP, its components were pooled together and vigorously mixed in a vortex stirrer. The surfactant-to-oil ratio (SOR) was 1, therefore indicating that the amount of the blend of non-ionic surfactants was the same as forthe EO used in the OP. The amounts of polysorbate 80 and sorbitan trioleate were calculated in order to achieve a blend with a hydrophilicâ€“lipophilic balance (HLB) value of 13. Then, deionized water was added dropwise under vortex stirring and the bluish reflection associated with the Tyndall effect was considered indicative of the generation of nano-emulsion. The nano-emulsification was undertaken in triplicate.
