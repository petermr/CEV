<p>The citral ratio (CR) was calculated in order to verify whether the nano-emulsification affected the ratio between the geranial and neral immediately after the process of its preparation. It was expressed as a function of the percentages of geranial/neral in the nano-emulsions, as follows:
 <disp-formula>CR = %geranial/%neral</disp-formula>
 <disp-formula>%geranial= (Ageranial × 100)/Atotal</disp-formula>
 <disp-formula>%neral = (Aneral × 100)/Atotal</disp-formula> where Ageranial is the area of geranial obtained by peak normalization, Aneral is the area of neral obtained by peak normalization and Atotal is the sum of Ageranial and Aneral.
