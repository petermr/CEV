<p>In order to evaluate whether the nano-emulsification affected the overall phytochemical profile of the EO in the nano-emulsion immediately after the process of its preparation, the nano-emulsion was subjected to gas chromatography analysis. It was partitioned with hexane (1:3, 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) and the mixture was vigorously mixed and left to equilibrate for 30 min. This procedure was repeated 10 times. The organic layer was collected for injection with a GCMS-QP2010 Ultra chromatograph (Shimadzu Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) under the same experimental conditions described for the characterization of the EO.
