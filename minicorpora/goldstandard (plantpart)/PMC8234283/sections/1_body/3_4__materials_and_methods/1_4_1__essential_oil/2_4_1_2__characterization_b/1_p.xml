<p>The EO was directly solubilized in hexane. An Rxi-5ms (5% diphenydilmethylpolysiloxane) fused silica capillary column (Restek Corporation, Bellefonte, PA, United States); 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 µm phase thickness) was used. The experimental conditions were as follows: injection mode was split (split ratio = 1:20); the injector temperature was 250 °C; the carrier gas was helium (99.995%); the flow rate was 1.0 mL/min; the oven temperature (column temperature) was 60–240 °C at 3 °C/min, ending with an isothermal at this final temperature for 10 min; the electron ionization mode was set at 70 eV; the ion source temperature was 200 °C; and the interface temperature was 250 °C. The mass spectra were recorded with an automatic scan of 0.3 s and mass fragments at a mass range of 35–400

The relative percentage of the compounds was obtained with a normalization method using a GC 2010 Ultra System (Shimadzu Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) gas chromatograph coupled to a flame ionization detector. The experimental conditions were the same as previously described except the carrier gas, which here was nitrogen.
