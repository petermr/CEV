 <caption>
  <p>Droplet size distribution graphs of the Pectis elongata-based nano-emulsion. Superimposed graphs show measurements after (
   <bold>A</bold>) 0–30 days of storage, (
   <bold>B</bold>) 60–90 days of storage and (
   <bold>C</bold>) 0–90 days of storage. Colors representing size distribution curves of three independent batches of the prepared nano-emulsions. Measurements were performed in triplicate.
