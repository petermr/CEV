<p>Seven essential oils were used for seed treatments, initially at the three concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/mL essential oils, using the standard blotter assay. The results show that these essential oils significantly reduced the incidence of infected seeds relative to the negative controls (

 <italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic> and 
 <italic>Lavandula dentata</italic> essential oils at 0.5 mg/mL and 1 mg/mL were highly effective against incidence of infected seeds (ranged from 77.0â€“88.5%), compared to the similar levels achieved by the fungicide treatment (96.5%). Moreover, the incidence of infected seeds was significantly reduced by treatments at 1 mg/mL with 
 <italic>Lavandula hybrida</italic>, 
 <italic>Melaleuca alternifolia</italic>, 
 <italic>Laurus nobilis</italic>, and the two 
 <italic>Origanum majorana</italic> (#1 and #2) essential oils, by 66.5%, 59.8%, 65.5%, 54.1%, and 73.5%, respectively. Furthermore, the effects on the incidence of seed infections of these seven essential oils at 0.5 mg/mL and 1 mg/mL were not significantly different across the essential oils (
