<p>Seed treatments with 0.5 mg/mL 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> essential oil significantly increased the seedling emergence (

 <italic>C. citratus</italic> essential oil showed 30% emergence, while the control treatment (0.1% Tween 20) and the fungicides treatment showed 20% and 10% emergence, respectively. In particular, these data demonstrated that the seeds treated with the fungicides took longer to emerge (
