<p>The effects of the treatments with the seven essential oils at 0.5 mg/mL on seed germination and radicle length are also shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02354-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. No significant differences in germination rates were seen between the control seeds and the seeds treated with the different essential oils. On the other hand, the germination of the seeds treated with the fungicide combination (25 g/L difenoconazole and 25 g/L fludioxonil) was significantly reduced, by 11.5%, compared to the control. Moreover, for the radicle length, these data showed that the 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> and 
 <italic>O. majorana #1</italic> essential oils did not have any significant effects compared with the control. However, the radicle lengths of the seeds treated with the 
 <italic>L. dentata</italic>, 
 <italic>L. hybrida</italic>, 
 <italic>M. alternifolia</italic>, 
 <italic>L. nobilis</italic>, and 
 <italic>O. majorana #2</italic> essential oils were significantly decreased by 28.2%, 23.4%, 34.5%, 25.8%, and 27.8%, respectively. On the contrary, compared to the control, the radicle length of the seeds treated with the fungicides was significantly increased, by 24.4%.
