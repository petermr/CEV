<p>From the initial data in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02354-f001">Figure 1</xref> and considering the rates of the individual fungal infections of the seeds from the blotter assays in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02354-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, it can be seen that the treatments with the essential oils did protect against the potential for seedborne infections compared with the controls. As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02354-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, in the control, seeds the pathogen 
 <italic>S. cucurbitacearum</italic> was frequently revealed to be carried by the seeds in the blotter assay (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02354-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, 16.1%); this incidence rate was significantly reduced for this fungus for all of the seed treatments with the essential oils (overall mean incidence, 4.4%; overall inhibition, ~73%). In addition, the most effective of the essential oils were 
 <italic>O. majorana #2</italic> and 
 <italic>M. alternifolia</italic>, which significantly reduced seed infections by 
 <italic>S. cucurbitacearum</italic> by 84.5% and 75.8%, respectively. These effects were also not significantly different compared to the seed treatment with the fungicides (98.8%). For the seeds that carried 
 <italic>A. alternata</italic>, there were significant reductions for the seed treatments by the seven essential oils that ranged from 71.0% (
 <italic>O. majorana #1</italic>) to 89.3% (
 <italic>L. dentata</italic> and 
 <italic>L. nobilis</italic>), again with no significant differences between the seeds treated with the essential oils and the fungicides. 
 <italic>Fusarium fujikuroi</italic> was the most frequent fungus on the control seeds (incidence 22.6%) and considerably significantly reduced by the essential oils, in particular with the 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> and 
 <italic>L. dentata</italic> essential oil treatments, by 76.6% and 89.4%, respectively, with these treatments also showing no significant differences compared to the seeds treated with the fungicides. All of the essential oils were also significantly effective against 
 <italic>F. solani</italic> (except 
 <italic>L. hybrida</italic>, at a non-significant 34.8% inhibition), with reductions of seed infections from 89.1â€“100%. The incidence of 
 <italic>Paramyrothecium roridum</italic> was also significantly reduced for all of the seeds treated with the essential oils. Again, these effects were not significantly different between the essential oils, where the most effective inhibition appeared to be with 
 <italic>M. alternifolia</italic> (87.9%), 
 <italic>L. dentata</italic> (82.8%), and 
 <italic>O. majorana #1</italic> (82.8%), with this fungus completely removed by the fungicides. The incidence of 
 <italic>Albifimbria verrucaria</italic> on the seeds was significantly reduced by the 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic>, 
 <italic>L. hybrida</italic>, 
 <italic>L. nobilis</italic>, and 
 <italic>O. majorana #2</italic> essential oils, by 84.9%, 93.9%, 69.7%, and 69.7%, respectively. Instead, the inhibition by the remaining essential oils did not reach significance over the control (
 <italic>L. dentata</italic>, 
 <italic>M. alternifolia</italic>, and 
 <italic>O. majorana #1</italic>, all at 48.5%). For the seeds infected by 
 <italic>Curvularia spicifera</italic>, there were reductions across these seven essential oils from 63.6% (
 <italic>O. majorana #1</italic>) to 100% (
 <italic>L. dentata</italic>), with relatively low, but not significantly different, inhibition seen for the fungicides (69.7%). 
 <italic>Rhizopus stolonifer</italic> was significantly reduced by similar amounts in all of the seeds treated with the essential oils. The most effective here appeared to be 
 <italic>L. dentata</italic> (77.4%) and 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> (74.4%), and the least effective were the two 
 <italic>O. majorana</italic> essential oils (
 <italic>#1</italic> and 
 <italic>#2</italic>: 50.6%, 49.4%, respectively); the fungicides showed 93.9% inhibition here.
