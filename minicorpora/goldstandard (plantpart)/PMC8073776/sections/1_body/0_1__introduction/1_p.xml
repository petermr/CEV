<p>Disease management is one of the biggest challenges for quantity and quality of crop production. As pathogen infections can be difficult to control, early treatments with antimicrobial compounds are often used to provide disease prevention. 
 <italic>Cucurbita</italic> spp. can be affected by many fungal diseases, such as gummy stem blight (caused by 
 <italic>Stagonosporopsis cucurbitacearum</italic>), 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> fruit rot (caused by 
 <italic>Fusarium solani</italic> f. sp. 
 <italic>cucurbitae</italic>), 
 <italic>Alternaria</italic> leaf spot (caused by 
 <italic>Alternaria alternata</italic>,

 <xref rid="B6-molecules-26-02354" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. All of these pathogens that are responsible for the main diseases on cucurbits can be carried on seeds. This association between seeds and pathogens is an important means for the pathogens to spread on a large scale and a way to guarantee their survival in nature [
