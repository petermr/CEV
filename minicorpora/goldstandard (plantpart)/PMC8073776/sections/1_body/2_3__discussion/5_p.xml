<p>A normal germination rate of &gt;85% was seen here for all of the treated seeds, except with the fungicides. This confirms that these seven essential oils at concentration of 0.5 mg/mL are not phytotoxic to squash seed germination. Orzali et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-26-02354" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] showed also that an 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> essential oil did not affect germination rates of tomato seeds. However, the concentration of essential oil and the immersion time of the seeds in the treatments are very important factors for phytotoxicity, as they can affect seed vitality [

 <xref rid="B53-molecules-26-02354" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In addition, here the 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> essential oil showed no significant inhibition of germination while it significantly inhibited the seed contamination, and unlike other essential oils here, 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> did not show significant shortening of the radicle length compared to the control following seed germination. For these reasons, this essential oil was selected in the final stages of this study, to be tested on the emergence and growth of the squash plantlets, and the disease incidence of 
 <italic>S. cucurbitacearum</italic> for these plantlets.
