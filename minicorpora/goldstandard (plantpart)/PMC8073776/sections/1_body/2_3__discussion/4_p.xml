<p>The 
 <italic>L. hybrida</italic> essential oil used in the present study was characterized previously to have relatively high content of linalool, followed by linalyl acetate and camphor [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-02354" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Here, the 
 <italic>L. hybrida</italic> essential oil showed moderate activity against seed infections. There were significant reductions in the 
 <italic>A. verrucaria</italic> and 
 <italic>A. alternata</italic> seed infections, although no significant reduction for 
 <italic>F. solani</italic> compared to control. Daferera et al. [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-26-02354" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] reported that the main compounds in their 
 <italic>L. hybrida</italic> essential oil were linalyl acetate and linalool, and this essential oil showed less inhibitory activity against 
 <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> and 
 <italic>F. solani</italic> compared to oregano and thyme essential oils. The main compounds of a 
 <italic>Salvia sclarea</italic> essential oil were also reported as linalyl acetate and linalool, and this essential oil showed good inhibitory activity against 
 <italic>A. alternata</italic> [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-26-02354" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Indeed, Kishore et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-26-02354" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] showed that linalool had the lowest inhibitory activity against 
 <italic>A. alternata</italic>, 
 <italic>C. lunata, Fusarium moniliforme</italic>, 
 <italic>Fusarium pallidoroseum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Fusarium udum</italic>. The same essential oil of 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> was shown to have the greatest inhibition of the growth of 
 <italic>S. cucurbitacearum</italic> and 
 <italic>A. alternata</italic> [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-02354" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This activity has been confirmed in vivo in the present study, with reduction of the incidence of infection by the seedborne fungi for the plantlets following treatment of the seeds with the 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> essential oil. Chen et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-26-02354" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], demonstrated the effectiveness of a 
 <italic>Cymbopogon nardus</italic> (citronella) essential oil on 
 <italic>A. alternata</italic> in in vitro and in vivo assays. Eke et al. [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-26-02354" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] reported that a 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> essential oil protected common bean plantlets from infection by 
 <italic>F. solani</italic>, both in the laboratory and a greenhouse.
