<p>The present study was performed in a controlled environment where seven essential oils were shown to be effective against the main seedborne fungi when applied to squash seeds that were naturally infected. The seed treatments with the 
 <italic>M. alternifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>O. majorana #2</italic> essential oils showed excellent activities against the 
 <italic>S. cucurbitacearum</italic> and 
 <italic>F. solani</italic> pathogens, with 
 <italic>F. solani</italic> completely inhibited. These high antifungal activities of these two essential oils in particular appear to be the result of the high content of the monoterpene alcohol terpinen-4-ol, which in previous studies has shown good antifungal activity against 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> spp. [
