<p>Antifungal properties of essential oils towards 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> spp. have been reported in a number of previous studies, for different laboratory media and plant materials [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-02354" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-02354" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-26-02354" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Perczak et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-26-02354" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] reported that essential oils have great potential for inhibition of growth of 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> fungi on maize seeds. An 
 <italic>O. majorana</italic> essential oil was shown to have antifungal activities against four seedborne fungi in rice: 
 <italic>Fusarium verticilliodies</italic>, 
 <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic>, 
 <italic>Bipolaris oryzae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Curvularia lunata</italic> [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-26-02354" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Van der Wolf et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-26-02354" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] showed that thyme, oregano, cinnamon, and clove essential oils can reduce fungi on cabbage seeds, using the blotter method. Riccioni et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-02354" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] reported the efficacy of a tea tree essential oil to reduce Ascochyta blight in pea seeds. Their seed treatments with 
 <italic>L. nobilis</italic> and 
 <italic>L. dentata</italic> essential oils showed significant reductions of 
 <italic>A. alternata</italic>. These two essential oils were characterized by high eucalyptol as their main volatile component. Xu et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-26-02354" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] showed excellent antifungal activity of a 
 <italic>L. nobilis</italic> essential oil when tested against 
 <italic>A. alternata</italic>. In addition, Xu et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-26-02354" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] demonstrated that 0.5 mg/mL of their 
 <italic>L. nobilis</italic> essential oil protected cherry tomatoes from infection with 
 <italic>A. alternata</italic>.
