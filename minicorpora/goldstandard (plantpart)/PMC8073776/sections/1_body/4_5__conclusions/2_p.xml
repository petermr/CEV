<p>Seed treatments with essential oils can contribute to effective management of seedborne fungi on cucurbits under integrated and organic agriculture. These strategies are needed to minimize the inoculum of potential pathogens on seeds, and can be available in the future. The success of the application of such nonchemical alternatives requires an integrated approach that involves the combination of multiple control strategies according to the localization of the pathogen on the seeds. These methods of alternative strategies now need to be further developed as relevant pest management tools for sustainable agricultural production.</p>
