<p>Analysis of variance was calculated using SPSS (version 20; IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). The data for incidence of infected seeds, germination rates, radicle lengths, plantlet infection, and plantlet lengths underwent analysis of variance (ANOVA). Means were compared using Fisher’s tests for protected least significant difference (LSD) at 
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05. All of the trials were repeated at least twice, and the data are given as means ±standard error (SE). The following sample sets were used: 10 replicates of 10 seeds for the effects of the essential oils on disease incidence at three concentrations; 20 replicates of 10 seeds from each treatment to determine the effect of treatments on infected seeds at 0.5 mg/mL; and 5 replicates of 10 seeds from each treatment to determine the effect of 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> on emergence of seedling and disease incidence on the plantlets.
