<p>The naturally contaminated seeds were treated separately with the 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> essential oil at 0.5 mg/mL and with the fungicides (25 g/L difenoconazole + 25 g/L fludioxonil). Tween 20 (0.1%) was used as the control. For each treatment, 50 seeds were used, according to the method described above, and the experimental trials were repeated twice. The treated seeds were sown on pasteurized soil in disinfected seedling trays. The seeds in the trays were incubated at room temperature (22 ± 2 °C). Seedling emergence was recorded based on the number of emerged seedlings every 2 days, up to 14 days after sowing. At 14 days after sowing, the dead and germinated seedlings were recorded. Then 40 days after sowing, the lengths of the plantlets were measured and recorded. At the same time, 30 symptomatic and asymptomatic plantlets from each treatment were collected randomly and sliced into their three major parts—the leaves, stems, and roots—using a flame-sterilized scalpel, to determine the incidence of 
 <italic>S. cucurbitacearum</italic> infection for each part. Each vegetative section was surface-disinfected in 1% sodium hypochlorite for 2 min, rinsed three times in sterile distilled water, and dried on sterile blotter paper. Each part was cut into pieces of about 2 mm, plated on potto dextrose agar, and assessed for fungal colony development after 7 days of incubation at 22 ± 2 °C. Morphological identification of the colonies was carried out to determine 
 <italic>S. cucurbitacearum</italic> growth. The proportions of 
 <italic>S. cucurbitacearum</italic> transmission (
 <italic>Sc t</italic>) we calculated based on Equation (1): 
 <disp-formula>
  <italic>Sc t</italic> (%) = [Number of infected sections of plantlet/Total section of plantlet] × 100
  <label>(1)</label>
