<p>To compare the efficacies of the different essential oils on the fungi of these naturally infecting seeds, the intermediary 0.5 mg/mL concentration was chosen. Here, 200 seeds were treated separately with each of the seven essential oils at 0.5 mg/mL, as described above. Seeds immersed in 0.1% Tween 20 were used as the control. After 14 days of incubation, fungi identification was carried out first by examination of the fungal fruiting bodies and the congregated mycelia and spores on the seeds under a stereomicroscope (M125; Leica Microsystems CMS, Wetzlar, Germany). Then, the individual spores, conidiophores, and pycnidia were examined under a microscope (DM 2500; Leica). The fungal species identification was based on the keys of Mathur and Kongsdal [

 <xref rid="B4-molecules-26-02354" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Assessments were based on relative frequencies of seedborne fungi, the germination rates of the seeds and the length of the growing radicle.
