<p>Before the treatments, naturally contaminated seeds were surface sterilized in 1% sodium hypochlorite solution for 5 min, rinsed three times with sterilized distilled water, and air dried for 2 h on sterile paper towel in a laminar flow hood. For the seed treatments, the seven essential oils were dissolved in sterilized distilled water with 0.1% (

 <italic>v</italic>) Tween 20 (Sigma Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany), to obtain homogeneous emulsions. Three final concentrations for each essential oil were initially used to determine the most effective concentration: 0.25 mg/mL, 0.5 mg/mL, and 1 mg/mL essential oils. The naturally infected seeds were immersed in 40 mL of each concentration of the essential oils, and in the fungicides (Celest Extra 17%: 25 g/L difenoconazole + 25 g/L fludioxonil). In parallel, two negative controls were prepared of the seeds in sterile distilled water and in 0.1% Tween 20. These seed treatments were carried out for 6 h, with mixing every 30 min. Then, the seeds were dried on sterile blotter sheets overnight (12 h) at room temperature (25–28 °C). The treated seeds were placed in glass Petri dishes that each contained eight pieces of sterile blotter paper (diameter, 110 mm; Whatman no. 4 filter papers) that were moistened with 5 mL sterile distilled water. These were incubated for 14 days at 22 ± 2 °C with a 12/12 h dark/ultraviolet light photoperiod (TL-D 36W BLB 1SL, Philips, Dublin, Ireland). To determine number of infected seeds, all Petri dishes were examined under a stereomicroscope (M125; Leica Microsystems CMS, Wetzlar, Germany). For each concentration of the different essential oils, 100 seeds were treated and the experimental trial was repeated twice.
