 <p>In this study, microcapsules were prepared by solvent evaporation technique using ethyl cellulose component as wall and essential oil as core material. The synthesis of microcapsules was carried out using different oil masses. The analysis of the microcapsules was carried out using field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and UV spectrophotometric analysis using absorption spectrophotometer. The obtained results confirm the regular spherical shape and size of the synthesized microcapsules. The qualitative and quantitative spectrophotometric analysis of the microencapsulated immortelle oil was measured at the wavelength of 265 nm. The calibration diagram was used to calculate the unknown concentrations of the microencapsulated oil. The obtained results confirm the application of the presented method as relevant for the possible determination of microencapsulated oil on textile materials.</p>
