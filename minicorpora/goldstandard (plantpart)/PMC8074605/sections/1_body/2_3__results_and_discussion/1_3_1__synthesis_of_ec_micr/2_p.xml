<p>It is obvious that some of the microcapsules are lost in the final step of synthesis. The greatest loss of microcapsules (17.5%) occurs during synthesis C, which is due to the highest mass of oil. An increase in the residual mass of microcapsules is observed with an increase in the initial mass of immortelle EO. This observation is consistent with the observed consistency of the mixture, in which more immortelle EO is present.</p>
