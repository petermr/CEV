 <xref rid="molecules-26-02390-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> shows the amount of utilization of immortelle EO in the synthesis of microcapsules (B-2). The absorbance at a wavelength of 265 nm was measured on an absorption spectrophotometer, and the unknown concentration of immortelle EO, which was not fully synthesized into a microcapsule, was taken after centrifuge and calculated using a calibration diagram.
