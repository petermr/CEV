<p>The UV spectrophotometer Cary 50 Solascreen was used to measure the absorbance of various concentrations of immortelle EO at different wavelengths (200–400 nm). 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02390-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows the absorbance values and concentrations of the oil for the calibration diagram. Using the concentrations and measured absorbance of 5 different solutions of immortelle EO, a calibration diagram was constructed in
