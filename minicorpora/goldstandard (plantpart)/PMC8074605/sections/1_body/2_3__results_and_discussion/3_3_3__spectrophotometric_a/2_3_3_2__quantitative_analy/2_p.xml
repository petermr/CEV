<p>Then, 1 mg of the synthesized microcapsules, different amounts of immortelle EO (0 = 0.0 g, A = 0.15 g, B = 0.20 g, C = 0.30 g) were dissolved in 10 mL of hexane (stirring for 5 min) and the absorbances were measured by spectrophotometer. From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02390-f004">Figure 4</xref> it can be seen that all three microcapsules (A, B, and C) have maximum absorbance at 265 nm. Microcapsules without oil (0) have no absorption maximum. This means that the presence of oil can be detected in the previous solutions of the microcapsules.
