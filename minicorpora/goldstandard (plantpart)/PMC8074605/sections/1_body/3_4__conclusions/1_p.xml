<p>The results obtained in this research confirmed influence of immortelle EO mass on EC microcapsules properties. EC microcapsules with immortelle EO with four different mass of oil were synthetized. Microcapsules synthesized with 0.20 g of immortelle EO represent the best choice because they have less losses in synthesis, the amount of synthetized microcapsules are acceptable and subjectively they have expected intense smell.</p>
