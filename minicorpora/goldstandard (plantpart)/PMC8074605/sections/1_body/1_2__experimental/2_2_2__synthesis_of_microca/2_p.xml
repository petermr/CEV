<p>Preparation of EC microcapsules in steps:
 <list list-type="order">
  <list-item>
   <p>Dissolving or dispersing the substance (immortelle EO) together with a wall-forming material (ethyl cellulose, m = 0.6 g) in an organic solvent (ethyl acetate, V = 15 mL) of the type partially miscible with water to form an organic solution or dispersion;</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Mixing the organic solution or dispersion with an aqueous solution, the aqueous solution being saturated with the organic solvent (EA, V = 10 mL) dissolved in 100 mL of distilled water and containing an emulsifier (SDS, m = 1 g) to form an emulsion (the pH of the aqueous phase has been adjusted to pH 3 with citric acid to prevent hydrolysis of EA);</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>By mixing the aqueous phase on a magnetic stirrer, the organic phase is gradually added;</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Adding an excess amount of water (200 mL) to initiate the extraction of the organic solvent from the emulsion (10 min mixing on a magnetic stirrer);</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Mixing the emulsion long enough to allow formation of microcapsules in the mixture (centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min); and</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Further removal of the residual organic solvent and formed microcapsules by filtration.</p>
