<p>Surface characterization of the synthesized microcapsules was performed using Field Emission Scanning Electron microscope (MIRA\FE-SEM, Tescan, Czech Republic) operating at an accelerating voltage of 10.00 kV and magnification of 4×–1,000,000×. Prior to analysis, the samples were sputter coated with a chromium alloy (5 min). </p>
