<p>Spectrophotometric analysis of essential oil and synthesized microcapsules with three different oil masses (A = 0.15 g, B = 0.20 g, C = 0.30 g) and microcapsules without oil at 265 nm was performed. A calibration curve was prepared for quantitative analysis. To calculate the utilization of immortelle EO in the synthesis of microcapsules (B), this type of synthesis was repeated (B-2). Just before the end of the synthesis (after centrifugation), an aliquot of 0.5 mL was taken from the upper part of the solution and dissolved in 10 mL of hexane. The absorbance at a wavelength of 265 nm was measured using an absorption spectrophotometer. An unknown concentration of immortelle EO, which was not fully synthesized into a microcapsule, was calculated using the equation of a spectrophotometric calibration curve. Comparison of the concentrations of immortelle EO in the microcapsules (B-2) and in the residual solution resulted in utilization according to Equation (1).
