<p>This research is based on previous successful research by authors in the field of Î±-tocopherol encapsulating using solvent removal method [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-02390" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Microcapsules has spherical shape, smooth surface and that are important for controlled release and for the chemical stability of the core material [

 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-02390" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. So the aim of this study was to microencapsulate, using vapor evaporation technique, and characterize the essential oil of immortelle (lat. 
 <italic>Helichrysum italicum</italic>) in a microcapsule of ethyl cellulose because the major advantage of using microencapsulation technology is its ability to protect the active ingredients from hazardous environments, i.e., oxidization, heat, acidity, alkalinity, moisture, or evaporation [

There are many previous reports of essential oil encapsulation and some of them are based on: How to control the size distribution of capsules, establish that the essential oil was entrapped within the microcapsules rather than being adsorbed onto the surface, the influence of weight ratio of core and wall material, control the main variables (the sample-flow transfer rate, drying air-flow, and temperature) to obtain the best powder recovery and oil content [
