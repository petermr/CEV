<p>Pale yellow to colourless essential oils with strong citrus odour were obtained from the fresh leaf and peel of the three grapefruit varieties studied, with percentage yield (

 <xref rid="molecules-26-03387-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows the chemical compositions of the essential oils isolated from the fresh leaf and peel of the three grapefruit varieties. The GC-MS result analysis of the grapefruit fresh leaf and peel oils showed that they contained a variety of compounds. The main compounds from the peel oils of the three varieties studied were identified as 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene (87–90%), β-myrcene (2–4%) and γ-terpinene (0.05–2%). By contrast, β-phellandrene (90–91%), furanoid (0.6–2%) and caryophyllene (0.08–2%) were major compounds identified in the leaf oils. The predominance of 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene in the peel oils indicates that these waste peels can be used medicinally for the management of gallstones, as an appetite suppressant and in foods as flavouring agents [
