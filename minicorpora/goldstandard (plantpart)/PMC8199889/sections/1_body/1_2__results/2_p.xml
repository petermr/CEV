 <italic>Citrus paradisi</italic> peel and leaf essential oils from the three varieties studied here showed no mortality orally at dosage levels of 5000 mg/kg (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03387-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). FRPG had the highest significance, followed by FMPG and lastly FSPG (50–200 mg/kg). All the peel essential oils effectively reduced the egg albumin-induced paw oedema (

Although, in the negative group, oils reduced the egg albumin-induced paw oedema, their efficacy was lower than the efficacy visible in the positive control group (diclofenac), which signifies anti-inflammatory qualities. Moreover, diclofenac (a known standard drug) also reduced the egg albumin-induced paw oedema (
