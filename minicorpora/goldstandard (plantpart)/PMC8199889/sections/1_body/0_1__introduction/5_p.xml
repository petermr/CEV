<p>With increases in health awareness and quality of life, it has been suggested that grapefruit waste (leaf and peel) should be incorporated as an essential part of diet since it does not only provide nutritional supplements but also helps against risks of several illnesses [

South Africa is one of the main citrus producing countries and, according to the 2019 Citrus Market report, grapefruits production stands at 14% of the total citrus produced in the country, of which 13% are exported as fruit or as fruit juice. This activity/quantity leaves behind large amounts of leaves and peels as waste [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-26-03387" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Despite the acclaimed usage of grapefruit in other countries, in South Africa, the peel and the leaf of grapefruit are still considered as waste. This has also led to little or no attention being given to their therapeutic potential, aromatic chemical profiles, phytochemical constituents and their other potential uses in folklore medicine. Furthermore, there is little or no information on the various species found in South Africa to scientifically validate the medicinal use(s) of this plant. The safety profile of the grapefruits which are commonly used by communities have also not being reported hence the results obtained in this study will provide additional data on the phytochemistry, safety profile and biological activities of these valued “wastes”. This study therefore aims at determining the chemical composition of essential oils made from grapefruit leaf and peel, and evaluating their biological properties (anti-inflammatory and toxicity) in regard to their economic and medicinal value chains.
