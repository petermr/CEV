<p>Grapefruit (
 <italic>Citrus paradisi</italic>) is a subtropical tree that belongs to the Rutaceae family and is known for its sour to semi sweet fruit [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-26-03387" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It is a hybrid between sweet orange (
 <italic>Citrus sinensis</italic>) and pomelo (
 <italic>Citrus maxima</italic>). Grapefruit is commonly used in food and beverages, and in agriculture to kill bacteria and fungus [

 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-03387" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These three varieties of grapefruit have yellow-orange skin, grow up to 5–6 m tall and have dark green leaves that are about 15 cm thick. Their flesh is acidic, but the redder varieties are the sweetest (”Ruby Red” and ”Rose Pink”). Grapefruits are cultivated in the Limpopo, Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal provinces in South Africa, as they require warmer subtropical environments. They are sensitive to cold weather and can die off at freezing temperatures [
