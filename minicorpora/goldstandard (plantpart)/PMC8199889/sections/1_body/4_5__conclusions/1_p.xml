<p>The leaf and peel oils from the three cultivars of 
 <italic>Citrus paradisi</italic> studied have similar prominent compounds, although with slight variations in their percent composition. Biologically, these oils showed no mortality in mice during the toxicity study and demonstrated that they possess anti-inflammatory qualities. These perceived waste products have great potential and could be further studied for anti-inflammatory drug development, thus supporting the traditional application of this fruit for treating various illnesses, including inflammation.
