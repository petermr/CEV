<p>The extracted oils had a pleasant citrus aroma, which supports their use in cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries as flavouring agents. Limonene, the major constituent of the peel oil of the

 <italic>C. paradisi</italic> varieties have the same chemotype. Since there was no literature report on leaf oil composition, we are reporting that β-phellandrene was the dominating compound identified in the leaf oils of three varieties of 
 <italic>C. paradisi</italic> from South Africa. Our study also reveals the anti-inflammatory potential of the oils, with the “Rose Pink” peel oils having the highest and fastest efficacy compared to the other two varieties. Results indicate that “Rose Pink” peel oils are able to reduce inflammation within the first two hours, while “Ruby Red” and “White Marsh” are only effective after the 3rd and 4th h.
