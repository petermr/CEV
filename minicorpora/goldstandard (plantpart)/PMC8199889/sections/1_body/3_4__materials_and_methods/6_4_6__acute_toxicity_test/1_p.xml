<p>The essential oils obtained from the peel of the three varieties of grapefruits studied were used for the biological evaluation because of their higher yield and the presence of more compounds compared to the leaf oil (from the GC/MS analysis). The peel oil was individually emulsified with Tween 80 to obtain a maximum concentration of 5%

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-03387" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This was accomplished in 2 phases. The first phase consisted of three sub-groups with 3 animals each for the dose levels of 10, 100 and 1000 mg/kg, and a negative control group. The second phase involved 4 subgroups with 1 animal each per dose levels of 1000, 1600, 2900 and 5000 mg/kg, respectively, and a negative control group. Immediately after the treatment, each mouse was placed inside the Plexiglas cage and observed for immediate effects up to 30 min and thereafter for 24 h for lethal effects culminating in death. The LD
 <sub>50</sub> of the essential oils were estimated as the geometric mean of the lowest dose causing death and the highest dose causing no death.
