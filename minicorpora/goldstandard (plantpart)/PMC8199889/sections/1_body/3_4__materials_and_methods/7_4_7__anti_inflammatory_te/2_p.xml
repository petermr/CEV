<p>Animals were fasted and deprived of water for 18 h before the experiment in order to ensure uniform hydration and to reduce variability in response to oedema. A 5% Tween 80, Diclofenac, FRPG, FMPG and FSPG were orally administered to the groups. One hour post treatment, inflammation at the left hind paw was induced by injecting 0.1 mL of fresh egg albumin into the sub-plantar surface of the left hind paw in all rats. The fresh egg albumin was diluted in distilled water in 1:1 ratio. The paw diameters of the animals were measured with a digital caliper. Repeated weighing was carried out. Baseline paw diameters were recorded. Hourly readings were taken after the egg albumin was introduced up to 5 h.</p>
