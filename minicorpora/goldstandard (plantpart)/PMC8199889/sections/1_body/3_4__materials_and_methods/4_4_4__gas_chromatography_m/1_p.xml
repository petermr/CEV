<p>GC-MS analyses of the oils were performed on a Bruker 450 Gas Chromatograph connected to a 300 MS/MS mass spectrometer system operating in EI mode at 70 eV. It was equipped with an HP-5 MS fused silica capillary system with 5% phenylmethylsiloxane stationary phase. The capillary column parameter was 30 m by 0.25 mm, with film thickness of 0.25 µm. The initial temperature of the column was 50 °C and was heated to 240 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min; the final temperature was kept at 450 °C for a run time of 66.25 min. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The split ratio was 100:1. Scan time was 78 min with a scanning range of 35 to 450 amu. One microliter (1 µL) of the diluted oil (in hexane) was injected for analysis. N-Alkane of C8 to C30 was run using the same Kovats indices. The constituents were identified using GC retention indices obtained in our group library, along with those in the literature [
