<p id="Par61">In this assay, 9 mL of Tris-HCI buffer (pH 8.2, 50 mM L
 <sup>−1</sup>) was poured into a test tube and it was incubated in a hot bath at 25 °C for 20 min. Then, 40 µL of pyrogal solution (45 mM L
 <sup>−1</sup> of pyrogallol in 10 mM L
 <sup>−1</sup> of hydrochloric acid) that was already incubated at 25 °C was injected into the top part of the test tube with a 1-µL syringe and was mixed with it. The mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 3 min, immediately after which it was added with 1 drop of ascorbic acid to stop the reaction. The absorbance of the mixture at 420 nm was recorded as
