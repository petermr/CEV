<p id="Par50">Ten plants from each plot were randomly sampled to record their morphological traits on July 9, 2017, after eliminating marginal effects (marginal effects: for plant sampling, the middle rows of each plot are usually used and the side rows are not considered (eliminating marginal effects) because they are exposed to all kinds of damage, pests and diseases and can negatively affect the result of the analysis.). Plant height and branch diameter, capsule number per plant, the number of auxiliary branches, seed yield per plant, and 1000-seed weight were measured.</p>
