 </sup> To determine flavonoid content, 20 µL of the plant extract was diluted with 1 mL of distilled water and was added with 0.075 mL of sodium nitrite (5%). Five minutes after the reaction, 0.15 mL of aluminum chloride (10%) was added and after 6 min, 0.5 mL of sodium hydroxide (1 mol L
 <sup>−1</sup>) was added and its final volume was adjusted to 3 mL. Then, its absorbance was read at 510 nm with a spectrophotometer.
