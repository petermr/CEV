<p id="Par27">Many researchers have shown that biofertilizers enhance nutrient uptake by increasing root growth and development and solubilization and mineralization of soil nutrient sources such as phosphorus (P). The increase in plant height by P application can be attributed to the fact that P increases N uptake by the positive effects on root elongation

 </sup>. Biofertilizers also stimulate the synthesis of phytohormones such as auxins, different amino acids, antibiotics, hydrogen cyanide, and siderophores. They also increase nitrogen fixation in the rhizosphere, resulting in an increase in the length of the internode and ultimately boosting the growth and height of such plants as corn and marigolds
