 </sup> reported an increase in essential oil yield in the plants treated with combined N and biofertilizers versus the control in both cultivation seasons. Volatile organic compounds are involved in a plant defense system and can be influenced by environmental microorganisms. Research has shown that the application of rhizobacteria such as Bacillus and Pseudomonas strains boosted volatile compounds content
