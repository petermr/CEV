<p id="Par7">The highest plant height (31.80 cm) was obtained from the plants inoculated with (NPKb) + U50% vis-à-vis the control plants (26.93 cm). The treatment of (NPKb) + U50% significantly differed from all the treatments except (Nb) + U50% and U. The comparison of the means for the treatments showed that (NPKb) + U50% and (Nb) + U50% increased plant height by 18.06% and 15.84% versus the control (Fig.
