<p id="Par13">The treatment of (NPKb) + U50% and the control showed the highest and lowest harvest index of 36.45 and 25.31%, respectively. The treatment of (NPKb) + U50% did not show a significant difference from the treatment of (Pb) + U50%. Furthermore, (NPKb) + U50% and (Pb) + U50% increased harvest index versus the control by 44.02% and 41.01%, respectively (Fig.
