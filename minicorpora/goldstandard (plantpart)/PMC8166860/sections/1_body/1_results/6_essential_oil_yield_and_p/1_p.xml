<p id="Par15">The highest essential oil yield was observed in (NPKb) + U50% (5.44 kg ha
 <sup>−1</sup>) and the lowest in the control (1.72 kg ha
 <sup>−1</sup>). There was no significant difference between the (NPKb) + U50% and (Pb) + U50% treatments. The (NPKb) + U50% and (Pb) + U50% treatments increased essential oil yield by 302.59 and 289.32%, respectively when compared to the control treatment (Fig.
