<p id="Par12">The treatment of (NPKb) + U50% was related to the highest 1000-seed weight of 3.24 g as compared to the control plants (2.92 g). The treatment of (NPKb) + U50% did not differ from the treatments of (NPKb), U, (Pb) and (Pb) + U50% significantly. The increase in the 1000-seed weight of the plants treated with (NPKb) + U50% and (NPKb) was 10.95% and 9.70% vis-à-vis the control, respectively (Fig.
