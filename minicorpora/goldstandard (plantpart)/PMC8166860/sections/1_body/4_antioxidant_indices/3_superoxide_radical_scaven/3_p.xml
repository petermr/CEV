<p id="Par41">Antioxidants can mitigate the oxidative damage directly via reacting with free radicals or indirectly by inhibiting the activity or expression of free radicals. They also act as chain breakers, scavenging chain initiating radicals, quenching singlet oxygen, and chelating prooxidative metal ions

 </sup>. The positive and significant correlation of phenolic compounds and flavonoids with free-radical scavenging activity is demonstrated in the turmeric rhizosphere used bio-inoculants

 </sup>. Biofertilizers have been proven to increase the solubility of the elements and make them accessible to the roots. Also, biofertilizers increase the available iron by producing siderophores, and in general, enhance the primary and secondary metabolites of the plants, thereby increasing phenols and flavonoids, which can scavenge free radicals and also increase the inhibition of nitric oxide and superoxide radicals. Increasing the activity of the shikimic acid pathway and the activity of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) as key enzymes in the phenol synthesis can stimulate the synthesis of phenols and flavonoids and thus inhibit radicals, in which biofertilizers play an important role

 </sup>. In other words, antioxidants increase the inhibition of nitric oxide and superoxide radicals. These antioxidants are said chain-breaking antioxidants, which reduce the chain reaction and increase chain breakage. Hence, it can be interpreted that the combination of bio-chemical fertilizers increases the amount of antioxidants, such as phenols and flavonoids. These control the free radicals and increase primary and secondary metabolites and can play an effective role in stimulating the plant protective system.
