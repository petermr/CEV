<p id="Par40">The measurement of the chain breaking activity determines the rate of radical scavenging as influenced by electron-transferring and hydrogen-donating antioxidants, which is in accordance with our results. The chain-breaking has a correlation with the amount of antioxidants that are boosted by biofertilizers. Therefore, the measurement of these parameters together can be an interesting way to estimate the antioxidant capacity of a compound
