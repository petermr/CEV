<p id="Par36">There is a large number of published studies reporting that biological fertilizers such as Rhizobium bacteria, AM (
 <italic>arbuscular mycorrhiza</italic>), and PGPR, alone or in combination with chemical fertilizers increase phenolic and flavonoid content through enhancing the interaction of soil microbes and plant roots

 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> increased peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase enzymes in tomato, which play a key role in the metabolism of phenols and flavonoids. Biofertilizers in combination or alone can increase the amount of biochemical compounds of plants, such as phenols and flavonoids, as has been seen in mung and basil plants because multi-biofertilizers usually act as growth-promoting rhizobacteria. The combination of biofertilizers with compost increases the biochemical properties of the plants compared to organic and inorganic fertilizers
