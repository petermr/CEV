<p id="Par2">The detrimental impacts of chemical drugs have drawn the attention of medical circles to herbal drugs. On the other hand, since the overuse of chemical pesticides and fertilizers may adversely influence the quantity and quality of the active ingredients in medicinal plants, many pharmaceutical companies prefer raw materials produced by agrochemical-free farming or organic farming practices

 </sup>. Besides the economic value of medicinal plants, they are adaptive to organic farming practices

 </sup>. So, the adverse effects on their medicinal quality can be alleviated by producing them by organic practices

 </sup>. Extensive efforts have focused on finding appropriate solutions for improving soil quality, agricultural products, and the removal of pollutants. Indeed, new farming techniques are required to mitigate these environmental hazards and enhance crop yields. One of these techniques is the evaluation of living and active soil communities to identify beneficial soil microorganisms and use them as biofertilizers

 </sup>. Chemical fertilizers may pose many problems if they are not applied properly, such as the reduction of plant response to fertilizers, environmental problems, adverse effects on crop and food quality, the loss of soil fertility, the contamination of water supply sources, which would endanger human health, the depletion of non-renewable resources, such as phosphate rocks, and eventually the reduction of plant resistance to pests and diseases

 </sup>. A fundamental principle in sustainable agriculture is the use of biofertilizers in agricultural ecosystems to significantly reduce the application of chemical fertilizer inputs
