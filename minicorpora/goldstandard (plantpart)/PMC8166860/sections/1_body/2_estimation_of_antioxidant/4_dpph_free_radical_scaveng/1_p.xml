<p id="Par21">The plants treated with (NPKb) + U50% showed the highest DPPH free radical scavenging rate of 33.47% versus 18.63% recorded in the control plants. The difference of the treatment of (NPKb) + U50% was statistically significant from the other treatments. The plants treated with (NPKb) + U50% and (Pb) + U50% showed 79.60% and 56.35% higher DPPH free radical scavenging rate than the control, respectively (Fig.
