<p id="Par26">The highest and lowest leaf P contents of 0.41% were observed in the plants treated with (NPKb) + U50%. The treatment of (NPKb) + U50% differed from all other treatments significantly. But, the difference of (Pb) + U50% with (Pb) and (NPKb) was not statistically significant. According to the comparison of the means, the treatments of (NPKb) + U50% and (Pb) + U50% resulted in 78.19% and 58.10% higher leaf P content than the control, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>b). The (NPKb) + U50% treatment resulted in the highest leaf K content (2.82%). The treatment of (NPKb) + U50% differed from the other treatments significantly. The comparison of the means revealed that the treatments of (NPKb) + U50% and (Kb) + U50% enhanced seed K content by 61.64% and 49.61% versus the control, respectively (Fig.
