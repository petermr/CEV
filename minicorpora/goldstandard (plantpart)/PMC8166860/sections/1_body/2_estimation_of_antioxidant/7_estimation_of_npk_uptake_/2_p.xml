<p id="Par25">The treatment of U resulted in the highest leaf N content (1.44%). The treatment of U did not differ from the treatments of (NPKb) + U50% and (Nb) + U50% significantly. Based on the comparison of the means, the treatments of U and (NPKb) + U50% enhanced leaf N content by 251.21% and 244.71% compared with the control, respectively (Fig.
