<p id="Par19">The plants treated with (NPKb) + U50% showed the highest amount of flavonoids (1.95 mg gallic acid g
 <sup>−1</sup> DM) in contrast to the control treatment with the flavonoid content of 1.40 mg gallic acid g
 <sup>−1</sup> DM, which was the lowest. The difference of the treatment of (NPKb) + U50% with the other treatments was statistically significant. The treatment of (Pb) + U50% showed insignificant differences with the treatment of (Nb) + U50%. According to the comparison of means, the application of (NPKb) + U50%, (Pb) + U50%, and (Nb) + U50% increased total flavonoid content by 39.28%, 30.23% and 26.6%, respectively versus the control (Fig.
