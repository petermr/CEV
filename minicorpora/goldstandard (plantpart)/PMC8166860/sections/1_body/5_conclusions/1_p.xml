<p id="Par45">The use of biofertilizers alone or in combination with chemical fertilizer improved the quantitative and qualitative traits of black cumin. The results showed that U fertilizer increased biological yield and (Pb) + U50% enhanced essential oil percentage, while (NPKb) + U50% had the best performance in terms of plant height, branch diameter, capsule (follicle) number per plant, number of auxiliary branches, seed yield per plant, thousand-seed weight, harvest index, essential oil yield, total phenolic compounds, flavonoids content, DPPH free radical scavenging assay, nitric oxide (NO) radical, superoxide radical scavenging assay, and chain-breaking activity. In total, the use of biofertilizers and 50% urea, which reduce the use of chemical fertilizer by half, would be in line with sustainable agriculture.</p>
