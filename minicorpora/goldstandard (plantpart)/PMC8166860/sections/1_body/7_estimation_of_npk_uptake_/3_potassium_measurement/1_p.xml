<p id="Par66">To determine 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> potassium content, 1 g of dry ground and meshed sample was placed in a furnace at 550 °C for 24 h. After digestion by dry burning method (with HCL), the samples were adjusted to 100 mL using distilled water. Using a Clinical pfp7 flame photometer, first potassium standards and then the main samples were read by the flame emission method. To prepare the standard, 9.53 g of potassium chloride was solved in water and its volume was adjusted in a 1-L volumetric flask (thick standard). Then, for a series of standard solutions, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, and 0 mL of the thick standard was poured into 100-mL volumetric flasks containing 50 mL of water and 4.5 mL of thick sulfuric acid, and it was adjusted to the desired volume.
