<p id="Par65">To measure 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> phosphorus content, 1 g of the sample was ground and meshed. After it was digested by dry burning (with HCL), it was adjusted to 100 mL by adding distilled water. Then, 5 mL of the sample was mixed with 5 mL of yellow solution (ammonium heptamolybdate + ammonium vanadate) and then, its volume was increased to 25 mL by adding distilled water. After 0.5 h, the samples were filtered through a filter paper and the resulting extract was read at 470 nm with a spectrophotometer. First, phosphorus standards and then the main samples were read. To prepare the standard, 2.19 g of KH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub> was first solved in a slight amount of water and was adjusted in volume in a 1-L volumetric flask (thick standard). For the series of standard solutions, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, and 0 mL of the thick standard was taken, added with 5 mL of zinc molybdate ammonium, and adjusted to 25 mL.
