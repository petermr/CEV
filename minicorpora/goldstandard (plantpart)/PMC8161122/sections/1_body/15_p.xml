<p>Secondary metabolites biosynthesized by plant should not only be seen as potential pharmacological agents. Hossen et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-foods-10-01131" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] demonstrate the allelopathic effect of 
 <italic>Wedelia chinensis</italic> (Osbeck). Extracts of 
 <italic>Wedelia chinensis</italic> exhibited high inhibitory activity against the root and shoot growth of cress, alfalfa, rapeseed, lettuce, foxtail fescue, Italian ryegrass, timothy, and barnyard grass and could be used for the biological control of weeds. Vanillic acid and gallic acid, isolated from the aqueous methanol extracts significantly arrested the growth of cress and Italian ryegrass seedlings. The concentrations of vanillic acid and gallic acid needed for 50% inhibition (I
 <sub>50</sub> values) of the seedling growth of the cress and Italian ryegrass were 0.04–15.4 and 0.45–6.6 mM, respectively.
