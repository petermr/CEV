<p>Celastrol and pristimerin are two quinone-methide triterpenes isolated from species of Celastraceae family, which exhibit various biological activities such as cytotoxic, anti-obesity, and antidiabetic. In addition to the already known biological activities of these two natural compounds present in many species consumed in different world regions for their stimulating properties, Padilla-Monta√±o et al. [
 <xref rid="B1-foods-10-01131" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] demonstrate for the first time the superior antibacterial effect of celastrol against 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, when compared to pristimerin activity. Furthermore, they clarify the action mechanism of celastrol and its ability to act on multiple targets.
