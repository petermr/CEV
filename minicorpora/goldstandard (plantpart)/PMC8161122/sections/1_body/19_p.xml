<p>In turn, Malarz et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-foods-10-01131" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] study chemical constituents of the leaves from the old cultivar of asparagus lettuce (
 <italic>Lactuca sativa</italic> var. 
 <italic>angustana</italic> cv. Gr√ºner Stern) and compare them with those existing in other lettuce varieties, including wild lettuce. HPLC/DAD and 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR analysis of the methanolic extract of asparagus lettuce led to identification of five apocarotenoids, three sesquiterpene lactones, two lignans, five caffeic acid derivatives, and three flavonoids, some of which reported now for the first time in 
 <italic>L. sativa</italic>. Stems, leaves and shoot tips of this variety were also examined to assess their phenolics and sesquiterpene lactone content, as well as DPPH scavenging activity. The results suggest that the leaves of the plant are the richest in antioxidant compounds. The investigated plant material, in terms of polyphenolic content and antioxidative activity, was similar to modern leafy cultivars of 
 <italic>L. sativa</italic>.
