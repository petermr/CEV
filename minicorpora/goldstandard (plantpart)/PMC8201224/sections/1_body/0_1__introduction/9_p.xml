<p>The aims of this study were to investigate on the changes in content of bioactive compounds of rosemary plant and to evaluate their activity against some typical rosemary pathogens. Specific objectives were: (i) to determine variation in total concentrations and relative contents of terpenes and phenols among different types of tissue (foliar, cortical and xylem), (ii) to investigate the effects of tissue age on the content of terpenes and phenols, (iii) to determine enantiomeric terpene distribution within-plant and (iv) to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of selected terpenic compounds (including some chiral monoterpenes) and rosmarinic acid, against the fungus 
 <italic>Alternaria alternata</italic> and the bacterium 
 <italic>Pseudomonas viridiflava</italic>. These pathogens are known to induce heavy damages on aerial parts of the rosemary plants, causing important economic losses in nursery [

A better knowledge on terpenes and phenolic content in the different tissues can be useful for a more targeted harvesting of rosemary plants, in order to produce high-quality essential oils and phenolic extracts. At the same time, knowledge of antimicrobial properties of rosemary tissue components can be usefully applied for breeding programs aimed to select less susceptible chemotypes to pest and diseases and to produce eco-friendly formulates, alternatives to synthetic pesticides, less harmful to human and environmental health.
