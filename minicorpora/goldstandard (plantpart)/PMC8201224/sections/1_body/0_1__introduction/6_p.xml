<p>Chemo-systematic studies showed that the total absolute amounts of monoterpenes of essential oils and resins can be influenced by abiotic factors, while the relative percentages of constitutive monoterpenes in mature tissues are under strong genetic control and scarcely affected by abiotic stresses [
