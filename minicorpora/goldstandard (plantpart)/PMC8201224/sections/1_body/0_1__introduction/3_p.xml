<p>Rosemary is used not only to obtain essential oils but also to produce phenolic leaf extracts containing a pool of compounds responsible for several biological properties, as demonstrated by in vitro experiments and in vivo animal tests [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Three main groups of phenolic compounds characterize these extracts: rosmarinic acid, a group of minor flavonoids and phenolic diterpenes such as carnosic acid and carnosol. The main bioactivities related to these phenolic compounds are anti-inflammatory [
