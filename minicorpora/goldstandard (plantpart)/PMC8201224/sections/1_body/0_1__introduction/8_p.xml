<p>Although monoterpenes are widely studied as the main constituents of essential oils, based on our knowledge, there are very few studies on enantiomeric monoterpenes of rosemary. Particularly, two and four works on chiral monoterpenes respectively in foliar tissues [

 <xref rid="B32-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] were reported in the literature. It should be pointed out that this is the first study showing enantiomeric variations of rosemary monoterpenes in different tissues of different age, and these variations are known to play different ecological roles and induce different sensorial perceptions [
