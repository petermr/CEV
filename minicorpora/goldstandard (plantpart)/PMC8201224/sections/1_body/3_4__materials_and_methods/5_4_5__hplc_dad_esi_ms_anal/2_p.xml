<p>The quantitative evaluation of the main phenolic constituents was performed using three external standards: rosmarinic acid at 330 nm, genkwanin at 350 nm and carnosic acid at 284 nm. Genkwanin was used at 350 nm to quantify the flavonoids, while carnosic acid to determine the non-volatile diterpenoids. The calibration curve of rosmarinic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany)) was in a linearity range between 0.1 and 1.8 μg, with R
 <sup>2</sup> 0.9998, the calibration curve of carnosic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) was in the linearity range of 0.05–3.06 μg, with R
 <sup>2</sup> 0.9998, and a five-point calibration curve of genkwanin (purity grade ≥ 95% by Extrasynthese) was obtained (range 0.01 to 0.85 μg), with an R
 <sup>2</sup> 0.9999.
