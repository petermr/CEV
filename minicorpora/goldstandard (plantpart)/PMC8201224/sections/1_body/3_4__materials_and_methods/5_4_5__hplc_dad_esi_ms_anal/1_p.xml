<p>The analyses were carried out using a HP 1100 L liquid chromatograph equipped with a DAD detector, coupled to a HP 1100 MSD mass spectrometer with an API/electrospray interface (all from Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The analysis conditions were the same as those described in our previous study [

 <xref rid="B49-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. A Fusion RP18 column (150 × 2 mm i.d., 4 μm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) was used and the mobile phases were (A) 0.1% formic acid/water and (B) CH
 <sub>3</sub>CN. The multi-step linear solvent gradient was: 0–15 min 15–25% B; 15–25 min, 25–35% B; 25–35 min 35–50% B; 35–40 min 50–100% B, with a final plateau of 8 min at 100% B, flow rate 0.2 mL·min
 <sup>−1</sup> and oven temperature 26 °C, with an injection volume of 5 μL.
