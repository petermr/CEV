<p>PDA was prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions, autoclaved at 121 °C for 15 min and poured into Petri dishes. After the medium solidification, two wells of 0.5 cm diameter were cut at the opposite side of the agar plates using a cork borer and 20 µL of the liquid or 20 µg of the solid compounds were placed into the wells. Twenty µL of sterile distilled water (SDW) was placed into the wells of control plates. Then, a 0.5 cm disk cut from the edge of the 
 <italic>A. alternata</italic> colony was placed in the middle of each Petri dish. Three plates for each treatment were prepared. Plates were sealed with three layers of parafilm, incubated at 25 °C and monitored for two weeks. To evaluate the inhibition activity of the tested compounds against 
 <italic>A. alternata</italic>, two diameters were measured for each fungal colony and data were compared to the diameter size of the control (SDW).
