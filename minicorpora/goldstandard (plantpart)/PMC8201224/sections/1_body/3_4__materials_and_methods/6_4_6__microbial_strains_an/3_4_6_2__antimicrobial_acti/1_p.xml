<p>The 48 h-old culture of 
 <italic>P. viridiflava</italic> was used to prepare a bacterial suspension in saline solution (0.8% NaCl). The bacterial concentration of the suspension was measured by a spectrophotometer and adjusted to an optical density of 0.1 at 530 nm, corresponding to 1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> cfu/mL, and 1.5 mL of the suspension was mixed with 15 mL of NGA medium poured into the Petri dishes. After the medium solidification, two wells of 0.5 cm diameter were cut at the opposite side of the agar plates using a cork borer, and then 20 µL of the liquid or 20 µg of the solid compounds were placed into the wells. Plates with 20 µL of SDW in the wells were used as controls of bacterial growth. Three plates for each treatment were prepared. Plates were sealed with three layers of parafilm and then incubated at 27 °C for 48 h. The antibacterial activity of the tested compounds was evaluated measuring the size of the growth inhibition halo surrounding the wells.
