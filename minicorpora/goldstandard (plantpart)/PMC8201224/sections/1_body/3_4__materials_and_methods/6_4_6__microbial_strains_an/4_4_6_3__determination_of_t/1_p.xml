 <italic>A. alternata</italic>: The 96-well microplate dilution method reported by Hassan and Cutter [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] was used for (+)-α-pinene, (−)-β-pinene, verbenone, rosmarinic acid and copper sulphate, while for borneol, and the two camphor enantiomers that were not soluble in the liquid growth medium, the protocol described above (
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4dot6dot1-molecules-26-03425">Section 4.6.1</xref>) was used to determine the MIC. For the microdilution method, the fungus was grown on PDA plates for one week, then conidia were collected by scraping the agar surface and suspended in potato dextrose broth (PDB). Conidia were enumerated by a hemocytometer and concentration was adjusted to 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> conidia/mL. The antimicrobial compounds were dissolved in methanol to obtain a 10% solution. This solution was serially diluted 1:1 in PDB until the concentration of 0.039% [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. One hundred µL of each dilution were placed in the microplate wells, then 100 µL of the conidial suspension was added to each well. Each dilution was tested in triplicate. The positive control was represented by 100 µL of the conidial suspension plus 100 µL of PDB, while the negative control consisted of 200 µL of sterile PDB. A control to test methanol inhibition activity was also carried out. Plates were incubated at 25 °C for 48 h and fungal growth was determined both by visual reading and by a spectrophotometer at 450 nm. The MIC value for the two camphor enantiomers and borneol was considered as the highest dilution of each compound that determines a significant reduction of the growth of
