 <italic>P. viridiflava</italic>: The 96-well microplate dilution method was used for all compounds. The bacterium was grown for 48 h in plates containing NGA medium, then the bacterial suspension was prepared in nutrient broth amended with 0.25% glucose (NGB) following the procedure described in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4dot6dot2-molecules-26-03425">Section 4.6.2</xref>. On the basis of the results obtained from the test of in vitro antimicrobial activity, only the compounds that were active against 
 <italic>P. viridiflava</italic> (i.e., (+)-α-pinene, verbenone and rosmarinic acid) were assayed for the MIC determination. Only the enantiomer (+)-α-pinene was tested, since inhibition activity had resulted not different for the two forms of this compound. The dilutions of the different compounds and next steps of the procedure were the same of that previously reported for 
 <italic>A. alternata</italic>, using NGB as a growth medium. The positive control was represented by 100 µL of the bacterial suspension plus 100 µL of NGB, while the negative control consisted of 200 µL of sterile NGB. A control to test methanol inhibition activity was also carried out. Plates were incubated at 27 °C for 24 h, then the bacterial growth was first recorded by a visual reading of the plates. Then, 30 µL of a resazurin solution (0.015%) was added to each well and plates were incubated for 3 h at 27 °C. The color of the suspensions contained in each well was recorded.
