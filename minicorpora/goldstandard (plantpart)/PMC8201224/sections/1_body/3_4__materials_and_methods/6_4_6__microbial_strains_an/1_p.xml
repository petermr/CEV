 <italic>Alternaria alternata</italic> and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas viridiflava</italic> strains belong to the microbial collection of the IPSP-CNR, Florence (Italy). The fungus 
 <italic>A. alternata</italic> was grown on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA, Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, UK) plates for 1 week at 25 °C. The bacterium 
 <italic>P. viridiflava</italic> was grown on Nutrient Agar (Oxoid Ltd., UK) amended with 2.5 g/L of glucose (NGA) for 48 h at 27 °C. PDA and NGA media were also used to test the inhibition activity against the two pathogens of the main terpenic and phenolic compounds of rosemary leaf identified in this study. The selected compounds were: (+)-borneol, (−)-borneol, (+)-camphor, (−)-camphor, β-caryophillene, (+)-α-pinene, (−)-α-pinene, (+)-β-pinene, (−)-β-pinene, (−)-verbenone and rosmarinic acid. Copper sulphate was used as a positive control for both pathogens. The agar well-diffusion method was used to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the different compounds [
