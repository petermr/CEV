<p>Fresh leaves, cortical and xylem tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground into a porous ceramic mortar (grinding time about 1 min). The grinding is made to allow the breakdown of cellular structures containing terpenic constituents, avoiding the loss of these substances, which are extremely volatile. For each sample, 0.5 g of fresh ground material was extracted with 3 mL of 
 <italic>n</italic>-pentane, using tridecane as an internal standard. The extraction process was performed for 24 h in a shaker at 1000 rpm at 24 °C. The extract, filtered through 0.45 μm filters, was stored in vials at −20 °C before GC/FID analysis. Otherwise, 0.5 g of material was ground in liquid nitrogen and placed in vials for the GC/MS analysis.
