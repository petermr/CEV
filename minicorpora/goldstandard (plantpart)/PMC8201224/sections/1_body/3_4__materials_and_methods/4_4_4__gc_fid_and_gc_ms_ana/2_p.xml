<p>To obtain the separation of the enantiomeric monoterpenes, an Elite-Betacydex Betacyclodextrin capillary column (Perkin Elmer Italia S.p.A., Milano (MI), Italy), 30 m long and 0.25 mm in diameter, was used. GC analysis was carried out using hydrogen as a carrier gas at 2.0 mL·min
 <sup>–1</sup> by a flame ionization detector at 250 °C and at injector temperature of 230 °C. The oven temperature programming started at 40 °C for 3 min and increased to 200 °C, at 1 °C·min
 <sup>–1</sup>, and the final temperature of 200 °C was maintained for 10 min. Volatile terpenes were identified by comparison of their retention times with those of standards under the same conditions. High-purity components were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany). Absolute amounts of terpenoids (total concentrations) were determined by comparison with the tridecane internal standard, and expressed as mg g
 <sup>–1</sup> fresh weight (FW). Relative amount (proportion or percentage) of each monoterpene was expressed as a percentage of total monoterpenes (monoterpene profiles), while each sesquiterpene was calculated as a percentage of total monoterpenes plus sesquiterpenes (terpene profiles).
