<p>Headspace Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (HS-GC/MS) was then performed on a GC/MS system (Perkin Elmer Italia S.p.A., Milano (MI), Italy) composed of a GC AutoSystem XL coupled to a TurboMass mass spectrometer and combined with a TurboMatrix 40 automatic headspace sampler. The gas chromatograph was equipped with the column described above, operating with helium as a carrier gas at a constant flow of 3 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>. The oven program was as follows: the initial temperature was 40 °C for 3 min, then a ramp of 1 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> brought the final temperature to 200 °C. The inlet temperature was 200 °C. The mass spectrometer was operating with an electron ionization of 70 eV, scanning the mass range from 35 to 350

The mass spectrometer was calibrated using perfluorotributhylamine, as the calibration standard, with the Chemstation software.
