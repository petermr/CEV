<p>The content of phenolic compounds was reported only for leaf samples, since extracts from cortical and xylem tissues showed traces or negligible amounts of caffeic acid derivatives and flavonoids. The main phenols of this plant, rosmarinic acid and carnosic acid and its derivatives, were not significantly different between the leaf tissues of the two different ages. Young and mature leaf samples showed differences in the content of isoorientin, homoplantaginin (hispidulin 7-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside), cirsimaritin and genkwanin. Our data partially agree with the study by Yosr et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], showing that polyphenols were mainly accumulated in leaves and flavonoids did not vary significantly during different growth stages of the leaves.
