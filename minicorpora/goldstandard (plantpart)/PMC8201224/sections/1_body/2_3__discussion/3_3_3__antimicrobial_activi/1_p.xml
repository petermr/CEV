<p>Antimicrobial activity of rosemary essential oil and its components has been widely investigated against several pathogens of clinical origin, spreading mainly as food contaminants and responsible for dangerous diseases to humans, and some plant pathogens [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. To our knowledge, however, the antimicrobial activity of rosemary essential oil compounds has not yet been evaluated against the fungus 
 <italic>A. alternata</italic> and the bacterium 
 <italic>P. viridiflava</italic>, two polyphagous plant pathogens able to infect rosemary plants [

 <xref rid="B34-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The two species were tested for their sensitivity to rosmarinic acid and to the terpenic compounds identified in this study as the main components of rosemary essential oil. Except for β-caryophyllene and (−)-β-pinene, the remaining seven compounds showed a significative antifungal activity, that in the case of camphor and (−)-verbenone, inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>A. alternata</italic> at the same rate as copper sulphate, a compound commonly used as a pesticide to control bacterial and fungal pathogens and allowed in organic farming [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. On the other hand, the bacterium 
 <italic>P. viridiflava</italic> was inhibited only by the two α-pinene enantiomers, (−)-verbenone and rosmarinic acid. However, their efficacy was significantly lower than copper sulphate. It is known that Gram-negative bacteria (including 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species) show low sensitivity to the antimicrobial activity of terpenic compounds, since their outer membrane contains hydrophilic polysaccharides (LPS) which create a barrier towards macromolecules and hydrophobic compounds [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This could explain the negative response of 
 <italic>P. viridiflava</italic> to most of the terpenes assayed in this study. Rosmarinic acid, that is a naturally occurring phenolic compound in a number of plants belonging to the 
 <italic>Lamiaceae</italic> family, showed a certain effectiveness against both the plant pathogens tested in this study, in which it induced the production of a dark-brown diffusible pigment. Indeed, some microbial species are able to produce the dark pigment melanin through the activation of the enzyme laccase that catalyzes the oxidative polymerization of phenolic compounds. The activation of melanin synthesis is known as a cell survival mechanism for several micro-organisms [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Most probably, the dark-brown pigment secreted in the growth medium by 
 <italic>A. alternata</italic> and 
 <italic>P. viridiflava</italic> is a melanin-like compound produced by the two pathogens as a defense mechanism against rosmarinic acid. In fact, both pathogens were inhibited in the growth but not devitalized by rosmarinic acid. Since polyphenols are produced in plants to prevent microbial infections, it is conceivable that during host–pathogen co-evolution, a resistance mechanism (laccase synthesis) was transferred from the plant to the pathogen. This hypothesis is supported by phylogenetic studies that have evidenced that the fungal laccases are closely related to plant laccases [
