<p>Results obtained from the antimicrobial tests performed in this study highlight new possible strategies to control the two rosemary pathogens in the nursery: rosemary varieties at high content of (−)-verbenone and α-pinene should be less sensitive to the attack of the two pathogenic species considered in this study, then a selection on the basis of terpene profile could help to screen among the available commercial rosemary genotypes for resistance to pathogens. Copper-based formulates are widely used in conventional as well as in organic farming. However, repeated and excessive use of copper can lead to accumulation in soil, where it is toxic to many macro- and micro-organisms, while the accumulation in the food web may determine toxicity to humans [

Results regarding the antimicrobial activity of terpenic compounds obtained in this study are very promising, however further studies are needed for the development of terpene-based formulates. The development of new verbenone/α-pinene-based formulates may represent an alternative way to use the available chemical pesticides for controlling rosemary pathogens and most probably also other bacterial and fungal plant pathogens. The inclusion of terpenes in a solid matrix should extend the release time and enhance the water solubility of these highly volatile hydrophobic compounds [
