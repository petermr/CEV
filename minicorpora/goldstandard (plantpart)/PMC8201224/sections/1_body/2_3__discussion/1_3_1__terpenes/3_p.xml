<p>It is worth noting that rosemary essential oil production is usually obtained via steam distillation of small branches with young and mature leaves of the current seasonâ€™s growth. Our data showed that leaf tissues represented over half (about 66%) of the total biomass of branches, followed by xylem tissues (about 24%) and cortical tissues (about 10%). Therefore, leaves representing the major source of biomass with the highest TCT are the organs that contribute to a greater extent to the chemical profile of essential oil and its final quality.</p>
