<p>Few reports regarding studies on the variations in terpene profiles between young and mature tissues are available, and most of these works are related to leaf tissue. In this study, it was shown that the highest contents of (+)/(−)-β-pinene, (−)-bornylacetate, β-caryophyllene and α-humulene were detected in young leaf samples, while mature leaves showed high relative content of (−)-verbenone (
