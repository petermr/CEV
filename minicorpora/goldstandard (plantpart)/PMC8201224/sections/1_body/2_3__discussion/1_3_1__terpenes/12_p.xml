<p>According to the terpene profiles of leaves (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03425-f003">Figure 3</xref>), the plants used in this study can be classified as an α-pinene chemotype of 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L., known to be widely present in Italy and Morocco [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Previous reports indicate that verbenone has also been used to define the verbenone chemotype, and the rosemary essential oil called 
 <italic>verbenoniferum</italic> is described as containing over 15% of this terpene [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Even in mature leaves, that showed the maximum concentration for this compound, (−)-verbenone always remained below 13.1% of the total volatile terpenes.
