<p>Variations in the enantiomeric composition of several monoterpenes occurred between various tissue sources at different developmental stages. It must be pointed out that until now, no information on enantiomeric distribution has been available for cortex and xylem tissues of rosemary. This current study shows that (+)-α-pinene was the predominant enantiomer, in agreement with data in the literature [

 <xref rid="B31-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. For the other monoterpenes, the enantiomeric distribution detected in our samples were partially in agreement with data in the literature. (−)-camphene and (−)-linalool were the predominant enantiomers, in agreement with data on fresh leaf samples reported by Larkov et al. [

 <xref rid="B31-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] found (+)-camphene and (+)-linalool to be dominant. In our data, no enantiomeric excess was observed for limonene, in agreement with that reported by Satyal et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], while this monoterpene was enantiomerically pure, 100% (+)-limonene and 100% (−)-limonene, as described in the studies by Tomi et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and Yassa and Williams [
