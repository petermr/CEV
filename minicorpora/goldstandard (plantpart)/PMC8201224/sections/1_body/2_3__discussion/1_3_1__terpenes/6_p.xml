<p>Differences in terpene profiles were observed among the three tissue sources: terpene profiles of the leaves were characterized by high relative contents of (+)-α-pinene and 1,8-cineole, and high relative contents of (−)-verbenone and β-caryophyllene were also detected in mature and young leaves, respectively. Cortical terpene profiles showed high relative contents of (+)/(−)-α-pinene, camphene, (+)/(−)-β-pinene, camphor and caryophyllene oxide in mature bark, while xylem tissue was characterized by the presence of (+)/(−)-β-pinene as the major compound, reaching up to almost 89%. In other plant species, variations in terpene profiles were reported as those detected between cortical and foliar tissues of Mediterranean pine species of group “
 <italic>halepensis</italic>” (
 <italic>Pinus halepensis</italic> Mill., 
 <italic>Pinus brutia</italic> Ten. and 
 <italic>Pinus eldarica</italic> Medw.). In particular, limonene was present in higher relative content in cortical than foliar tissue of 
 <italic>P. eldarica</italic>, and this monoterpene represented a powerful biochemical marker to distinguish this pine species from 
 <italic>P. halepensis</italic> and 
 <italic>P. brutia</italic> [

 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] also reported differences in essential oil yield and terpene composition among four tissues (leaf, bark, heartwood and sapwood) of the Japanese cedar (
 <italic>Cryptomeria japonica</italic> D. Don). They also proposed that the sesquiterpenes δ-cadinene, isoledene and γ-muurolene might provide resistance to four wood decay fungi and three pathogenic fungi.
