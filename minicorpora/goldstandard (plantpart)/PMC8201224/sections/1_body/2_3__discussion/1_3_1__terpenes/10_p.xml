<p>Young cortical tissue samples had higher relative contents of myrcene, p-cymene, (−)-bornylacetate, (−)-verbenone and α-humulene than the mature ones, with the only exception being (+)/(−)-β-pinene. As already mentioned in the results, only a few terpenes were detected in young tissue of xylem showing higher relative contents of (−)-α-pinene, (+)-α-pinene, (−)-camphene, borneol and β-caryophyllene than mature tissue samples.</p>
