<p>The highest TCT was observed in the leaves, while the lowest levels were observed in the xylem tissue samples. Our results agree with the data of Yosr et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], which revealed a significantly higher yield of essential oils in leaves than stems and flowers. TCT was much higher in young leaves than mature leaves, in agreement with data in the literature showing the highest contents in developing leaves [

 <xref rid="B35-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Terpene biosynthesis per gram of leaves is a high energy-expensive process for the plant, that cannot maintain high levels of these defensive substances in all tissues or organs during the whole life cycle. Therefore, terpenes are preferentially accumulated in young tissues as they are generally more vulnerable to the attack of herbivores [
