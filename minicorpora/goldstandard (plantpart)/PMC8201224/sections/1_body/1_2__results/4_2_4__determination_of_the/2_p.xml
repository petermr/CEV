 <italic>A. alternata</italic>: The MIC for (+)-α-pinene and (−)-verbenone was 0.625%, while it was 0.313% for (−)-β-pinene and 1.25% for rosmarinic acid. Since the growth medium appeared opaque after the addition of rosmarinic acid, for this compound, the MIC was not determined by visual inspection but only by the spectrophotometer absorbance values, as reported in

For the two camphor enantiomers and borneol, the MIC was determined by the agar well-diffusion assay and was 0.625% for both enantiomers and 1.25% for borneol (
