 <italic>P. viridiflava</italic>: The MIC value for (+)-α-pinene, (−)-verbenone and rosmarinic acid was 1.25%. A partial growth reduction of the bacterium was detected by visual inspection for verbenone at the concentration of 0.625% (

For copper sulphate, the use of resazurin allowed to determine a MIC of 0.313%, while it was 0.625% by visual inspection. Methanol inhibited the bacterial growth only at the concentration of 5%, and the next dilutions did not affect the bacterial growth (
