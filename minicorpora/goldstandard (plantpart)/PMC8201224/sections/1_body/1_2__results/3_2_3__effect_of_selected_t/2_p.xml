<p>Only α-pinene enantiomers, (−)-verbenone and rosmarinic acid inhibited the growth of the bacterium 
 <italic>P. viridiflava</italic>, while the remaining seven compounds resulted totally ineffective (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03425-f006">Figure 6</xref>). Verbenone showed the highest antibacterial activity, producing an inhibition halo of 5.6 mm. However, its inhibition activity was significantly lower than copper sulphate.
