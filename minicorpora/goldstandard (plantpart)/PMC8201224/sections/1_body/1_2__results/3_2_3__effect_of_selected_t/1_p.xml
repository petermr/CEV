<p>The growth of the phytopathogenic fungus 
 <italic>A. alternata</italic> was affected by eight out of the ten compounds tested, since β-caryophyllene and (−)-β-pinene were totally ineffective. (+)-camphor was the most effective compound, showing an inhibition activity higher than copper sulphate, while the antifungal activity of (−)-camphor and (−)-verbenone was instead comparable to that of the fungicide. (+)/(−)-borneol also determined a strong inhibition of the fungal growth (

 <italic>A. alternata.</italic> The fungus produced a diffusible dark-brown pigment in response to the presence of rosmarinic acid in the medium, as shown in
