<p>The young xylem tissue (XY) samples showed a limited number of terpenes, including (+)/(−)-β-pinene (over 75%), (+)-α-pinene (7.6%) and (−)-camphene (4.4%), and minor constituents such as (−)-α-pinene (2.5%), borneol (1.3%) and β-caryophyllene (0.9%). In XM tissue, in addition to (+)/(−)-β-pinene (close to 90%), only two other monoterpenes, (+)-α-pinene (1.6%) and (−)-α-pinene (0.4%), were detected.</p>
