<p>The relative contents of all the volatile terpenes showed significant differences among different tissue sources. In particular, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03425-f003">Figure 3</xref>, (+)-α-pinene was the most abundant compound in all leaf samples (LY: 25.0%; LMu: 26.3%; LMb: 26.54%) and in the cortex (BY: 27.4%; BM: 28.3%), while (+)/(−)-β-pinene showed the highest relative contents in xylem tissues (XY: 75.7%; XM: 88.8%). In mature leaves, the relative contents of (+)-β-pinene in LMu (3.6%) and LMb (2.7%) were significantly higher than (−)-β-pinene (LMu 0.4%; LMb 0.7%). On the contrary, the percentage of (−)-β-pinene in young leaves (LY) was significantly higher (6.0%) than (+)-β-pinene (1.6%) (data not shown). Other abundant constituents of leaves were (−)-verbenone (LMu: 12.27%; LMb: 13.1%), 1,8-cineole (LY: 8.6%; LMu: 10.0%; LMb: 8.7%) and β-caryophyllene (LY: 7.9%). Differently, (−)-camphene (BY: 18.1%; BM: 16.8%), (+)/(−)-β-pinene (BM, 18.2%) and (−)-α-pinene (BY, 9.5%) were the major compounds in cortical tissue samples.
