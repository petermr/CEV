<p>From our findings, it emerged that the different ages significantly modified the terpene composition of the foliar tissue (

The highest contents of (+)/(−)-β-pinene, (−)-bornylacetate, β-caryophyllene and α-humulene were detected in young leaf (LY) samples, also characterized by significantly lower percentages of sabinene, myrcene, (−)-limonene, (+)-limonene, (−)-linalool and (−)-verbenone than mature leaves. On the contrary, mature leaves (LMu and LMb) were significantly richer in (−)-verbenone (
