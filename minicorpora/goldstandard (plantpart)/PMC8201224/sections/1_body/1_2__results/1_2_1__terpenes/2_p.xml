<p>The enantiomers (+)-camphene and (+)-linalool were detected in trace amounts in a few samples and, therefore, were not considered in the elaboration of data. The two forms of Î²-pinene were distinguished only in a few samples of foliar tissue, where they occurred in considerable amounts. Some difficulties were encountered to obtain a complete chiral chromatographic separation of cortical and xylem tissue samples, mainly because only trace amounts of each single enantiomer were detected.</p>
