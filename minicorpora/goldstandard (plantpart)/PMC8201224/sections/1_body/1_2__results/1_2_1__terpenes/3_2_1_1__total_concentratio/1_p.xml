<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03425-f002">Figure 2</xref>, significant variations in TCT were detected among samples collected from different plant tissues and of different ages (N = 63, 
 <italic>Ï‡</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 54.8, df = 6, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The greatest amounts of TCT occurred in young leaves (LY), mature leaves of the upper part of the branch (LMu) and mature leaves of the base of the branch (LMb), while the lowest were observed in the xylem tissue samples (XY, young xylem tissue; XM, mature xylem tissue). Regarding tissue age, TCT was up to three times higher in young leaves (LY) than in mature leaves (LMu and LMb samples).
