<p>The content of phenolic compounds was investigated in the foliar, cortical and xylem tissues of rosemary. The HPLC profile of the extracts from cortical and xylem tissues showed a lack of those phenolic compounds typically present in rosemary leaves (e.g., rosmarinic acid, carnosic acid, carnosol, etc.), while only negligible amounts of caffeic acid derivatives and flavonoids were detected. Consequently,
