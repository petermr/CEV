<p>The main phenols of this plant, rosmarinic acid and carnosic acid and its derivatives, did not show significant differences between the leaf tissues of the two different ages. As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03425-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the Mann–Whitney U-Test showed significant differences (N = 18, df = 1) between LY and LMu samples in the content of four flavonoids: isoorientin (
