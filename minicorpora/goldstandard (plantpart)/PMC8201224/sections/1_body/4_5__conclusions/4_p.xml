<p>Microbial test results showed that several terpenes and rosmarinic acid inhibited the growth of two polyphagous pathogens of rosemary, the fungus 
 <italic>A. alternata</italic> and the bacterium 
 <italic>P. viridiflava</italic>. Knowledge of chemical composition variations due to source and age of tissues is important for a more targeted harvesting of the rosemary plant, which can help to produce higher-quality essential oils and richer phenolic extracts for agro-food, pharmaceutical and cosmetics applications. In addition, results on antimicrobial activity of selected terpenes and rosmarinic acid suggest the use of these natural compounds as biochemical markers in breeding programs for the selection of less susceptible rosemary chemotypes, and to produce eco-friendly chemical alternatives to synthetic pesticides for improving human and environmental health.
