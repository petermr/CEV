 <p>This study investigated within-plant variability of the main bioactive compounds in rosemary (
  <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L.). Volatile terpenes, including the enantiomeric distribution of monoterpenes, and phenols were analyzed in young and mature foliar, cortical and xylem tissues. In addition, antimicrobial activity of rosmarinic acid and selected terpenes was evaluated against two rosemary pathogens, 
  <italic>Alternaria alternata</italic> and 
  <italic>Pseudomonas viridiflava</italic>. Data showed that total concentration and relative contents of terpenes changed in relation to tissue source and age. Their highest total concentration was observed in the young leaves, followed by mature leaves, cortical and xylem tissues. Rosmarinic acid and carnosic acid contents did not show significant differences between leaf tissues of different ages, while young and mature samples showed variations in the content of four flavonoids. These results are useful for a more targeted harvesting of rosemary plants, in order to produce high-quality essential oils and phenolic extracts. Microbial tests showed that several terpenes and rosmarinic acid significantly inhibited the growth of typical rosemary pathogens. Overall, results on antimicrobial activity suggest the potential application of these natural compounds as biochemical markers in breeding programs aimed to select new chemotypes less susceptible to pathogen attacks, and as eco-friendly chemical alternatives to synthetic pesticides.
