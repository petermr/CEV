  <p>Table S1: List of terpenes and the main phenolic compounds identified in rosemary extracts. Rt, retention times; MW, molecular weight. Table S2: Statistical results of the Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA test examining variations in the relative content of terpenes in relation to source and age of the tissue: N = 63; degrees of freedom = 6;

Samples collected from the upper part of the branch are indicated with “u” and at the base of the branch with “b”. Table S3: Determination of MIC of (+)-α-pinene, (−)-β-pinene, (−)-verbenone, rosmarinic acid and copper sulphate against 
   <italic>A. alternata</italic> by the microdilution method. Data represent the spectrophotometer absorbance values measured at 450 nm. Values in bold indicate the MIC values. Control value is 0.188 (average value of eight measurements) and is represented by 
   <italic>A. alternata</italic> grown without antimicrobials. At concentration of 0.313% of rosmarinic acid, 
   <italic>A. alternata</italic> releases a dark pigment in the growth medium. Figure S1: Response of the fungus 
   <italic>A. alternaria</italic> to rosmarinic acid. Left: plate with wells containing SDW; right: plate with wells containing rosmarinic acid. Figure S2: Response of the bacterium 
   <italic>P. viridiflava</italic> to rosmarinic acid. Left: plate with wells containing SDW, the bacterium covers the agar surface as a pale-yellow thin layer. Right: plate with wells containing rosmarinic acid, the pale-yellow layer is hidden by the dark pigment, and around the wells, no bacterial growth was observed. Figure S3: Determination of MIC for (+)-α-pinene (columns 1–3), (−)-verbenone (columns 4–6) and rosmarinic acid (columns 7–9) against 
   <italic>P. viridiflava</italic>. After 24 h of incubation, 30 µL of a resazurin solution was added to each well. The blue color indicates no bacteria multiplication (column 12, negative control), while the pink/red color indicates that the bacterial growth was not inhibited (column 10, positive control). Column 11 represents the control for methanol since all dilutions of the different compounds were made in this solvent.
