Introduction</title><p>The Mediterranean basin is endowed with a wealth of aromatic plants, including rosemary (<italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L.), an evergreen shrub whose health benefits have been recognized since ancient times. There is a rising awareness of consumers toward health foods for disease prevention, and rosemary is considered one of the most interesting sources of phytochemicals that could provide health benefits [<xref rid="B1-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This aromatic plant is added directly to food as fresh leaves or in the form of concentrated extracts. Two groups of molecules are mainly responsible for the biological activities and beneficial health properties of the rosemary plant: the volatile terpenes as main constituents of essential oils, and the phenolic compounds [<xref rid="B2-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Essential oil, as well as phenolic extracts of rosemary, are recognized as safe by the FDA [<xref rid="B3-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and EFSA [<xref rid="B4-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Essential oils are a complex mixture of volatile and semi-volatile compounds, including monoterpenes, that can represent up to 90% of the oil, and sesquiterpenes as the main components [<xref rid="B5-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Other minor constituents are esters, ketones, small phenols and alcohols [<xref rid="B6-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A number of studies report antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of <italic>R. officinalis</italic> essential oil [<xref rid="B8-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Furthermore, the strong influence of terpenes on the sensorial quality and shelf-life of several foods has been widely recognized [<xref rid="B2-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Rosemary is used not only to obtain essential oils but also to produce phenolic leaf extracts containing a pool of compounds responsible for several biological properties, as demonstrated by in vitro experiments and in vivo animal tests [<xref rid="B11-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Three main groups of phenolic compounds characterize these extracts: rosmarinic acid, a group of minor flavonoids and phenolic diterpenes such as carnosic acid and carnosol. The main bioactivities related to these phenolic compounds are anti-inflammatory [<xref rid="B12-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], chemo-preventive [<xref rid="B14-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and anti-proliferative [<xref rid="B16-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Recently, protective effects towards neurological disorders have been noted for rosmarinic and carnosic acids [<xref rid="B17-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], as well as an ability to decrease the risks related to obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome [<xref rid="B18-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Jordan et al. [<xref rid="B20-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] explained that the highest antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of rosemary essential oils and phenolic extracts collected at the fruit maturation phase, compared to full bloom, were due to variations in the contents of several terpenes and phenols. In general, variations occurring in rosemary terpene and phenol phenotypes are the product of the interaction of the genes with the environment and are also due to plant ontogeny and phenology [<xref rid="B21-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Although changes in constitutive or induced plant secondary metabolites are known to play a major role in innumerable defensive functions against insects, herbivores and plant pathogens, the number and structural diversity of these defensive chemicals provide a myriad of significant ecological roles [<xref rid="B23-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Chemo-systematic studies showed that the total absolute amounts of monoterpenes of essential oils and resins can be influenced by abiotic factors, while the relative percentages of constitutive monoterpenes in mature tissues are under strong genetic control and scarcely affected by abiotic stresses [<xref rid="B23-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B25-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Therefore, monoterpenes have often been used as biochemical markers to characterize plant species, hybrids, provenances, families and clones [<xref rid="B26-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>These variations in chemical composition of essential oils and phenols are important to characterize superior chemotypes for potential industrial applications in food, pharmaceutical, perfumery and cosmetic fields.</p><p>Although monoterpenes are widely studied as the main constituents of essential oils, based on our knowledge, there are very few studies on enantiomeric monoterpenes of rosemary. Particularly, two and four works on chiral monoterpenes respectively in foliar tissues [<xref rid="B27-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and in essential oils obtained from leaves or aerial parts of the plant [<xref rid="B29-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] were reported in the literature. It should be pointed out that this is the first study showing enantiomeric variations of rosemary monoterpenes in different tissues of different age, and these variations are known to play different ecological roles and induce different sensorial perceptions [<xref rid="B24-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>The aims of this study were to investigate on the changes in content of bioactive compounds of rosemary plant and to evaluate their activity against some typical rosemary pathogens. Specific objectives were: (i) to determine variation in total concentrations and relative contents of terpenes and phenols among different types of tissue (foliar, cortical and xylem), (ii) to investigate the effects of tissue age on the content of terpenes and phenols, (iii) to determine enantiomeric terpene distribution within-plant and (iv) to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of selected terpenic compounds (including some chiral monoterpenes) and rosmarinic acid, against the fungus <italic>Alternaria alternata</italic> and the bacterium <italic>Pseudomonas viridiflava</italic>. These pathogens are known to induce heavy damages on aerial parts of the rosemary plants, causing important economic losses in nursery [<xref rid="B33-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. A better knowledge on terpenes and phenolic content in the different tissues can be useful for a more targeted harvesting of rosemary plants, in order to produce high-quality essential oils and phenolic extracts. At the same time, knowledge of antimicrobial properties of rosemary tissue components can be usefully applied for breeding programs aimed to select less susceptible chemotypes to pest and diseases and to produce eco-friendly formulates, alternatives to synthetic pesticides, less harmful to human and environmental health.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-molecules-26-03425"><title>2.

Terpenes</title><p>In general, our data showed that TCT and relative contents of terpenes changed in relation to different tissue sources and tissue ages.</p><p>The highest TCT was observed in the leaves, while the lowest levels were observed in the xylem tissue samples. Our results agree with the data of Yosr et al. [<xref rid="B21-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], which revealed a significantly higher yield of essential oils in leaves than stems and flowers. TCT was much higher in young leaves than mature leaves, in agreement with data in the literature showing the highest contents in developing leaves [<xref rid="B23-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B35-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Terpene biosynthesis per gram of leaves is a high energy-expensive process for the plant, that cannot maintain high levels of these defensive substances in all tissues or organs during the whole life cycle. Therefore, terpenes are preferentially accumulated in young tissues as they are generally more vulnerable to the attack of herbivores [<xref rid="B23-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>It is worth noting that rosemary essential oil production is usually obtained via steam distillation of small branches with young and mature leaves of the current season&#x02019;s growth. Our data showed that leaf tissues represented over half (about 66%) of the total biomass of branches, followed by xylem tissues (about 24%) and cortical tissues (about 10%). Therefore, leaves representing the major source of biomass with the highest TCT are the organs that contribute to a greater extent to the chemical profile of essential oil and its final quality.</p><p>No differences in relative terpene contents were detected between mature leaves collected from two different parts of the branch. These results are in agreement with previous data reporting that relative contents of constitutive monoterpenes in mature tissues remain stable and can be used as biochemical markers in chemotaxonomic studies [<xref rid="B21-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B36-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>On the contrary, differences in the relative terpene contents were found between samples of different tissue sources and different tissue age.

They also proposed that the sesquiterpenes &#x003b4;-cadinene, isoledene and &#x003b3;-muurolene might provide resistance to four wood decay fungi and three pathogenic fungi.</p><p>From our findings, it emerged that the age significantly modified the terpene composition of the different tissue sources.</p><p>Few reports regarding studies on the variations in terpene profiles between young and mature tissues are available, and most of these works are related to leaf tissue. In this study, it was shown that the highest contents of (+)/(&#x02212;)-&#x003b2;-pinene, (&#x02212;)-bornylacetate, &#x003b2;-caryophyllene and &#x003b1;-humulene were detected in young leaf samples, while mature leaves showed high relative content of (&#x02212;)-verbenone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03425-f003">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Some of the changes in terpene contents related to the leaf age are consistent with the function of these molecules to protect the plant against the attack of pests and diseases, in fact, it has been hypothesized that changes were determined by herbivore selection pressures [<xref rid="B23-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Young cortical tissue samples had higher relative contents of myrcene, p-cymene, (&#x02212;)-bornylacetate, (&#x02212;)-verbenone and &#x003b1;-humulene than the mature ones, with the only exception being (+)/(&#x02212;)-&#x003b2;-pinene.

It must be pointed out that until now, no information on enantiomeric distribution has been available for cortex and xylem tissues of rosemary. This current study shows that (+)-&#x003b1;-pinene was the predominant enantiomer, in agreement with data in the literature [<xref rid="B27-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B31-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. For the other monoterpenes, the enantiomeric distribution detected in our samples were partially in agreement with data in the literature. (&#x02212;)-camphene and (&#x02212;)-linalool were the predominant enantiomers, in agreement with data on fresh leaf samples reported by Larkov et al.

Antimicrobial Activity against A. alternata and P. viridiflava</title><p>Antimicrobial activity of rosemary essential oil and its components has been widely investigated against several pathogens of clinical origin, spreading mainly as food contaminants and responsible for dangerous diseases to humans, and some plant pathogens [<xref rid="B41-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. To our knowledge, however, the antimicrobial activity of rosemary essential oil compounds has not yet been evaluated against the fungus <italic>A. alternata</italic> and the bacterium <italic>P. viridiflava</italic>, two polyphagous plant pathogens able to infect rosemary plants [<xref rid="B33-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The two species were tested for their sensitivity to rosmarinic acid and to the terpenic compounds identified in this study as the main components of rosemary essential oil. Except for &#x003b2;-caryophyllene and (&#x02212;)-&#x003b2;-pinene, the remaining seven compounds showed a significative antifungal activity, that in the case of camphor and (&#x02212;)-verbenone, inhibited the growth of <italic>A. alternata</italic> at the same rate as copper sulphate, a compound commonly used as a pesticide to control bacterial and fungal pathogens and allowed in organic farming [<xref rid="B44-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. On the other hand, the bacterium <italic>P. viridiflava</italic> was inhibited only by the two &#x003b1;-pinene enantiomers, (&#x02212;)-verbenone and rosmarinic acid. However, their efficacy was significantly lower than copper sulphate. It is known that Gram-negative bacteria (including <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species) show low sensitivity to the antimicrobial activity of terpenic compounds, since their outer membrane contains hydrophilic polysaccharides (LPS) which create a barrier towards macromolecules and hydrophobic compounds [<xref rid="B45-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This could explain the negative response of <italic>P. viridiflava</italic> to most of the terpenes assayed in this study. Rosmarinic acid, that is a naturally occurring phenolic compound in a number of plants belonging to the <italic>Lamiaceae</italic> family, showed a certain effectiveness against both the plant pathogens tested in this study, in which it induced the production of a dark-brown diffusible pigment. Indeed, some microbial species are able to produce the dark pigment melanin through the activation of the enzyme laccase that catalyzes the oxidative polymerization of phenolic compounds. The activation of melanin synthesis is known as a cell survival mechanism for several micro-organisms [<xref rid="B46-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Most probably, the dark-brown pigment secreted in the growth medium by <italic>A. alternata</italic> and <italic>P. viridiflava</italic> is a melanin-like compound produced by the two pathogens as a defense mechanism against rosmarinic acid. In fact, both pathogens were inhibited in the growth but not devitalized by rosmarinic acid. Since polyphenols are produced in plants to prevent microbial infections, it is conceivable that during host&#x02013;pathogen co-evolution, a resistance mechanism (laccase synthesis) was transferred from the plant to the pathogen. This hypothesis is supported by phylogenetic studies that have evidenced that the fungal laccases are closely related to plant laccases [<xref rid="B46-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>Results obtained from the antimicrobial tests performed in this study highlight new possible strategies to control the two rosemary pathogens in the nursery: rosemary varieties at high content of (&#x02212;)-verbenone and &#x003b1;-pinene should be less sensitive to the attack of the two pathogenic species considered in this study, then a selection on the basis of terpene profile could help to screen among the available commercial rosemary genotypes for resistance to pathogens. Copper-based formulates are widely used in conventional as well as in organic farming. However, repeated and excessive use of copper can lead to accumulation in soil, where it is toxic to many macro- and micro-organisms, while the accumulation in the food web may determine toxicity to humans [<xref rid="B44-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Then, the use of copper in agriculture is quite controversial and the development of alternative formulates is strongly needed. Results regarding the antimicrobial activity of terpenic compounds obtained in this study are very promising, however further studies are needed for the development of terpene-based formulates. The development of new verbenone/&#x003b1;-pinene-based formulates may represent an alternative way to use the available chemical pesticides for controlling rosemary pathogens and most probably also other bacterial and fungal plant pathogens. The inclusion of terpenes in a solid matrix should extend the release time and enhance the water solubility of these highly volatile hydrophobic compounds [<xref rid="B47-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4-molecules-26-03425"><title>4.

The bacterium <italic>P. viridiflava</italic> was grown on Nutrient Agar (Oxoid Ltd., UK) amended with 2.5 g/L of glucose (NGA) for 48 h at 27 &#x000b0;C. PDA and NGA media were also used to test the inhibition activity against the two pathogens of the main terpenic and phenolic compounds of rosemary leaf identified in this study. The selected compounds were: (+)-borneol, (&#x02212;)-borneol, (+)-camphor, (&#x02212;)-camphor, &#x003b2;-caryophillene, (+)-&#x003b1;-pinene, (&#x02212;)-&#x003b1;-pinene, (+)-&#x003b2;-pinene, (&#x02212;)-&#x003b2;-pinene, (&#x02212;)-verbenone and rosmarinic acid. Copper sulphate was used as a positive control for both pathogens. The agar well-diffusion method was used to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the different compounds [<xref rid="B50-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><sec id="sec4dot6dot1-molecules-26-03425"><title>4.6.1. Antimicrobial Activity against <italic>A. alternata</italic></title><p>PDA was prepared according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions, autoclaved at 121 &#x000b0;C for 15 min and poured into Petri dishes. After the medium solidification, two wells of 0.5 cm diameter were cut at the opposite side of the agar plates using a cork borer and 20 &#x000b5;L of the liquid or 20 &#x000b5;g of the solid compounds were placed into the wells. Twenty &#x000b5;L of sterile distilled water (SDW) was placed into the wells of control plates. Then, a 0.5 cm disk cut from the edge of the <italic>A. alternata</italic> colony was placed in the middle of each Petri dish. Three plates for each treatment were prepared. Plates were sealed with three layers of parafilm, incubated at 25 &#x000b0;C and monitored for two weeks. To evaluate the inhibition activity of the tested compounds against <italic>A. alternata</italic>, two diameters were measured for each fungal colony and data were compared to the diameter size of the control (SDW).</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot6dot2-molecules-26-03425"><title>4.6.2. Antimicrobial Activity against <italic>P. viridiflava</italic></title><p>The 48 h-old culture of <italic>P. viridiflava</italic> was used to prepare a bacterial suspension in saline solution (0.8% NaCl). The bacterial concentration of the suspension was measured by a spectrophotometer and adjusted to an optical density of 0.1 at 530 nm, corresponding to 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> cfu/mL, and 1.5 mL of the suspension was mixed with 15 mL of NGA medium poured into the Petri dishes. After the medium solidification, two wells of 0.5 cm diameter were cut at the opposite side of the agar plates using a cork borer, and then 20 &#x000b5;L of the liquid or 20 &#x000b5;g of the solid compounds were placed into the wells. Plates with 20 &#x000b5;L of SDW in the wells were used as controls of bacterial growth. Three plates for each treatment were prepared. Plates were sealed with three layers of parafilm and then incubated at 27 &#x000b0;C for 48 h. The antibacterial activity of the tested compounds was evaluated measuring the size of the growth inhibition halo surrounding the wells.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot6dot3-molecules-26-03425"><title>4.6.3. Determination of the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC)</title><p><italic>A. alternata</italic>: The 96-well microplate dilution method reported by Hassan and Cutter [<xref rid="B51-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] was used for (+)-&#x003b1;-pinene, (&#x02212;)-&#x003b2;-pinene, verbenone, rosmarinic acid and copper sulphate, while for borneol, and the two camphor enantiomers that were not soluble in the liquid growth medium, the protocol described above (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4dot6dot1-molecules-26-03425">Section 4.6.1</xref>) was used to determine the MIC. For the microdilution method, the fungus was grown on PDA plates for one week, then conidia were collected by scraping the agar surface and suspended in potato dextrose broth (PDB). Conidia were enumerated by a hemocytometer and concentration was adjusted to 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> conidia/mL. The antimicrobial compounds were dissolved in methanol to obtain a 10% solution. This solution was serially diluted 1:1 in PDB until the concentration of 0.039% [<xref rid="B51-molecules-26-03425" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. One hundred &#x000b5;L of each dilution were placed in the microplate wells, then 100 &#x000b5;L of the conidial suspension was added to each well. Each dilution was tested in triplicate. The positive control was represented by 100 &#x000b5;L of the conidial suspension plus 100 &#x000b5;L of PDB, while the negative control consisted of 200 &#x000b5;L of sterile PDB. A control to test methanol inhibition activity was also carried out. Plates were incubated at 25 &#x000b0;C for 48 h and fungal growth was determined both by visual reading and by a spectrophotometer at 450 nm. The MIC value for the two camphor enantiomers and borneol was considered as the highest dilution of each compound that determines a significant reduction of the growth of <italic>A. alternaria</italic> colony with respect to the control (SDW).</p><p><italic>P. viridiflava</italic>: The 96-well microplate dilution method was used for all compounds. The bacterium was grown for 48 h in plates containing NGA medium, then the bacterial suspension was prepared in nutrient broth amended with 0.25% glucose (NGB) following the procedure described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4dot6dot2-molecules-26-03425">Section 4.6.2</xref>. On the basis of the results obtained from the test of in vitro antimicrobial activity, only the compounds that were active against <italic>P. viridiflava</italic> (i.e., (+)-&#x003b1;-pinene, verbenone and rosmarinic acid) were assayed for the MIC determination. Only the enantiomer (+)-&#x003b1;-pinene was tested, since inhibition activity had resulted not different for the two forms of this compound. The dilutions of the different compounds and next steps of the procedure were the same of that previously reported for <italic>A. alternata</italic>, using NGB as a growth medium. The positive control was represented by 100 &#x000b5;L of the bacterial suspension plus 100 &#x000b5;L of NGB, while the negative control consisted of 200 &#x000b5;L of sterile NGB. A control to test methanol inhibition activity was also carried out. Plates were incubated at 27 &#x000b0;C for 24 h, then the bacterial growth was first recorded by a visual reading of the plates. Then, 30 &#x000b5;L of a resazurin solution (0.015%) was added to each well and plates were incubated for 3 h at 27 &#x000b0;C. The color of the suspensions contained in each well was recorded.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4dot7-molecules-26-03425"><title>4.7. Statistical Analyses</title><p>Data did not meet the normality assumption of ANOVA even after transformation (Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov one-sample test), and therefore were analyzed by the non-parametric Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis ANOVA followed by the Mann&#x02013;Whitney U-test for multiple comparisons using SYSTAT 12.0 software (Systat Software Inc., Richmond, CA, USA). Differences were accepted when significant at the 5% level.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-molecules-26-03425"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Our results showed significant changes in total concentrations and relative contents of terpenes and their enantiomeric distribution within both different tissue sources and tissue ages.</p><p>The highest concentration was detected in young leaves, while the lowest absolute amount in xylem tissue samples. The young cortex contained appreciable contents that can affect the oil composition and increase yield.</p><p>Among the phenolic compounds, the contents of only four minor flavonoids showed variations in foliar tissue samples collected at different ages.</p><p>Microbial test results showed that several terpenes and rosmarinic acid inhibited the growth of two polyphagous pathogens of rosemary, the fungus <italic>A. alternata</italic> and the bacterium <italic>P. viridiflava</italic>. Knowledge of chemical composition variations due to source and age of tissues is important for a more targeted harvesting of the rosemary plant, which can help to produce higher-quality essential oils and richer phenolic extracts for agro-food, pharmaceutical and cosmetics applications. In addition, results on antimicrobial activity of selected terpenes and rosmarinic acid suggest the use of these natural compounds as biochemical markers in breeding programs for the selection of less susceptible rosemary chemotypes, and to produce eco-friendly chemical alternatives to synthetic pesticides for improving human and environmental health.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was partially supported by a contribution from ARSIA&#x02014;Tuscany, within the project OLIROTO.
