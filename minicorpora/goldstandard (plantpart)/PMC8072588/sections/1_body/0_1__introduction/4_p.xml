<p>In Algeria, the 
 <italic>Thymus algerian</italic> Boiss. Reut. (Synonym Thymus hirtus Willd. Subsp. algeriensis Boiss. Et Reut.) plant, which known is as “Himria” in the Algerian vernacular language, is classified by the local inhabitants especially in rural communities as an important and indispensable element in healing some common age diseases such as stomach or gastrointestinal diseases and physiotherapy [

 <xref rid="B17-plants-10-00786" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the present study, we tried to determine the chemical composition of 
 <italic>Thymus algeriensis</italic> Boiss., essential oil, harvested in three different growing stages: before, during, and after the flowering plant period, targeting different parts from the plant (stems, flowers, and leaves), and using three distinguished extraction techniques, hydrodistillation (HD), steam distillation (SD), and microwave-assisted distillation (MAD) in order to maximize the extraction yield and see the differences in the resulted EOs chemical components. On the other half, some important 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> biological tests were performed on the recovered EOs, including the following:
