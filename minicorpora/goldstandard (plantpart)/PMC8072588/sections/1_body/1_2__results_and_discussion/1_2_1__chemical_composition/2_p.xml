<p>It could be noticed from 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00786-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> that camphor, borneol, camphene, 1,8-cineol, and bornyl acetate were the major constituents, in addition to a much lower concentration of α pinene, limonene, cis-sabinene hydrate, terpinene-4-ol, isobornyl formate, β-bourbonene, alloaromadendrene, bicyclogermacrene, eudesmol, and cedranol. The oil from Thymus algeriensis has been proven to be rich in monoterpene hydrocarbons (≈14.32% to 26.90%), oxygenated monoterpenes (≈40.56% to 70.66%), sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (1.01% to 5.07%), and oxygenated sesquiterpene (2.84% to 17.04%).
