<p>The evaluation of the EOs toxicity of human cancer cells was done by the mitochondrial-dependent reduction of yellow (which is the part responsible for the production of energy within the living cell). In this study, two cancer cell lines were examined: colon cancer HCT116 (ATCC
 <sup>®</sup> CCL­247™) and Hepatic cancer HePG2 (ATCC
 <sup>®</sup> HB-8065™). In this experiment, all investigations were performed at the logarithmic growth phase of the cells, where the cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 media (L-glutamine augmented with 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 U/mL streptomycin, and 25 µg/mL amphotericin B). Cells were grown and developed at the temperature of 37 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> humidified atmosphere The determined cytotoxicity was done in triplicate by using the 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) cell viability assay; 2 × 104 cells/well of exponentially growing cells of both HePG2 and HCT116 cell lines were seeded in a 96-well plate [

Doxorubicin (a type of drug in chemotherapy that slows or stops the growth of cancer cells) was used in this test as a positive control.
