<p>As part of the descriptive statistics, the generalized (relative, absolute) coefficients of variation were calculated for each CV variable (coefficient of variation in percentage) or the relative standard deviation. They are a measure of the random variability of the experiments performed. The explanations for all tables contain the most important elements of the analysis of variance, including the calculated probabilities (the so-called 
 <italic>p</italic> value) related to the F (Fisherâ€“Snedecor) test functions used. The calculated 
 <italic>p</italic>-values determine the significance and size of the influence of the studied factors on the differentiation of the results of the analyzed variables, comparing them with the most commonly accepted alpha significance levels (0.05). In the case of cytostaticity, statistical significance was tested between the samples and the negative control (vehicle cells) using the independent t-test samples in the SPSS 11 program. Likewise, a probability analysis of the determination of LC50 and LC90 was performed using the SPSS 11 program [
