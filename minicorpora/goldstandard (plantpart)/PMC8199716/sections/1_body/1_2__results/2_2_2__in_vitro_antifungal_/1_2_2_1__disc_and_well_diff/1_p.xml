<p>The disc and well diffusion test results for 
 <italic>B. cinerea</italic> and 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp. are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03367-f001">Figure 1</xref>. For the test fungi, the diameter of the ZI were relatively wider when observed using agar well diffusion test than the disc diffusion test. In addition, disc diffusion test showed LO and TO as the most effective EOs for both fungi; whereas, OO showed no inhibition effect. However, for the same EOs, the agar well diffusion test showed some differences compared to the disc diffusion test. For 
 <italic>B. cinerea</italic>, using the disc diffusion test (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03367-f001">Figure 1</xref>a), LO had the widest ZI (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), at an average of 25.33 mm (1 µL/mL), followed by TO (11.33 mm; 0.3 µL/mL) and others. Similarly, from well diffusion test (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03367-f001">Figure 1</xref>c), LO had the widest ZI (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) of 23.00 mm (1 µL/mL), followed by PPE (10 mm; 1 µL/mL), OO (6.67 µL/mL; 0.5 µL/mL), TO (3 mm; 0.5 µL/mL) and others. Likewise, for 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp. using the disc diffusion test (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03367-f001">Figure 1</xref>b), LO had the widest ZI (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) of 15.67 mm (1 µL/mL) followed by TO (10.00 mm; 1 µL/mL) and others. Using well diffusion test (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03367-f001">Figure 1</xref>d), LO recorded the widest ZI of 31.33 mm (1 µL/mL), and followed by TO (6.33 mm; 1 µL/mL), OO (4.66 mm; 0.5 µL/mL) and others.
