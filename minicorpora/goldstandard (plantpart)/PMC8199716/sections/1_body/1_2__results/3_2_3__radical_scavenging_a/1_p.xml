<p>Using DPPH method (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03367-f003">Figure 3</xref>a) at different concentrations (0.1–1 mg/mL) of EOs and PEs, radical scavenging activity (RSA) was in the range 1.64–69.95%. There was an increase in RSA as the concentration of EOs and PEs was increased, with PPE and GPE recording the highest (69.95%) and lowest (22.07%) RSA at 1 mg/mL, respectively. For ABTS method (
