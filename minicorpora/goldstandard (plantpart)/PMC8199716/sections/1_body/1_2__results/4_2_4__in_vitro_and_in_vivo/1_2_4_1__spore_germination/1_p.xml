<p>The results for spore germination are shown in

 <sub>MIC,</sub> and CH
 <sub>2MIC</sub> resulted in no spore germination compared to AG and CH (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03367-f004">Figure 4</xref>a). Sodium alginate coating without LO showed lower spore germination than CH and, therefore, AG exerted a greater inhibition in spore germination than CH. Similarly, for 
 <italic>Penicillum</italic> spp., coating treatments AG
 <sub>MIC</sub>, AG
 <sub>2MIC</sub>, CH
 <sub>MIC</sub> and CH
 <sub>2MIC</sub> showed the greatest antimicrobial activity, with no spore germination recorded (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03367-f004">Figure 4</xref>b). Likewise, AG coating inhibited spore germination more compared to CH.
