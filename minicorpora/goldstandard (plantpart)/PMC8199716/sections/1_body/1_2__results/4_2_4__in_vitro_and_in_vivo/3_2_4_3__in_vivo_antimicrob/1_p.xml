<p>Based on the in vitro results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03367-f002">Figure 2</xref>) for LO, the MIC against 
 <italic>B. Cinerea</italic> was 15 µL/mL (1.5% 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) and 30 µL/mL (3% 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) against 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp. These concentrations were selected for the formulation of CH and AG coatings for in vivo experiments. The results of the in vivo study of antimicrobial properties of coatings formulated from LO are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03367-f006">Figure 6</xref>. Moreover, 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03367-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows images of coated ‘Wonderful’ pomegranates inoculated with both 
 <italic>B. cinerea</italic> and 
 <italic>Penicillum</italic> spp. after 10 days of storage. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03367-f006">Figure 6</xref>, application of coating solutions reduced the decay severity caused by test microbes (
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>cinerea</italic> and 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> sp.). For 
 <italic>B. cinerea</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03367-f006">Figure 6</xref>a), incorporation of either MIC (15 µL/mL) or 2MIC (30 µL/mL) of LO into coating solutions (CH and AG) resulted in less decay severity than uncoated fruit, particularly in the first trial (Trial 1). There were no significant differences in decay severity for fruit coated with both CH and AG coatings formulated with either 15 or 30 µL/mL of LO (Trial 1 and 2). For 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp. (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03367-f006">Figure 6</xref>b), in trial 1 and 2, the incorporation of LO at a concentration of either MIC (30 µL/mL) or 2MIC (60 µL/mL) into AG and CH coatings resulted in lower decay severity compared to untreated fruit. In trial 2, for CH coatings, the difference between fruit with/without LO was not significant.
