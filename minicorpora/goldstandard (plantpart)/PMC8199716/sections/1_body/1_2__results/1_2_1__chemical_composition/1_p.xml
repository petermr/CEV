<p>The chemical composition of the lemongrass (LO), thyme (TO), and oregano (OO) are presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03367-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Based on GC–MS analysis, 57 volatile compounds (VOCs) belonging to nine different chemical classes were identified. For LO, the most abundant VOs were monoterpenoids (88.97%), followed by alcohols (8.02%), sesquiterpenes (1.5%), ketones (0.56%) and aldehydes (0.14%). The major compounds identified for LO were α-citral (27.45%), β-citral (27.43%), and limonene (16.59%). Thyme oil consisted of monoterpenes (91.67%), sesquiterpenes (0.09%), alcohols (4.88%), aldehydes (0.44%), and phenylpropene (2.05%). The major compounds identified for TO were thymol (33.31%) and para cymene (43.26%). Oregano oil had VOCs including sesquiterpenes (65.59%), monoterpene (29.26%), sesquiterpenoids (0.55%), monoterpenoids (4.85%), ketones (0.1%), and phenylpropene (0.1%). The compound trans-caryophyllene (60.84%) and 1,8-cineole (17.53%) contributed the largest percentage of the chemical composition of OO.
