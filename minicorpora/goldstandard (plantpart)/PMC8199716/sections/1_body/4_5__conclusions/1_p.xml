<p>The development of biodegradable edible coatings with antimicrobials as a control strategy for the decay and extension of shelf life of pomegranate fruit is increasingly becoming a research priority. Essential oils from lemongrass, thyme and oregano, and extracts from pomegranate peel and grape pomace exhibit promising antimicrobial effects against disease causing pathogens. The present research provides evidence of the efficacy of sodium alginate and chitosan-based bioactive coatings formulated with lemongrass oil to minimize the decay severity and as a possible postharvest control strategy. Lemongrass oil showed good antifungal effects against two major decay pathogens, 
 <italic>B. cinerea</italic> and 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp., and when combined with either sodium alginate or chitosan on artificially inoculated pomegranates. Considering the overall results obtained, lemongrass (30 ÂµL/mL) is recommended as an antimicrobial agent for formulating the bioactive coatings for pomegranate fruit. However, further studies to investigate the effect of lemongrass oil in different edible coatings (polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids) on fruit during cold storage and shelf life conditions are recommended.
