<p>For pomegranate (
 <italic>Punica granatum</italic> L.), a highly nutritional and commercially important fruit, pathogens, namely 
 <italic>B. cinerea</italic> and 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp., were identified as the main causal agents of wound and latent infections leading to decay [

 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, studies have been initiated to investigate biodegradable treatments as alternatives to replace the synthetic fungicide application on pomegranate and other fruit types.
