<p>Decay incidence caused by pathogens affects fresh produce resulting in postharvest losses, often translating to marked economic losses on the supply chain [

 <xref rid="B2-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Decay reduces food safety, sensory quality, and shortens the storage and shelf life of fresh produce [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Furthermore, losses due to decay limit the availability of fresh produce on the market, causing exorbitant prices, which restrict market growth [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Research shows that decay occurs on the supply chain of fresh horticultural produce during several phases, including transportation, cold storage and shelf life [
