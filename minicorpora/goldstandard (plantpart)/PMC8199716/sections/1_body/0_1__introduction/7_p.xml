<p>The antimicrobial properties of EOs and PEs have been documented extensively [

 <xref rid="B51-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Furthermore, studies have explained the mode of action of several EOs and PEs with different constituent compounds [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. From such studies, several authors have derived the optimal concentration of EOs and PEs for the formulation of ECs from the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for a broad spectrum of pathogens [

 <xref rid="B53-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The MIC is often assigned to the smallest concentration of EO or PE, which prevents the growth of a test microorganism [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This technique is often effective to optimize the concentration of active components of ECs for the best quality of the final food product. However, differences have been noted in MIC values in studies conducted for the same EOs and/or PEs. For instance, the MIC value reported for LO (
 <italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic>) against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> was 0.25%, which was higher than 0.12% reported by Naik et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and Guerreiro et al. [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Both Faleiro [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and Hyldgaard [
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] attributed the difference in test strains and methodology used as major factors affecting MIC values observed. In addition, EOs and PEs often have different aromatic compounds even when they are extracted from the same plant [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Therefore, in developing novel ECs for fresh food preservation, it is important to determine the optimal concentration of candidate bioactive ingredients before the formulation process.
