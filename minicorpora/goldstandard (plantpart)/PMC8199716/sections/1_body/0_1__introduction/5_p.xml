<p>Non-volatile plant extracts (PEs) derived from materials such as pomegranate peel, grape pomace, garlic and ginger, are also an alternative to synthetic fungicides used to exert antimicrobial effects against pathogenic microorganisms on fresh produce/food products [

 <xref rid="B32-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. These products are extracted from plants using solvents, microwave, and ultrasonic assisted methods, and are further purified for use as antimicrobial agents on fresh produce [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The major components of PEs includes compounds such as quercetin, gallic acid, kaempferol, and flavan-3-ols catechin, which are responsible for antimicrobial effects against fungi (

 <italic>Penicillium digitatum</italic>) [

 <xref rid="B34-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Successful application of PEs to control decay has been reported for citrus [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], sweet cherries [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], papaya [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], mango [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and many others. For instance, Nicosia et al. (35) reported that application of pomegranate peel extract (PPE)(1.2 and 12 g/L) on artificially inoculated sweet cherries and lemon reduced the incidence of postharvest rots caused by fungi (
 <italic>B. cinerea</italic> and 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp.) during storage at room temperature (22–24 °C). Similar to EOs, research work on the application of PEs to extend storage and the life of pomegranate fruit is still limited.
