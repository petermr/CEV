<p>When EOs and PEs are applied on fresh produce or food products to enrich postharvest treatments such as edible coatings, modified atmospheric packaging, controlled atmosphere storage, refrigeration and irradiation, studies have reported the maintenance of microbial and sensory quality [

 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In particular, the incorporation of EOs and PEs into edible coatings (ECs) widens their functionality to become carriers of active compounds and has been found to reduce microbial proliferation [

 <xref rid="B45-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] showed that pre-storage application of nanochitosan (1%) coating solutions containing PPE (1%) significantly reduced microbial proliferation in ‘Rival’ apricot fruit which minimized the decay incidence during 30 days of cold storage (4 °C). Despite the widespread application of EOs and PEs on food products, a few challenges have been reported in their application. When applied in large amounts, the odour of EOs often intensifies, which may negatively alter the final sensory quality of food products [

 <xref rid="B47-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Likewise, the incorporation of high concentration of PEs in ECs may result in off-flavours. Perumalla and Hettiarachchy [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] identified several factors affecting the selection of PEs for use in ECs, including cost effectiveness, final sensory quality of food product, availability, and bioactive properties. Cerqueira et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] outlined that, while higher concentration of PEs is associated with greater antioxidant capacity, the active components of PEs may negatively alter permeability, thermal, and mechanical properties of the ECs.
