<p>The use of essential oils as an alternative to synthetic fungicides has shown great potential to control postharvest diseases in fresh produce [

 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Essentials oils (EOs) are volatile, partially flammable, and contain aromatic compounds which are extracted by hydrodistillation or pressing processes [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The major components of EOs responsible for inherent antimicrobial and antioxidant properties include terpenes, polyphenols, terpenoids, quinones, flavonoids, aldehydes, fatty acids, alkaloids, and lectins [

 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Essential oils such as lemongrass (LO), thyme (TO), carvacrol, clove, cinnamon and oregano (OO) have the “generally regarded as safe” (GRAS) status and, therefore, can be used for fresh produce preservation [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Traditionally, EOs have been used for flavouring of food products, alternative medicine, sanitation, phytotherapy, and food preservation [

 <xref rid="B28-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. For example, a study reported by Ali et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] proved that LO (28 µL·L
 <sup>−1</sup>) vapour reduced the development of anthracnose on Papaya (
 <italic>Carica papaya</italic> L.) during nine days of storage at ambient temperature (25 °C). Most EOs reduce microbial proliferation by directly lowering mycelial growth and spore germination by minimizing cellular metabolism [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In addition, hydrophobic EOs reportedly reduce microbial growth by disrupting cell membrane integrity and promoting electrolyte leakage leading to cell death [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Despite numerous studies showing EOs as a biodegradable postharvest treatment to control decay in stone and pome fruit, few studies have been extended to study the effect of EOs on other commercially important fruit types, including pomegranate.
