<p>The chemical composition of EOs has been extensively studied. The results for chemical composition of LO resembles the study reported by Munhuweyi et al. [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], who similarly found alcohols, monoterpenoids, ketones, and aldehydes in the profile. For TO, the results corroborate with Borugă et al. [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] who identified thymol, gamma-terpinene, and para-cymene as the major components, as previously reported by Grigore et al. [
 <xref rid="B59-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The results from this study agreed with Tavakoli et al. [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] who found carvacrol (30.73%), thymol (18.81%), para-cymene (10.88%), caryophyllene (7.73%), and 3-carene (4.06%) as the main components of OO. These compounds are classified under sesquiterpenes, monoterpene, sesquiterpenoids, monoterpenoids, ketones and phenylpropene as observed in this current study. However, difference were observed in the composition of OO from the study reported by Quiroga et al. [
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] who found γ-terpinene (32.10%), α-terpinene (15.10%), p-cymene (8.00%) and thymol (8.00%) as the major components. The differences observed in the composition of EOs from the previous related can be ascribed to several factors including the extraction process, part of the plant used for extraction, seasonal variation, and other factors [
