<p>The remarkable antioxidant properties of PPE have been reported in several studies [

Pomegranate peel extract is rich in polyphenolic compounds, which accounts for the inherent natural antioxidant property, which may translate into biological actions such as antimicrobial activity, anti-tyrosinase activity, and others [

 <xref rid="B75-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. The polyphenolic compounds in PPE include anthocyanins, catechins, flavonoids, punicalin, pedunculagin, punicalagin, ellagic acid, and many others [

 <xref rid="B77-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] observed the strongest antioxidant activity as determined by DPPH radical scavenging method for OO compared to EOs derived from thyme (

 <italic>Thymus serpyllum</italic> L.). The observed difference in RSA from previous studies can be attributed to the different chemical composition of EOs and extraction techniques used for extracts [
