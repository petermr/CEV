<p>The results showed that coating treatments formulated with LO recorded the widest ZI against tested microorganisms (
 <italic>B. cinerea</italic> and 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp.), in particular, treatments with double the MIC (CH
 <sub>2MIC</sub> and AG
 <sub>2MIC</sub>). Lemongrass oil incorporated in AG and CH produced antimicrobial coatings which exhibited antifungal properties, as reported in previous studies [
