 <sub>2MIC</sub>, CH
 <sub>MIC</sub>, and CH
 <sub>2MIC</sub> can be explained by the inherent antimicrobial properties of both LO and CH [

 <xref rid="B79-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Munhuweyi et al. [
 <xref rid="B80-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] found that in vivo and in vitro, chitosan could inhibit the growth of 
 <italic>B. cinerea</italic> and decay incidence by 18 to 66%. Similarly, research work demonstrated the efficacy of LO (10 and 50 g·L
 <sup>−1</sup>) incorporated into CH to completely inhibit the growth of 
 <italic>B</italic>
 <italic>. cinerea</italic> and 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp. of pomegranate fruit [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. During spore germination, new wall layers are formed between the original wall and the cytoplasm of fungi to promote the formation of new spores [
 <xref rid="B81-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. However, the application of LO disrupts cell membrane integrity leading to cell death, therefore, minimizing spore germination [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The antifungal effect of CH are well documented [
 <xref rid="B82-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>], however, the similar effect of CH and AG coatings on spore germination for the test fungi (
 <italic>B. cinerea</italic> and 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp.) suggests that AG also exhibits antimicrobial effects, previously observed when tested against Gram negative bacteria [
