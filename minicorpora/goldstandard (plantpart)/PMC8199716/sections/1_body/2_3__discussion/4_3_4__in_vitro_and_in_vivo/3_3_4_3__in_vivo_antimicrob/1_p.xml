<p>The coating solutions formulated with LO showed the greater reduction in decay severity against test strains (
 <italic>B. cinerea</italic> and 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp.) than other coatings without LO. This was more pronounced in trials 1 and 2 for 
 <italic>B. cinerea.</italic> Furthermore, for 
 <italic>B. cinerea</italic>, doubling the concentration of LO (15 to 30 µL/mL) incorporated into CH and AG coatings resulted in lower decay severity than other coated and uncoated fruit. Azarakhsh et al. [
 <xref rid="B85-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] showed that LO (0.1–0.5% 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) incorporated into an alginate-based (0.3% and 0.5% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) coatings significantly reduced yeast and mould counts and total plate counts of coated samples compared to uncoated fresh-cut pineapple. Likewise, researchers have shown a reduction in microbial proliferation when LO-based coatings are applied on fresh-cut apples [
 <xref rid="B87-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>], fresh-cut melon [
 <xref rid="B88-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], and others. In contrast, for 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp., the overall decay severity reduction by CH and AG coating treatments was lower than 
 <italic>B. cinerea</italic>. This was further supported by higher MIC value (30 µL/mL) for 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp. than 
 <italic>B. cinerea</italic> (MIC = 15 µL/mL). We speculate that 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp. may exhibit more resistance to antifungal effects of the coating solutions prepared in this study than 
 <italic>B. cinerea.</italic>
