<p>The agar well and disc diffusion tests are two of the most common techniques used to determine the antimicrobial activity of plants or microbial extracts [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Overall, wider zones of inhibition (ZI) were observed when using agar well diffusion test than disc diffusion test. Furthermore, there were difference in ZI observed between the two methods for the same EOs/PEs for the fungi tested. From the methodology, the volume of EOs/PEs used to fill agar wells (100 µL) was larger than the volume applied to paper discs (20 µL). Therefore, we speculate that for the agar well method, there was high diffusion potential due to the volume of EOs/PEs in contact with test fungi, which may have increased the surface area to exert antifungal effects. Studies have highlighted the demerits of disc diffusion test including the inaccurate testing of slow growing micro-organisms due to the loss of microbial extracts by evaporation [
