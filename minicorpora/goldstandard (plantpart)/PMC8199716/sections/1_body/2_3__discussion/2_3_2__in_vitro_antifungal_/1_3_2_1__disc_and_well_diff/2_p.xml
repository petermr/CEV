<p>The results showed that EOs exhibited higher antifungal activity than PEs against the fungi (
 <italic>B. cinerea</italic> and 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp.) tested for both disc and well diffusion test. Lemongrass oil showed the greatest antifungal activity followed by either OO or TO. The study reported by Tzortzakis and Economakis [
 <xref rid="B65-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] found that LO (25–500 ppm) inhibited fungal sporulation and spore germination of the examined pathogens including 
 <italic>B. cinerea</italic>. Similarly, studies by Guynot et al. [
 <xref rid="B66-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] demonstrated the potential of LO against several fungi, including 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp. In a comparative study, LO and cinnamon oil exhibited the strongest in vitro antifungal activity of all EO
 <sub>S</sub> tested with an MIC of 15 µL against 
 <italic>B. cinerea</italic> [
 <xref rid="B67-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. However, the study reported by Reang et al. [
 <xref rid="B68-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] identified TO as the EO with the maximum growth inhibition of 
 <italic>B. cinerea</italic> when compared to clove, lavender, lemongrass, and peppermint. The LO used in this study had over 55% citral content (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03367-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), lower than 69% than reported by Tzortzakis and Economakis [
 <xref rid="B65-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. This suggests that the antifungal activity of LO is a combined effect of all aromatic compounds and not only the main component citral as confirmed by Ma-In et al. [
 <xref rid="B69-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>].
