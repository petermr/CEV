<p>The results corroborate with Siripornvisal et al. [
 <xref rid="B67-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] who found the in vitro MIC of LO as 15 µL/mL when tested against 
 <italic>B. cinerea</italic>. However, for 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp., the results were not in accordance with Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B70-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], who observed the MIC of LO as 20 µL/mL, which was lower than 30 µL/mL found in this study. Several factors contribute to the difference in MIC values, which include the major components of EOs, extraction method and difference in fungi strain being tested [
