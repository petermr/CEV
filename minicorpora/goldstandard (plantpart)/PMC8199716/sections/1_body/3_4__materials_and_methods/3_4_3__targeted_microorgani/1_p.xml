<p>Previous studies reported by Munhuweyi et al. [
 <xref rid="B91-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>] identified 
 <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> and 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp. as some of the major decay causing pathogens in pomegranate fruit. These microbes were isolated from diseased pomegranate fruit during cold storage (5 ± 1 °C, 95 ± 2% RH). Pathogenicity and virulence of isolated microorganism were investigated and confirmed according to the Koch’s postulates [

 <xref rid="B91-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Fungal pathogens were grown in Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) (Biolab, Modderfontein, South Africa) incubated at 25 °C for 8 to 14 days to obtain actively growing spores [

 <sup>−1</sup> was added to the PDA plates of each fungal colony. Finally, the resultant spores were counted using haemocytometer (Neubauer, Marienfeld-Superior, Lauda-Konigshofen, Germany) and optical microscope (Leica Wild M8 Transmitted Light Stereo Microscope, Wild Heerbrugg, Switzerland) and adjusted to a concentration of 1 × 10
