<p>Determination of radical scavenging activity with 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay was carried out following the procedure reported by Torres-Martínez et al. [
 <xref rid="B96-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>] with some modifications. Briefly, in triplicates, 100 µL of different concentrations (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 mg/mL) of EOs and PEs were mixed with 2 mL of 0.5 mmol/L DPPH in methanol. After 20 min incubation, absorbance was determined spectrophotometrically at 517 nm. The percentage of free radical-scavenging capacity was calculated by Equation (1):
 <disp-formula>Radical scavenging capacity (%) = (A
  <sub>blank</sub> − A
  <sub>sample</sub>)/A
  <sub>blank</sub> × 100,
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where A
 <sub>sample</sub> represents the absorbance of DPPH mixed with essential oil/plant extract and A
 <sub>blank</sub> is the absorbance of DPPH in which sample has been replaced with methanol.
