<p>The procedure reported by Torres-Martínez et al. [
 <xref rid="B96-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>] was carried out to determine radical scavenging capacity using 2,2′-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) assay. The ABTS working solution was prepared from potassium persulfate (2.6 mM) and ABTS (2.6 mM). Briefly, in triplicates, 200 µL of ABTS working solution was added to 15 µL of test sample into wells and the absorbance was determined spectrophotometrically at 750 nm. The percentage of free radical-scavenging capacity was calculated by Equation (2), 
 <disp-formula>Radical scavenging (%) = 100 − ([A
  <sub>sample</sub> − A
  <sub>blank</sub>]/A
  <sub>control</sub> × 100),
  <label>(2)</label>
 </disp-formula> where A
 <sub>sample</sub> represent the absorbance of the ABTS mixed with the test sample, A
 <sub>control</sub> represents the absorbance of the ABTS mixed with milli-Q water, and A
 <sub>blank</sub> represents the absorbance of the sample mixed with milli-Q water.
