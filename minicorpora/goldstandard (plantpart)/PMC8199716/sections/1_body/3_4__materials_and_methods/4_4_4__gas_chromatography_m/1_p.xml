<p>Essential oils (EOs), namely lemongrass (LO) (
 <italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic>), thyme (TO) (
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic>), and oregano (OO) (
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic>), were purchased from Umuthi Botanicals (Western Cape, South Africa). All the EOs were stored at 4 °C before gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Volatile organic compounds of EOs were determined by a GC-MS technique using an Agilent 6890N GC (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA, USA) gas chromatograph coupled with an Agilent 5975 B MS (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA, USA) mass selective detector as reported by Munhuweyi et al.

 <sup>−1</sup>) was used as a carrier gas and EOs were individually diluted in hexane (1:10,000), and following that, 1 mL of the mixture was injected into the column with a split ratio of 10:1. Settings for running the oven were; 50 °C for 3 min, then ramped up to 80 °C at the rate of 4 °C·min
 <sup>−1</sup> for 2.5 min; and, finally ramped up to 250 °C at a rate of 10 °C·min
 <sup>−1</sup>, and held for 3 min. Compounds were identified by their retention times (RT). Mass spectra obtained for each sample was compared with the National Institute of Standards and Technology library (NIST; version 2.0). The mean (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3) percentage relative abundances of compounds based on the integrated peaks were used [
