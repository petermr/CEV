<p>Pomegranates were manually peeled with sterilized knives (Sigma-Aldrich, Johannesburg, South Africa), and the peels were collected at −80 °C in airtight containers for further use. The fruit peels were cut into small pieces before being oven-dried in an oven dryer (Model nr. 072160, Prolab Instruments, Sep Sci., Cape Town, South Africa) operated at an air velocity of 1.0 m/s, parallel to the drying surface of peels at 50 °C until reaching a no weight change [

Subsequently, the solution was centrifuged for 10 min in a refrigerated (4 °C) centrifuge (Sigma 3–18 K, Osterode, Germany) operating at 4000 rpm. The extract was subjected to a rotary evaporator (G3 Heidolph, Schwabach, Germany) (40 °C) under low pressure to remove the solvent. Following that, extracts were filtered under vacuum through Whatman No.1 filter paper at room temperature for 24 h, and the filtrate was collected.
