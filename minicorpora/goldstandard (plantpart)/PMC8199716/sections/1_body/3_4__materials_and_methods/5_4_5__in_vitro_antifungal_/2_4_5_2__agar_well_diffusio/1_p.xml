<p>Determination of antifungal activity was done according to Torres-Martínez et al. [
 <xref rid="B95-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>] with some modifications. Briefly, each plate was inoculated with a spore suspension (1 × 10
 <sup>9</sup> spores·L
 <sup>−1</sup>) of the test organism (
 <italic>B. cinerea</italic> and 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> sp.) and spread over the plate using a sterile rod and allowed to dry for 3 to 5 min (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03367-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The EOs and PEs were diluted in ethanol (99.9%) at different concentrations (0.02–1 µL/mL). In triplicates, holes (~0.6 cm diameter each) were cut on PDA plates using a sterile cork borer and filled with 0.1 mL of each test solution (EO or PE). Test plates were incubated at 26 °C in the dark and the zones of inhibition (mm) were measured 4 days after inoculation. Ethanol (99.9%) and cycloheximide (1000 ppm) were used as controls.
