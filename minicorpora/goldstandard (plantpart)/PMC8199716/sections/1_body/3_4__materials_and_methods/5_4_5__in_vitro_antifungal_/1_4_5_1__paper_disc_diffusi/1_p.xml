<p>The paper disc diffusion test was carried out to initially screen EOs and PEs for antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="B94-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. The EOs and PEs were diluted in ethanol (99.9%) to different concentrations (0.02–1 µL/mL). Each plate was inoculated with a spore suspension (1 × 10
 <sup>9</sup> spores·L
 <sup>−1</sup>) of the test organism (
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>cinerea</italic> or 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> sp.), spread over the plate using a sterile rod and allowed to dry for 3 to 5 min (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03367-f007">Figure 7</xref>). In triplicates, 0.6 cm discs (Munktell, Falun, Sweden) were inoculated with EOs or PEs (20 µL) and placed at the centre of the PDA (Neogen, Lancashire, UK) plate. Ethanol (99.9%) and cycloheximide (1000 ppm) were used as controls. Ethanol (99.9%) was the positive control, and cycloheximide (1000 ppm) was the negative control. Ethanol was used in diluting the EOs/PEs and was expected to offer very low antifungal effects, whereas cycloheximide is a fungicide/antibiotic produced by the bacterium 
 <italic>Streptomyces griseus</italic> with known antifungal activity. Test plates were incubated at 26 °C in the dark, and the zones of inhibition (mm) were determined 4 days after inoculation.
