<p>Minimum inhibitory concentration was identified as the lowest concentration in which the visible growth of test strains was observable [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Briefly, selected concentrations (0.5–50 µL/mL) of EOs were incorporated into PDA and poured into petri dishes. Agar discs (0.3 cm in diameter) covered with germinated fungal conidia served as a source of inoculums and were placed at the center of Petri dishes containing PDA with the corresponding EO. Petri dishes were sealed with parafilm to prevent the leak of test oils. The plates without EOs were used as control. The plates were incubated for 5 to 7 days and the mycelium growth (mm) was measure and expressed as a percentage of the control.
