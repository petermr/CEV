<p>To determine the zones of inhibition (ZI), 50 µL of CH and AG coating solutions were pipetted into the agar wells in plates inoculated with spore suspension (1 × 10
 <sup>9</sup> spores·L
 <sup>−1</sup>) of test fungi (either 
 <italic>B. cinerea</italic> or 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp.) as described by method used by Vásconez et al. [
 <xref rid="B100-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. After 24 h of incubation (30 °C), the inhibition zones around the wells were measured in triplicates and expressed in (mm).
