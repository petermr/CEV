<p>The effects of CH and AG coatings on 
 <italic>B. cinerea</italic> and 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp. spore germination were determined as described by Adebayo et al. [
 <xref rid="B99-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>], with slight modifications. Briefly, in triplicates, 50 mL aliquots of the spore suspension (1 × 10
 <sup>9</sup> spores·L
 <sup>−1</sup>) drops of test fungi (either 
 <italic>B. cinerea</italic> or 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp.) were spread on potato dextrose agar medium supplemented with coating solutions. The plates were incubated at 22 °C for 10 to 12 h and thereafter, a drop of lactophenol cotton blue was applied to the inoculation sites on the plates to stop germination. A hand-held digital micrometer (Mitutoyo, Tokyo, Japan) under a light microscope (Olympus BX41, Tokyo, Japan) was used to determine the percentage of spore germination. Three replicate plates were used for coating solutions and a minimum of 100 spores were counted in each replicate.
