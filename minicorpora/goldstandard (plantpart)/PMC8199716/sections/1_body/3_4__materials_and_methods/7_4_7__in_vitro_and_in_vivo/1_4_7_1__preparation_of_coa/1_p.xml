<p>All the coating solutions used for in vivo investigations were prepared using different concentrations of LO. The procedure reported by Gol et al. [
 <xref rid="B97-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>] was adopted to formulate chitosan coatings. One gram of water soluble chitosan (CH)(Alfa chemistry, New York, USA) powder was dissolved in 100 mL of warm milli-Q water (25 °C) and thereafter, glycerol (1%
