<p>The in vivo determination of antimicrobial activity of coating solutions from the selected EO was done following a method reported by Munhuweyi et al. [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-26-03367" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] with slight modifications. Briefly, two wounds (5 mm deep by 5 mm wide) were made on the opposite sides of the sanitized pomegranate fruit. The wounds were inoculated with spore containing either 10
 <sup>5</sup> spores/mL of 
 <italic>B. cinerea</italic> or 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp. Inoculated fruit were then dipped into either CH or AG coating with LO (1.5%, 3% and 6% 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>). The controls were acetic acid (pH = 5, 10 g·L
 <sup>−1</sup>) with no EO and uncoated fruit. Evaluation was done on day 10 of storage (at 22 °C for 
 <italic>B. cinerea</italic> and 25 °C for 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> sp.) on artificially inoculated fruit (3 replicates of 5 fruit each) and the experiment was repeated twice. Decay severity reduction (%) according to Equation (3), 
 <disp-formula>Decay severity reduction (%) = [(L
  <sub>f</sub> − L
  <sub>c</sub>)/L
  <sub>c</sub>] × 100,
  <label>(3)</label>
 </disp-formula> where L
 <sub>c</sub> represents lesion diameter for treated fruit and L
 <sub>f</sub> represents lesion diameter for control fruit.
