    "This study determined the antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of lemongrass (LO), thyme (TO), and oregano (OO) essential oils and ethanolic extracts of pomegranate peel (PPE) and grape pomace (GPE) as candidate ingredients for edible coatings. Antifungal effects against <i>Botrytis</i>&nbsp;<i>cinerea</i> and <i>Penicillium</i> spp. were tested using paper disc and well diffusion methods. Radical scavenging activity (RSA) was evaluated using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and 2,2'-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid assays. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis identified limonene (16.59%), α-citral (27.45%), β-citral (27.43%), thymol (33.31%), paracymene (43.26%), 1,8-cineole (17.53%), and trans-caryphellene (60.84%) as major compounds of the essential oils. From both paper disc and well diffusion methods, LO recorded the widest zone of inhibition against tested microbes (<i>B. cinerea</i> and <i>Penicillium</i> spp.). The minimum inhibitory concentrations of LO against <i>B. cinerea</i> and <i>Penicillium</i> spp., were 15 µL/mL and 30 µL/mL, respectively. The highest (69.95%) and lowest (1.64%) RSA at 1 mg/mL were recorded for PPE and OO. Application of sodium alginate and chitosan-based coatings formulated with LO (15 or 30 µL/mL) completely inhibited spore germination and reduced the decay severity of 'Wonderful' pomegranate. Lemongrass oil proved to be a potential antifungal agent for edible coatings developed to extend shelf life of 'Wonderful' pomegranate."
