  <title>Simple Summary</title>
  <p>In a globally strained context where food production constantly challenges biodiversity, the importance of insect activity to crop pollination is at stake, as insects are essential to more than 75% of global crops. Despite this awareness, there is still a gap of knowledge about the importance of pollinators for aromatic crops. Fennel is an aromatic plant cultivated in the South of France for its essential oil, which is of great economic interest. Here, we explored the effect of the abundance and richness of insects caught at the edge of fennel crops on the yield of essential oil. We found that high insect richness improves fennel essential oil yield. In this context, it appeared important to know what structured the insect communities we trapped. By calculating indices describing the landscape, we have shown that rather than the type of habitat surrounding them, it is the arrangement of habitats that affected the abundance and richness of insects. As these results, confirmed the importance of maintaining complex landscapes to sustain both flower-visiting insect populations and crop yield, they will be of interest to fennel producers.</p>

  <p>Agricultural landscapes are increasingly characterized by intensification and habitat losses. Landscape composition and configuration are known to mediate insect abundance and richness. In the context of global insect decline, and despite 75% of crops being dependent on insects, there is still a gap of knowledge about the link between pollinators and aromatic crops. Fennel (
   <italic>Foeniculum vulgare</italic>) is an aromatic plant cultivated in the South of France for its essential oil, which is of great economic interest. Using pan-traps, we investigated the influence of the surrounding habitats at landscape scale (semi-natural habitat proportion and vicinity, landscape configuration) and local scale agricultural practices (insecticides and patch size) on fennel-flower-visitor abundance and richness, and their subsequent impact on fennel essential oil yield. We found that fennel may to be a generalist plant species. We did not find any effect of intense local management practices on insect abundance and richness. Landscape configuration and proximity to semi-natural habitat were the main drivers of flying insect family richness. This richness positively influenced fennel essential oil yield. Maintaining a complex configuration of patches at the landscape scale is important to sustain insect diversity and crop yield.
