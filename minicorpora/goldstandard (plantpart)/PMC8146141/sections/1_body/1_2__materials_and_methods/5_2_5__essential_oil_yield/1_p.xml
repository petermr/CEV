<p>The amount of essential oil (EO) obtained from each field was provided by farmers. Fennel EO comes from the hydro-distillation of aerial parts of the plant, which contain the “
 <italic>trans</italic>-anethole” as a major component (
 <italic>Jupiter</italic> variety of fennel contains at least 70% of 
 <italic>trans</italic>-anethole in its essential oil). During harvest, cut plant material was immediately collected and stored in closed tanks that were then used for hydro-distillation in cooperative stills (maximum three hours after harvest). Steam-distillation of fresh plant material lasted for two hours. Because the quantity of essential oil obtained is dependent on the parcel size, we expressed the yield in kilogram of essential oil per hectare (EO kg/ha).
