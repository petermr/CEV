<p>The environmental variable selection for modelling was assessed by generating a principal component analysis, a correlation matrix and correlation tests, excluding the collinear metric. This selection led us to keep, among all explanative variables, the percentage of SNH and the interspersion and juxtaposition index (IJI) at the landscape scale (at 1 km radius), the distance from our sites to the closest SNH (m), the parcel size (ha) and the total insecticide quantity (L/ha).</p>
