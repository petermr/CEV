<p>To analyze the landscape surrounding of each site, we modelled 1 km radius buffers using online GPR data (graphic parcel register), photo-interpretations on orthophotos, and field assessments (QGIS software 3.2 madeira). This radius was chosen because it encompasses most of the foraging distance of flying insects we trapped [
 <xref rid="B40-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. For each buffer, we categorized nine different land cover types, namely: ‘urban areas’, ‘water surface’, ‘SNH’, ‘MFC (mass flowering crops)’, ‘meadow’, ‘fallow’, ‘non-flowering crops’, ‘orchards’ and ‘other habitats’. Buffers were rasterized with a spatial resolution of 5 m × 5 m. We then calculated the proportion of each land cover (in percentage) at the 1 km radius. Then, using the Fragstats software 4.2.1 [
 <xref rid="B44-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], we calculated the interspersion and juxtaposition index (IJI) for each buffer. IJI is a measure of the landscape spatial configuration of habitats patches. This index tends toward 0 when patches of different land cover types are not adjacent to each other and are unequally distributed within a landscape. On the contrary, IJI tends toward 100 when patches of different land cover types are adjacent to each other’s and share borders [
 <xref rid="B45-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In other words, IJI measures habitat aggregation and land cover types mixing through the contiguity of the patch edges of different land cover types [
 <xref rid="B25-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Finally, as isolation from semi-natural habitats is known to influence the abundance and richness of flower visitors [
 <xref rid="B30-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], we measured the distance from each of our sampling site to the closest SNH (in meters).
