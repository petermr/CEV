<p>The study was carried out in the Mediterranean Basin, in the area named “
 <italic>Plateau de Valensole</italic>” (Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, South of France), on fennel crops cultivated for a local anise spirit production, called “
 <italic>pastis</italic>”. The cultivated aromatic variety of 
 <italic>Foeniculum vulgare</italic> is developed by the company Pernod-Ricard
 <sup>®</sup> and called “
 <italic>Jupiter</italic>”. As in many Apiaceae species, a protandry is supposed in fennel flowers (centripetal development, i.e., earlier anthers occur in outer flowers of umbels and outer umbellets within an umbel). Each flower contains five stamens, with a nectar-bearing surface at their base. Each fertilized fennel flower may lead to a fruit, which is a di-achene, and each achene can hold one seed. According to the sowing date, fennel can bloom from mid-June to October.
