<p>We selected ten fennel fields representative of the diversity of landscapes of the “
 <italic>Plateau de Valensole</italic>”. For each field, we selected one edge, which will represent our experimental sites, for a total of 10 sites. Five sites were immediately adjacent to woody semi-natural habitat (SNH) and five were not. The following were considered as SNH: hedgerows, woody boscages, and abandoned patches of truffle oaks. In the South of France, the fennel is sown at two periods of the year, resulting in two main flowering periods. The first flowering period begins at the end of June, peaks during July, and is harvested in early August. The second begins at the end of July, maximum blooming is in August and harvest occurs in mid-September. All the fields are, therefore, blooming synchronously between the last fortnight of July and the first fortnight of August. Among our 10 fields, five were issued from the first sowing period (three in SNH vicinity edge and two not) and five from the second one (two in SNH vicinity edge and three not).
