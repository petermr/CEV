<p>Regarding the essential oil yield, we also used linear mixed-effect models, but with a Gaussian family including a random effect on pan-trap color (glmer). Predictor variables were the abundance and family richness of flying insects. The best models were selected using the ‘dredge’ function (MuMin package of R version 4.0.2 2020-06-22) based on a comparison of their corrected Akaike Information Criterion-AICc, and subsequently included in the path-analysis. We always selected the model with the lowest AIC to set the path-analysis.</p>
