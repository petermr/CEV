<p>We performed the path-analysis using the “Piecewise SEM” package version 2.1.0 (R version 4.0.2 2020-06-22) [
 <xref rid="B46-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and following the Shipley Method [
 <xref rid="B48-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="B49-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Missing paths were added before interpretations of the final path-analysis coefficients. The residuals of all models were checked for homoscedasticity and normality and we checked for collinearity using variance inflation factors (VIFs) and the ‘car’ package.
