<p>We used generalized linear mixed effect models (glmer) with a Poisson error distribution including a random effect (experimental site identity) to explain the (1) abundance and (2) family richness of flying insects per sample. Predictor variables were the percentage of SNH and the IJI index at the landscape scale, the distance from each sample sites to closest SNH, the parcel size and the insecticide amount. </p>
