<p>Insects were caught through pan-trapping [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00404-f0A1">Figure A1</xref>). Pan-traps are very efficient at capturing insects without observer bias and are a good tool to understand the impact of landscape and local variables on insect communities, but are not a good method to precisely identify the pollinators of a given crops [
 <xref rid="B39-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Three colored pan-traps (one blue, one white and one yellow) were placed, aligned and separated from each other by two meters, in each experimental site. The pan-traps were filled with soapy water and left 24 h on site. Each site was sampled three times between June and September, during the respective flowering period of each field. In total, we collected 90 pan-trap samples. All insects were collected and stored in 70% ethanol. Then, they were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level and at least to the family level. For this study, we only kept flower-visiting insects, while parasite or predator insects were left out. Damaged insects were classified as “non-identified insects”.
