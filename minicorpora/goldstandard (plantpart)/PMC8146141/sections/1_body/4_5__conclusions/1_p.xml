<p>Our study is the first to quantify fennel essential oil variations according to the family richness and abundance of insects trapped along fennel crops. We highlighted that the landscape configuration and the vicinity to semi-natural habitats drives insect family richness. Further studies should investigate the ecological, morphological and behavioral traits of fennel-flower-visitors for a better understanding of the link between insects and fennel yield. It would also be interesting to go further in the measurement of the fennel yield, exploring various phytometabolite variations (especially the most valuable ones). As these results confirmed the importance of maintaining complex landscapes to sustain both flying insect populations and crop yield, they will be of interest to fennel managers and producers. </p>
