<p>To fill in the knowledge gap linking flower-visitor assemblages, pollination, and yield of fennel, we investigated flying insect community foraging at the edge of fennel crops using pan-trap. Using structural equation models, we explored how fennel yield essential oil can be linked to (1) the local management practices (insecticide, herbicide and fungicide use; irrigation; fertilizer and the size of parcels), (2) the landscape composition (land cover; distance to semi-natural habitats) and (3) the landscape configuration (interspersion and juxtaposition index) through the impact of these variables on the abundance and family richness of flying insects. Our results are discussed with a particular emphasis on the importance of maintaining complex landscapes to sustain both abundant insect populations and crop yield. </p>
