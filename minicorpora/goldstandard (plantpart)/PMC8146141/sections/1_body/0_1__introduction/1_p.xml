<p>In a globally strained context, where food production constantly challenges biodiversity, the importance of insect activity to crop pollination is at stake, as insects are essential to the production of more than 75% of fruits, seeds, and vegetables [

 <xref rid="B2-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The delivery of pollination service to crops is a known factor to improve the production of many cultivated species, such as in tomatoes [
 <xref rid="B1-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] or field beans [
 <xref rid="B5-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It can also increase fruit quality, for example, of apples, which are sweeter with an increased visitation rate [
 <xref rid="B6-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and in oilseed rape, which presents heavier seeds [
 <xref rid="B7-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In economic terms, the global value of the pollination service has been estimated between USD 235 and 577 billion per year [
 <xref rid="B8-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. While the link between many crops and their insect pollinators is quite well-known, especially for some of the main mass-flowering crops such as sunflower or rapeseed [
 <xref rid="B10-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], the role of insect pollinators in the agricultural production of some widespread cultivated plant species remains unclear. This is particularly the case for aromatic plants exploited for their secondary metabolites, such as medicinal hemp, lavender, mint, or fennel. Scarce studies have pointed out that self-pollination compared to cross- or open-pollination could impact the essential oil yield and secondary phytometabolite content, with major discrepancies such as self-pollination increasing essential oil yield in mint [
 <xref rid="B12-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], while decreasing it in fennel [
 <xref rid="B13-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Here, we aim to improve knowledge of the link between flower-visitor abundance and richness, and the production of essential oil among fennel (
