<p>The diversity and patterns of land cover and local management practices are known to be the main drivers structuring insect communities in crop systems [
 <xref rid="B22-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. At the landscape scale, it is widely accepted that the diversity of habitats and the landscape complexity have a positive effect on insect communities [
 <xref rid="B22-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Indeed, complex shapes and the arrangements of patches of different cover types are increasing the length of boundaries between potentially complementary resources [
 <xref rid="B26-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], enhancing landscape heterogeneity and pollinator biodiversity [
 <xref rid="B27-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In the same way, in agricultural landscapes, abundance and proximity to semi-natural habitats, useful for nesting and foraging alternative resources, can promote insect diversity [
 <xref rid="B1-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. As semi-natural habitats can also be a source of flower-visitors for crops [
 <xref rid="B29-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], various authors had pointed out that increasing semi-natural habitat-crops distance implies isolation, leads to a smaller flower-visitation rate [
 <xref rid="B30-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and decreases pollination service [
 <xref rid="B32-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. At a more local scale, the size of parcels [
 <xref rid="B34-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and the use of agrochemicals [
 <xref rid="B36-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] are widely known to be strong markers of agricultural intensification that negatively affect flower-visiting insects [
 <xref rid="B37-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. All components of agricultural intensification, expressed at a landscape or a local scale, are related and partially additive [
 <xref rid="B22-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and must be considered together to understand the link between agricultural intensification, insect community structure, and crop yields.
