<p>Beside landscape composition and configuration, agricultural practices can impact insect abundance and richness; effects at the local and landscape scale are often additive [

 <xref rid="B28-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. An increase in croplands in a landscape is known to negatively influence insect abundance and diversity [

 <xref rid="B65-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], particularly when paired with the use of insecticides [
 <xref rid="B36-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and big crop size [

 <xref rid="B35-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Surprisingly, we did not show any link between local management practices and markers of agricultural intensification on fennel insect abundance and family richness. We propose four hypotheses to interpret this result. First, the negative effect could depend on the type of agricultural intensification, as in Le FÃ©on et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], who found different responses of bee assemblage between fallow and grazing lands. Secondly, agricultural intensification can be mitigated by other local or landscape features, such as surrounding habitat quality, according to Kennedy et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Thirdly, insect abundance and richness variations could be hidden because a critical threshold value in intensification was reached years ago; therefore, the current insect community would represent a remnant of the historical biodiversity, composed of tolerant species. Finally, the use of insecticide might be below the threshold that affects insect communities, with regard to amount or spreading periods [
 <xref rid="B66-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. We cannot settle this point at present, but further studies are in progress (see also 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app4-insects-12-00404">Appendix D</xref> for further discussions relative to this point).
