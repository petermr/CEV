<p>The interspersion and juxtaposition index relies to the configuration of landscape habitats, i.e., the arrangement of the different habitats’ patches in the landscape [

 <xref rid="B35-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This index thus reports the patch mixing and length of adjacencies between habitat type. In this way, an increase in IJI conveys an increase in the linear edges’ length between crops. Some studies showed that patch-mixing positively influences bee assemblages [

 <xref rid="B28-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], others found a negative effect of IJI on insect community [

 <xref rid="B62-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. We have shown that increasing IJI has positive impact on flying insect abundance and richness. Indeed, an increase in the linear edges length between crops may facilitate access to varied resources for insects and can be complementary for their life cycles [

 <xref rid="B63-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. For example, many local wild bee species are nesting in pre-existing cavities in dead wood [
 <xref rid="B64-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], and such species could benefit from being close to both lavender (for nectar) and fennel (for nectar and pollen) while foraging. In this way, a high IJI is beneficial for these species.
