 <xref rid="B28-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] are important drivers of insect assemblages. Semi-natural habitats are known to offer shelters for insects, including a wide range of nesting sites and a diversity of floral resources [

 <xref rid="B53-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Therefore, the literature widely reports that increasing SNH proportion in the landscape has a positive effect on insect abundance and/or richness [

 <xref rid="B55-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Our results did not link SNH proportion and insect abundance/richness. This has already been shown previously, with SNH having no effect [

 <xref rid="B56-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] or a negative effect [
 <xref rid="B25-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] on bee abundance and diversity. an explanation could lie in the type of SNH considered (with herbaceous being more attractive than woody) [
 <xref rid="B57-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], or because of a dilution effect due to other mass-flowering crops attracting insects [

 <xref rid="B58-insects-12-00404" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. However, even if we found no effect of the proportion of SNH on insects, we have shown that the increasing distance to SNH is negatively impacting flying insect richness in fennel fields. Being in the vicinity of SNH has been previously acknowledged to increase abundance [
