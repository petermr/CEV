 <italic>Foeniculum vulgare</italic> in our system seems to be a generalist plant species, attracting a great diversity of insects along its edges. The main insect trapped belonged to the Apidae bees, almost entirely represented by the managed honeybee 
 <italic>Apis mellifera</italic>, followed by Coleopterans. Increasing distance to the closest SNH decreases insect family richness. We showed that landscape configuration mediates insect communities more than SNH proportion. Surprisingly, we found no effect of the local agricultural practices on insect communities. We confirmed that the family richness of flying insects plays a major role in fennel crops, positively driving the fennel essential oil yield.
