<p>Regarding the nitrogen content, we found that in Colaisaca (L4) there was a higher concentration of this element with a range between 9.81 to 12.05 ppm, showing significant differences compared to the other three study locations. The localities of Yangana (L2) and Celica (L3) had similar contents among themselves, and Chuquiribamba (L1) was the one with the lowest contents with the range of 3.7 to 8.8 ppm of nitrogen. Aluminum was another chemical element that had a high variability of results in each sampling area. Aluminum concentrations ranged from 1.11 to 15.99 ppm, with the highest value being found for L4. As for the sodium content, a great difference can be observed in the values of L1 with respect to the other three location, in L1 there are the highest values ranging between 4.73 to 4.84 ppm. Silicon has a similar tendency to sodium, since the highest values were found in samples from L1, reaching up to 7.23 ppm. For the elements of potassium, calcium and magnesium, there is also a great variability of results, for potassium from 0.78 to 1.99 ppm, for calcium, values between 0.78 to 4.05 ppm and for magnesium, values between 0.29 to 3.51 ppm.</p>
