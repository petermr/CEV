<p>The enantiomeric distribution by GC/MS was determined in the MEGA DEX-DET-BETA stationary phase capillary column, by modifying the enantiomeric separation of β-pinene, limonene, δ-elemene, β-bourbonene, cis-cadina-1(6),4-diene and atractylone (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02949-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The enantiomeric distribution and the enantiomeric excess (e.e.) values of some monoterpenes were determined. None of the detected chiral compounds were present in their enantiomerically pure forms, however, δ-elemene was almost racemic, with only a small e.e. in favor of (−)-δ-elemene.
