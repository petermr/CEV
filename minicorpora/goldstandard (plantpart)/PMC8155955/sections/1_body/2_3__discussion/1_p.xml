<p>In our work we show that there are influences of soil and plant chemical elements in the composition of the essential oils of 
 <italic>Siparuna muricata</italic>. We also observe that the nutrient content of the soil and the plant, as well as the chemical composition of the essential oil, are strongly influenced by the sampling location. Other studies found α-pinene (24.3%), β-pinene (21.7%) and myrcene (11.3%) in 
 <italic>Siparuna echinate</italic> (Khunt) as major compounds [
