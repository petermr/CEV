<p>The high and increasing market value of essential oils could allow the exploitation of forest resources to be economically viable. Among the species considered of interest from the point of view of their essential oil content and biomass products, seven were selected in this work due to their high availability in both wild and cultivated forms. Four of them were tree species—
 <italic>Eucalyptus globulus Labill.</italic>, 
 <italic>Eucalyptus nitens Maiden</italic>, 
 <italic>Pinus pinaster Aiton</italic>, and 
 <italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic> L.—and three of them were shrub species—
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L., 
 <italic>Cistus ladanifer</italic> L., and 
 <italic>Juniperus communis</italic> L. (
