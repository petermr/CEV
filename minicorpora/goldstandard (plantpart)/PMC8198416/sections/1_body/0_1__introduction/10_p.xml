<p>The objective of this research is twofold—on the one hand, to contribute to greater knowledge of the essential oil production on a pilot scale from foliage biomass of wild shrubs and tree residues produced in some forestry enhancement operations, and on the other hand, to study the antioxidant capacity (ORAC—oxygen radical absorbance capacity) of the essential oils obtained.</p>
