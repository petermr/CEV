<p>On the other hand, taking into account the antioxidant activity of the oils studied, and the abundance of the forest residues from which they can be obtained, they could be interesting natural sources of antioxidant additives with potential applications in the food industry as alternatives to synthetic antioxidants. Specifically, oxygenated sesquiterpenesâ€™ contents, one of the minor components of oils, were significantly correlated with ORAC values (

 <italic>Cistus ladanifer</italic> essential oil could increase the interest in this species because, despite its low essential oil yield, its availability in surface area in Spain is, by far, the highest among the studied species.
