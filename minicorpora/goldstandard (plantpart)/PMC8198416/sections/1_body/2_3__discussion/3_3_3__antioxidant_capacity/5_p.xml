<p>In relation to 
 <italic>Pinus</italic> essential oils, significant differences were found in antioxidant activity between essential oil of the two 
 <italic>Pinus</italic> species studied in the present work. 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic> essential oil showed the lowest activity evaluated by the ORAC assay of all plant materials, and similar results measured by the DPPH assay were found by Kačániová et al. [
 <xref rid="B87-molecules-26-03257" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. In contrast, 
 <italic>P. pinaster</italic> essential oil revealed higher activity than 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic>. Our results are in accordance with those reported by Tümen et al. [
 <xref rid="B88-molecules-26-03257" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], in which higher activity for essential oils from 
 <italic>P. pinaster</italic> was also observed, particularly for those obtained of the cones of this Pinus tree.
