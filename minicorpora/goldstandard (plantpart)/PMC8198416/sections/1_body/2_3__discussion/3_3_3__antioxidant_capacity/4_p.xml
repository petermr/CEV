<p>In our study, the essential oil of 
 <italic>J. communis</italic> presented similar ORAC values to those of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. pinaster</italic> essential oils. Other authors have also observed antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>J. communis</italic> measured by the DPPH method [
 <xref rid="B85-molecules-26-03257" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. When the antioxidant capacity of essential oils of different parts of 
 <italic>J. communis</italic> was evaluated, a strong antioxidant activity was detected for berries essential oil of 
 <italic>J. communis</italic> by ORAC (70.5 μmol Trolox/g) [
 <xref rid="B86-molecules-26-03257" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] and that of the leaves by the DPPH method [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-03257" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. As occurs with other essential oils, the main components of 
 <italic>J.</italic>
 <italic>communis</italic> essential oil (α-pinene, sabinene, and limonene), showed low or even no antioxidant activity determined by different antioxidant evaluation methods [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-03257" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-03257" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B82-molecules-26-03257" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. While 
 <italic>J. communis</italic> essential oil contains a low amount of γ-terpinene, which is a monoterpene with a particularly strong capacity [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-03257" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-03257" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Therefore, the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>Juniperus</italic> essential oils may also be due to other minor components, such as oxygenated sesquiterpenes.
