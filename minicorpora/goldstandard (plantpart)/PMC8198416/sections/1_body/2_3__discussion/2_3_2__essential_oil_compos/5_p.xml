<p>Considering the analyses of the essential oils of 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. nitens</italic> obtained, it can be observed that both essential oils are mainly composed of 1,8-cineole and α-pinene, being higher the concentration of 1,8-cineole in the samples corresponding to 
 <italic>E. nitens</italic>. In the work carried out by Dagne et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-26-03257" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], 1,8-cineole and 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene are also the main components in the essential oils of both species, although with similar values of 1,8-cineole.
