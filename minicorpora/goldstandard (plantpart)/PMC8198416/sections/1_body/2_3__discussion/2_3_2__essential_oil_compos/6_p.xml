<p>Concerning the composition of 
 <italic>J. communis</italic> essential oils, some authors have found that the main components from the essential oil obtained from leaves seem to be α-pinene and sabinene [

 <xref rid="B72-molecules-26-03257" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], with values of 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene between 21.7 and 89.7% and sabinene between 12.1 and 61.9% [
 <xref rid="B72-molecules-26-03257" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Nevertheless, other authors have found that 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene together with limonene are the most abundant compounds, with concentrations of 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene between 40.4 and 62.0% and limonene between 4.2 and 10.0% [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-03257" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In the samples analyzed in the present work, sabinene, 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene, and limonene are the main components, with values next to the lowest limits shown by the above-mentioned authors. Other compounds are also abundant, such as β-myrcene, β-phellandrene, γ-terpinene, α-thujene, thujopsene, and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-β-caryophyllene. They have also been found in 
 <italic>J. communis</italic> essential oils by different authors [
