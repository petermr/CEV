<p>The 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic> essential oils here analyzed showed high contents of 1,8-cineole, followed by α-pinene, aromadendrene, limonene, α-terpinyl acetate, and globulol, listing the compounds according to their decreasing quantities. Comparing these values with those set out by Barbosa et al. [
 <xref rid="B71-molecules-26-03257" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], it can be observed that 1,8-cineole is always the most abundant compound, with values between 21.4 and 90.0% in essential oils from different countries. The rest of the main compounds analyzed in the studies shown by Barbosa et al. [
 <xref rid="B71-molecules-26-03257" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] do not follow a common pattern. However, it must be considered that the chemical composition of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> essential oils depends on the plant stage, and consequently, the harvesting time has significant effects on the chemical composition of this oil [
