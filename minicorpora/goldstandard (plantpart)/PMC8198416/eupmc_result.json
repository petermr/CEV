    "Increasing applications and markets for essential oils could bring new opportunities for cost-effective and sustainable management of unused forestry biomass; however, better knowledge of the production and application of such essential oils is necessary. The objective of this work is to contribute to greater knowledge of the essential oil production on a pilot scale from foliage biomass of wild shrubs and tree residues produced in some forestry enhancement operations and to study their antioxidant capacity (ORAC-oxygen radical absorbance capacity). Fresh biomass (twigs) of seven species (<i>E. globulus</i>, <i>E. nitens</i>, <i>P. pinaster</i>, <i>P. sylvestris</i>, <i>R. officinalis</i>, <i>C. ladanifer</i>, and <i>J. communis</i>) was manually collected in Spain in two different periods and was ground at 30 mm and distilled in a 30 L stainless steel still with saturated steam. The essential oil components were identified by GC-MS and quantified by GC-FID, and their antioxidant activity was determined with the ORAC method. Promising results on essential oil yield were obtained with <i>E. globulus</i>, <i>E. nitens</i>, <i>R. officinalis,</i> and <i>J. communis</i>. All essential oils studied exhibited antioxidant capacity by the ORAC assay, particularly that from <i>C. ladanifer.</i> Moreover, oxygenated sesquiterpenes contents, one of the minor components of oils, were significantly correlated with ORAC values."
