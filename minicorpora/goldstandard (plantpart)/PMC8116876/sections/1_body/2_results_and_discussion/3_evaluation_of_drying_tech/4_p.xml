<p>The sesquiterpenes content was also affected by the drying technique employed. The results for hydrocarbon sesquiterpenes indicated that microwave and oven‐drying (60 and 80°C) methods significantly decreased these compositions. The maximum content of δ‐cadinene was produced by the freeze‐, oven‐ (40°C), and shade‐drying methods; nevertheless, its amount was significantly reduced by increasing temperatures using microwave and oven (60 and 80°C). The maximum amounts of α‐copaene (13.7%), germacrene‐D (9.5%) and E‐caryophyllene (5.2%) were obtained when freeze‐drying was used, displaying a notable enhancement compared with other drying methods (Table

Generally, sesquiterpenes have higher molecular weight than monoterpenes, and therefore, they are less fugacious and less easily removed from the plant material; as respects, they are sensitive to oxidation response and subjecting the samples to extended drying times would decrease the sesquiterpene compositions (Chua et al.,
