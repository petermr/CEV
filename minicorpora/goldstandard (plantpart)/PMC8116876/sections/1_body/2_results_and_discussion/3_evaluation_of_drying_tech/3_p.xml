<p>According to the results, the volatile compositions from 
 <italic>S. lavandulifolia</italic> were divided into three chemical groups: monoterpene hydrocarbons, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32218-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The results showed that sunlight‐, freeze‐drying, oven‐drying (at 40 and 80°C) and microwave‐drying significantly decreased amounts of hydrocarbon monoterpenes in comparison to shade‐drying. The most significant variations were observed in β‐pinene, α‐pinene, myrcene, and β‐phellandrene (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn32218-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The highest α‐pinene value (15.5%) was obtained by shade‐drying, however, the α‐pinene amount reached its lowest level (t) when microwave and oven‐drying were employed. In addition, both sun‐ and freeze‐drying reduced α‐pinene amount (51.61 and 30.32%, respectively) when compared with shade‐drying. The most β‐pinene amount was acquired by shade‐ (5.0%) and freeze‐drying (2.9%) methods, however, the β‐pinene amount significantly reduced when microwave‐drying was used (0.3%). The highest myrcene content was acquired by shade‐ (17.5%) and sun‐drying (15.0%); however, myrcene content significantly reduced when microwave‐drying was used (0.3%) (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn32218-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Both microwave‐ and oven‐drying (80°C) led to a significant decrease in β‐phellandrene values, reaching the least amount (0.3%) in comparison to shade‐drying (2.9%). However, the maximum β‐phellandrene amount (3.8%) was obtained when freeze‐drying was used. The total content of monoterpene hydrocarbons in the shade‐ and oven‐drying EOs (60 and 80°C) were higher than those in the fresh samples. When the drying temperature was enhanced in the microwave and oven, several monoterpene hydrocarbons were lost compared with methods at lower temperatures. Temperature‐sensitive compositions including a‐pinene, β‐pinene, myrcene, and β‐phellandrene, have a greater tendency to water fraction and evaporate with the water during the drying process (Hamrouni‐Sellami et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32218-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Hazrati et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32218-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Rahimmalek &amp; Goli, 
 <xref rid="fsn32218-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). In additional, the biological structure of EO‐producing glands is affected by higher temperatures and the epithelial cells are corrugated on each other (Diaz‐Maroto et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32218-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). Drying methods can create a porous structure on the surface of plant materials and help accessibility of solutes, such as EOs, through enhancement of mass transition coefficient during extraction, therefore higher volatile compositions can be obtained than those from fresh samples (Feyzi et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32218-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Our results were not in line with the results of previous research done by Samadi et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn32218-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) and Ghasemi Pirbalouti et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn32218-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) where dried plants of 
 <italic>Dracocephalum kotschyi</italic> and basil landrace, respectively, had lower content of monoterpene hydrocarbons than fresh samples. This may possibly be related to the type and source of the plants, as well as the conditions applied for drying techniques (Shahhoseini et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32218-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Similar to our study, it was found that microwave‐drying significantly decreased hydrocarbon monoterpene compounds (Hazrati et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32218-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Mohammadizad et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32218-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>).
