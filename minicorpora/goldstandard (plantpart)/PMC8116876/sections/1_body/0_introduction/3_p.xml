<p>Drying is the most common method of storing medicinal and aromatic plants and protecting their biochemical compounds (Rahimi &amp; Farrokhi, 
 <xref rid="fsn32218-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Medicinal plants in the postharvest stage are very sensitive to fungal damage, due to their high moisture content. Therefore, in choosing the most appropriate method, the drying moisture should be reduced by 10%–12% (Azizi et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32218-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Brovelli et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32218-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). In recent decades, many studies have been conducted on herb‐drying, and several new methods have been introduced to the field. Studies over the past 20 years have focused on drying methodologies and techniques have been established to increase quality as well as to enhance the efficiency of the drying process (Mahmoudi et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32218-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Thamkaew et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32218-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). The essential oils (EOs) of fresh plants are saved on leaves surfaces and in trichome which are specialized structures (Werker, 
 <xref rid="fsn32218-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>). Integrity of the oil glands in the dried products relies on the shelf life of EOs in dried leaves (Ebadi et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32218-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Jangi et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32218-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Thus, through conserving trichome integrity or reducing the damage to trichomes during drying and the aroma quality of dried herbs yield of EOs should be enhanced (Thamkaew et al.,
