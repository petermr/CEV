<p>This study demonstrates the potential of a set of plant essential oils to selectively enhance or antagonize natural pyrethrins when both are applied in combination. Not only did some of these oils synergize natural pyrethrins-based mortality at 24 h, they also increased its ability to immobilize insects shortly after exposure (knockdown at 1 h). However, not all oils produced synergism, with many producing antagonisms of natural pyrethrins toxicity. In fact, synergism and/or antagonism was highly dose dependent. This study demonstrates the utility of select plant essential oils as leads for the development of future insecticide synergists. Many of the oils identified as synergists of either knockdown or lethality have not been studied before as synergists against 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes. Further, the dose dependence of synergistic/antagonistic interactions demonstrates that the dose of individual agents in insecticidal mixtures should be carefully considered.
