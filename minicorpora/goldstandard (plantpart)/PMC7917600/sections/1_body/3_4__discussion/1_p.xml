<p>Twenty plant essential oils were screened in combination with natural pyrethrins and knockdown at 1 h and mortality at 24 h were determined. Many of the oils used in this study have not been screened previously in combination with natural pyrethrins and/or have not been assessed as synergists on 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> female mosquitoes. Moreover, assessing enhancement of both knockdown and mortality are important considerations in the characterization of novel public health pest control formulations, as both effects may lead to the prevention of host feeding. Norris et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-insects-12-00154" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] proposed that knockdown of intoxicated mosquitoes may lead to higher levels of mortality over time in the field, due to exposure to fungal pathogens, desiccation or starvation through the inability to feed, and increased predation. The present study demonstrated that many plant essential oils not only improve the mortality produced by natural pyrethrins at 24 h, but also improve their speed-of-action.
