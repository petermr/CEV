<p>In contrast to the generally positive effects of essential oils on knockdown by natural pyrethrins, PBO significantly reduced knockdown by this natural insecticide. Norris et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-insects-12-00154" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] showed previously that PBO at both 2 and 10 µg/mosquito could significantly decrease the knockdown produced by select pyrethroids at 1 h post-application, and Kasai et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-insects-12-00154" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] showed that 1 hr pretreatment with PBO significantly decreased the penetration rate of [
 <sup>14</sup>C]-permethrin into 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> females. These findings advise against combining diverse formulation additives simply due to their independent activity. Our study corroborated the earlier findings that PBO significantly slowed the immobilization produced by natural pyrethrins in both the 2 µg and 10 µg/insect applications.
