<p>Topical applications of ethanolic solutions containing natural pyrethrins and/or essential oils were performed using methods similar to those outlined in [
 <xref rid="B6-insects-12-00154" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Concentrations of natural pyrethrins ranged from those producing 10% to 90% mortality to ensure a good fit for probit models and to accurately calculate LD
 <sub>25</sub> and LD
 <sub>50</sub> values. Plant essential oils were applied at either 2 µg/insect or 10 µg/insect alone or in combination with the approximate LD
 <sub>25</sub> of natural pyrethrins. The LD
 <sub>25</sub> (1.6 ng/mosquito) was calculated using a Probit model and given as a discrete dose assuming the weight of female mosquitoes was 2.85 ± 0.08 mg/mosquito (average from five cohorts with SEM). Topical applications were performed by anesthetizing adult female mosquitoes on ice for 5 min, and then placing them on a cold, glass Petri dish to prevent reanimation. A Whatman No. 2 filter paper was used to prevent mosquitoes from coming in contact with excess condensation. A 0.2 µL volume of each treatment was applied to the pronotum of each mosquito using a Hamilton (Reno, NV, USA) repeating applicator with a gastight Hamilton syringe and placed in 470 mL deli paper cups. At least five concentrations were used to obtain LD
 <sub>25</sub> and LD
 <sub>50</sub> values for natural pyrethrins alone or in combination with select oils. Ten mosquitoes were treated for each concentration representing one replicate, and at least three different cohorts of mosquitoes were used for each concentration in an effort to control for biological variability in the mosquitoes produced by the Orlando colony. A cohort was defined as a distinct rearing group (i.e., adult mosquitoes obtained from distinct batches of eggs placed in water to initiate development each week). Controls were performed using the vehicle, ethanol. Tulle fabric, fastened to the cup with a deli cup lid rim (center removed), was used to keep mosquitoes from escaping. Deli cups containing ten treated mosquitoes per concentration per replicate were placed in an incubator for the remainder of the experimental interval and kept at the same temperature and light cycle as during rearing. Knockdown, defined as the inability to fly or maintain normal standing posture, was recorded at 1 h, and mortality was recorded at 24 h. Mortality was defined as no movement, even after gently tapping the cup several times to assess response.
