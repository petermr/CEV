<p>Plant essential oils are now recognized as effective alternatives to synthetic insecticides against a wide variety of pests. Their generally pleasant aroma, relatively low toxicity to humans and pets, and perceived salubrious qualities have given rise to a large increase in research focused on the development of these agents for pest control [

However, despite the benefits of their use, it is erroneous to assume that all products containing plant essential oils and plant extracts act similarly. To truly appreciate their value, it is necessary to examine their toxic/repellent effects in order to identify the most efficacious chemistries that could be included in future arthropod control technologies [
