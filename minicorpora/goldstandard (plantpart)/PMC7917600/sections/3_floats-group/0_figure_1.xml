  <p>Synergism ratios of LD
   <sub>50</sub> values (SR) plotted against co-toxicity factors (CTF) obtained at (
   <bold>A</bold>) 2 µg/insect and (
   <bold>B</bold>) 10 µg/insect, along with linear regression analysis. Strong linear correlation value was observed for the 2 µg/insect (Pearson’s correlation coefficient r = 0.94), whereas at 10 µg/insect moderate linear correlation was observed (Pearson’s correlation coefficient r = 0.64).
