  <italic>Zanthoxylum rhetsa</italic> has been consumed in the diet in northern Thailand and also used as a medicament in ancient scripture for arthropathies. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the activity of various extracts from differential parts of 
  <italic>Z. rhetsa</italic> via inhibition of inflammatory mediators (NO, TNF-
  <italic>α</italic>, and PGE
  <sub>2</sub>) in RAW264.7 macrophages. The chemical composition in active extracts was also analyzed by GC/MS. The parts of this plant studied were whole fruits (F), pericarp (P), and seed (O). The methods of extraction included maceration in hexane, 95% ethanol and 50% ethanol, boiling in water, and water distillation. The results demonstrated that the hexane and 95% ethanolic extract from pericarp (PH and P95) and seed essential oil (SO) were the most active extracts. PH and P95 gave the highest inhibition of NO production with IC
  <sub>50</sub> as 11.99 ± 1.66 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/ml and 15.33 ± 1.05 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, respectively, and they also showed the highest anti-inflammatory effect on TNF-
  <italic>α</italic> with IC
  <sub>50</sub> as 36.08 ± 0.55 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/ml and 34.90 ± 2.58 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, respectively. PH and P95 also showed the highest inhibitory effect on PGE
  <sub>2</sub> but less than SO with IC
  <sub>50</sub> as 13.72 ± 0.81 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, 12.26 ± 0.71 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, and 8.61 ± 2.23 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, respectively. 2,3-Pinanediol was the major anti-inflammatory compound analyzed in PH (11.28%) and P95 (19.82%) while terpinen-4-ol constituted a major anti-inflammatory compound in SO at 35.13%. These findings are the first supportive data for ethnomedical use for analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity in acute (SO) and chronic (PH and P95) inflammation.
