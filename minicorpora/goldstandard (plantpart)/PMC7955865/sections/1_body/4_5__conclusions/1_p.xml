<p>PH, P95, and SO of 
 <italic>Z. rhetsa</italic> exerted pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory activity through inhibition of inflammatory mediators via LPS-induced NO, TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, and PGE
 <sub>2</sub> in RAW264.7 macrophages. Our study suggests that the PH and P95 extract fractions analyzed could provide constituents suitable for pain relief in chronic inflammation due to their activity on NO and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> and SO inhibitory effect on PGE
 <sub>2</sub> production. Moreover, PH, P95, and SO contained terpinen-4-ol that was previously reported as an inhibitor of LPS-induced PGE
 <sub>2</sub> and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>. Other components in SO, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, and limonene have previously been reported for their in vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory activity. Therefore, SO may have potential for the development into an analgesic and anti-inflammatory product for inflammation, and its active constituents should be further refine or studied further with additional reference standards where possible. A main active constituent determined in PH and P95 which enables inhibition of NO, TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, and PGE
 <sub>2</sub> appears to be 2,3-pinanediol which comprises almost 20% of P95. These findings are the first foundational supportive data for ethnomedical use as anti-inflammatory and analgesic herbal medicine treatment. 
 <italic>Z. rhetsa</italic> pericarp that is macerated with hexane and 95% ethanol and seed essential oil are now being studied for analgesic product development in ongoing studies in our laboratories.
