<p>Though the previous study was done on whole fruit, our study has shown that 
 <italic>Z. rhetsa</italic> pericarp and seed could perform the same pharmacological functions. This is an important finding since it would be the preparation of this herbal medicine from pericarp or seed not only whole fruit. Although the percentage yields of SO was less (0.27%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), the preparation of the distillation of the seed should be studied further in order to increase its yield. The present study also showed the highest %inhibition of PGE
 <sub>2</sub> production of SO at 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml (83.70% ± 0.22) which was not significantly different from prednisolone at 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml (93.20% ± 3.80) while PH and P95 at 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml showed the highest %inhibition of PGE
 <sub>2</sub> production (71.83% ± 7.51 and 67.44% ± 2.53, respectively) which was significantly different (
 <italic>p</italic> value &lt; 0.001) from prednisolone (

 <sub>50</sub> values of PH and P95 were not significantly different from SO (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Our result was indicated; the preparation of analgesic and anti-inflammatory agents in acute inflammation from PH, P95, and SO was apparent. Whereas percentage yields of PH (5.89%) and P95 (13.10%) were higher than SO (0.27%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Our study is also the first report on anti-inflammatory activity of PH, P95, and SO from 
 <italic>Z. rhetsa</italic> by the inhibition of PGE
 <sub>2</sub> production in RAW 264.7 macrophages.
