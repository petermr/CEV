<p>After cell and tissue damage, the body perceives pain. An acute inflammatory mechanism is induced by inflammatory mediators. PGE
 <sub>2</sub> is the one of chemical mediators: histamine, substance P, bradykinin, acetylcholine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins, resulting in heat, redness, swelling, and nociception. PGE
 <sub>2</sub>-induced vasodilation in the first step of acute inflammatory mechanism leads to increase microvascular permeability and induces pain by acting on peripheral sensory neurons [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The inhibition of PGE
 <sub>2</sub> production can be effective to reduce heat, redness, edema, and pain. In the present study, PH, P95, and SO of 
 <italic>Z. rhetsa</italic> were the most potent groups (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &lt; 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) which showed the greatest potency of LPS-induced PGE
 <sub>2</sub> production in RAW264.7 macrophages, while PO was the second most potent group (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &lt; 30 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml); P50, FO, and F95 was in the third group for potency (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &lt; 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml), and other extracts of 
 <italic>Z. rhetsa</italic> were weak to inactive (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml). These results indicate that whole 
 <italic>Z. rhetsa</italic> fruit should be separated into pericarp and seed, and the inhibitory effect of PGE
 <sub>2</sub> production is higher as a consequence. A previous study reported that an ethanolic extract from 
 <italic>Z. rhetsa</italic> fruit (consisting of pericarp and seed) could inhibit COX-1 (90.80%) and COX-2 (94.40%) [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. PGE
 <sub>2</sub> is one of the products derived from cyclooxygenase pathway [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; therefore, PH, P95, and SO may reduce acute pain from an acute inflammatory mechanism through inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 as well as the eicosanoid product PGE
 <sub>2</sub>. Additionally, an 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study on a bioadhesive gel containing essential oil from the fruit could inhibit licking behavior, edema, and redness of the buccal cavity in rats [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] which was also due to reduced PGE
 <sub>2</sub> in acute inflammation. In clinical trials, a massage oil containing essential oil from fruit relieved pain in the calf muscle compared with carrier oil (placebo) in healthy volunteers after induction by standing and heel raise [
