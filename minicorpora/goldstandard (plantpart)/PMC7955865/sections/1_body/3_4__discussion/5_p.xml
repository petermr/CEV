<p>PH and P95 also demonstrated the highest potency in the inhibition of NO production, which is a free radical synthesized by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) from macrophages with L-arginine as a precursor [

 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Therefore, PH and P95 could protect cells and tissues from injury due to NO. Our results also demonstrated the highest potency on the % inhibition of NO production by PH (97.15% ± 0.37) and P95 (97.66% ± 1.12) at 50

 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml gave the highest %inhibition of NO production (91.55% ± 3.04 and 93.36% ± 3.23, respectively) which were not significantly different from prednisolone (96.82% ± 0.34) at 50
