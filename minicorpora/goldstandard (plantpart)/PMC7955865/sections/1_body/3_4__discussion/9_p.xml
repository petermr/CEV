<p>Some compounds analyzed in the active extracts, PH, P95, and SO (
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), had previously been reported to inhibit inflammatory mediators. Terpinen-4-ol was found in both PH (1.07%), P95 (3.38%), and SO (35.13%), and previous studies reported that terpinen-4-ol could inhibit TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, and PGE
 <sub>2</sub> production by LPS-activated human blood monocytes [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The second most abundant compounds in SO, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (10.95%), has previously been demonstrated to exhibit analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties in mice [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Cuminaldehyde (5.60%) competitively inhibited the activity of 15-lipoxygenase, an enzyme involved in the production of inflammatory mediators such as leukotrienes, using lipoxygenase inhibition assay [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Limonene (5.48%) was found to be in the top five compounds of SO and also previously shown to suppress the production of LPS-induced NO, PGE
 <sub>2</sub>, TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, and IL-6 [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The occurrence of these compounds in SO was the reasons for its in vitro activities. The compounds in PH and P95, spathulenol (6.65% and 4.39%, respectively) and caryophyllene oxide (7.50% and 3.66%, respectively), previously showed that they could inhibit the production of NO, IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, and IL-6 [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The major component in PH and P95 was found to be bicyclo(3.1.1)heptane-2,3-diol, 2,6,6-trimethyl or 2,3-pinanediol (11.28% and 19.82%). This compound was earlier reported as an agent that increased microcirculation when applied topically [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]; thus, 2,3-pinanediol could contribute to pain relief when applied in PH and P95 on inflamed areas [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].
