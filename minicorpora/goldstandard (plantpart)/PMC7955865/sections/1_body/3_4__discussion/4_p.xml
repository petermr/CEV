<p>TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> is an inflammatory cytokine which releases in both acute and chronic inflammation; TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> induces pain and fever and plays a role in rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus [

 <italic>Z. rhetsa</italic> was able to demonstrate the anti-inflammatory action in joints. 
 <italic>Z. rhetsa</italic> fruit is used as an oil (named Pa-Ra-Ti-Tri) and ointment (named Bee-Pra-Sen) for treatment of muscle and joint inflammation in Thai ancient scripture (named Pra-O-Sod-Pra-Na-Rai) [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Additionally, our extracts were effective on TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> production by PH and P95, whereas SO was less active. Therefore, PH and P95 may relieve pain and inflammation via inhibition of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> production. Our findings could be utilized to improve ethnomedicine use by developing a topical analgesic remedy from PH or P95 which demonstrates clinical utility.
