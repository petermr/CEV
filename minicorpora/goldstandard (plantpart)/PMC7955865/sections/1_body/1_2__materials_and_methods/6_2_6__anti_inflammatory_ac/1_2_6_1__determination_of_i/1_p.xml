<p>The determination of inhibitory effect of LPS-induced NO production was done in triplicate following the protocol of an established method [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Briefly, 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/well of RAW 264.7 macrophages (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) were seeded in sterilized 96 well-plate and incubated for 24 h, and then the medium was removed and replaced with 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/well of fresh medium containing LPS (2 ng/ml of final concentration). Various dilutions of samples were added (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/well) and incubated for another 24 h. Subsequently, a 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/well of supernatant was transferred into a nonsterilized 96 well-plate and added with Griess reagent (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/well). The absorbance of the mixed solution was measured by microplate reader at 570 nm. The result of the tested sample was compared with that of prednisolone, a positive control. The percentage of the inhibition of LPS-induced NO production was calculated by using the following equation, and IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated by using GraphPad Prism software (CA, USA):
