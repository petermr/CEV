<p>The chemical compositions of the active extracts were analyzed by using a Thermo Focus GC, Polaris 
 <italic>Q</italic> with an autoinjector and a capillary column TG-5 slims (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>m) (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Column oven temperature was programmed using the initial temperature at 60°C and 5 min initial time and then heated at the rate of 5°C/min to 300°C and held for 5 min. The injector temperature was 200°C, helium (He) was used as the carrier gas with constant flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, and the injection volume was 2 
 <italic>μ</italic>l (splitting ratio 1 : 50). The ionization energy was 70 eV. Mass spectrum of the GC/MS peak was detected by mass spectrometry and compared with library database of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST 08, MD, USA) which matches the score for all compounds analyzed more than 870 would be selected [
