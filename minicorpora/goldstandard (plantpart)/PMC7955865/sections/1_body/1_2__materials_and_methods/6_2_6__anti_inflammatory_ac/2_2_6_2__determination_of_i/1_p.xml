<p>The inhibition of LPS-induced TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> production was determined by using Mouse TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> Quantikine ELISA test kit following the procedure in the manufacturer's manual [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Briefly, RAW 264.7 macrophages (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) were seeded in sterilized 96 well-plate (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/well) and incubated for 24 h; then, the medium was removed and replaced with 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/well of fresh medium containing LPS at 2 ng/ml final concentration. Various dilutions of samples were added (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/well) and incubated for another 24 h. After incubation, the supernatant (50 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/well) was transferred into 96 well-plate of ELISA kit and it was carried out according to the method in the manufacturer's manual [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm by using the microplate reader. The result of the tested sample was compared with that of prednisolone, a positive control. The experiment was conducted in triplicate. The percentage of the inhibition of LPS-induced TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> production was calculated by using the following equation, and IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated by using GraphPad Prism software (CA, USA):
