<p>The inhibition of LPS-induced PGE
 <sub>2</sub> production was determined by using prostaglandin 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> ELISA Kit-Monoclonal following the procedure in the manufacturer's manual [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Briefly, RAW 264.7 macrophages (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) were seeded in sterilized 96 well-plate (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/well) and incubated for 24 h, and then the medium was removed and replaced with 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/well of fresh medium containing LPS at 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml final concentration. Various dilutions of samples were added (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/well) and incubated for another 24 h. After incubation, the supernatant (50 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/well) was transferred into 96 well-plate of ELISA kit and the procedure carried out according to the method in the manufacturer's manual [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The absorbance was measured at 412 nm by using the microplate reader. The result of tested sample was compared with that of prednisolone, a positive control. The experiment was conducted in triplicate. The percentage of the inhibition of LPS-induced PGE
 <sub>2</sub> production was calculated by using the following equation, and IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated by using GraphPad Prism software (CA, USA):
