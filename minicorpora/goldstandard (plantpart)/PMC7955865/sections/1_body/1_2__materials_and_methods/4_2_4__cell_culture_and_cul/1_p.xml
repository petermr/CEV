<p>RAW 264.7 macrophages from mouse (
 <italic>Mus musculus</italic>) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC®TIB-71) (USA). Cells were cultured in two types of media according to assays: (1) RPMI 1640 medium for the assays of inhibition of LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) and tumor necrosis factor-
 <italic>α</italic> (TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>) production following the established method [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and the procedure in the manufacturer's manual [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], respectively, and (2) DMEM medium for the assay of inhibition of LPS-induced prostaglandin 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> (PGE
 <sub>2</sub>) production following the method of the procedure in the manufacturer's manual [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Each medium was supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% P/S (100 unit/ml) and incubated in an incubator at 37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, and 95% humidity.
