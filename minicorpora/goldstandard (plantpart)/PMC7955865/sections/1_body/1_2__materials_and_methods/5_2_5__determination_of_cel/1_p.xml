<p>Cell viability was done in triplicate by using MTT assay [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Briefly, after 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well of RAW 264.7 macrophages were seeded in sterilized 96 well-plate (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/well) and incubated for 24 h, the medium was removed and replaced with 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/well of fresh medium. Various dilutions of samples were added (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/well) and incubated for another 24 h. Subsequently, the supernatants (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/well) were removed, and the viable cells were determined by adding 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/well of the MTT solution (5 mg/ml) and further incubated for 2 h. The medium was then removed and replaced with 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/well of isopropanol containing 0.04 M HCl to dissolve formazan in the cells. The absorbance was measured by microplate reader at 570 nm. Cell viability that was higher than 70% compared with control (control medium for water extracts and control solvent: 0.2% DMSO of final concentration for crude extracts, essential oils, and prednisolone) indicated that the activity of the tested samples was not due to cytotoxicity [
