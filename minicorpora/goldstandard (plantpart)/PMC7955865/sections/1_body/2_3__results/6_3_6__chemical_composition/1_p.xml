<p>PH and P95 showed the highest production inhibition of LPS-induced NO, TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, and PGE
 <sub>2</sub> while SO showed the highest production inhibition of LPS-induced PGE
 <sub>2</sub>. Therefore, PH, P95, and SO compositions were analyzed by GC/MS (
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) and presented GC/MS chromatogram of PH (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(a)</xref>), P95 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(b)</xref>), and SO (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(c)</xref>). PH and P95 contained some chemical compounds as in SO; these were 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene (0.68%, 0.79%, and 4.91%, respectively), terpinen-4-ol (1.07%, 3.38%, and 35.13%, respectively), and terpinenyl acetate (1.57%, 1.62%, and 6.65%, respectively). PH and P95 shared similar composition but different in percentages. Bicyclo(3.1.1)heptane-2,3-diol,2,6,6-trimethyl or 2,3-pinanediol (11.28%), neryl acetate (7.65%), caryophyllene oxide (7.50%), spathulenol (6.65%), and cetanol (3.78%) are constituents in top 5 of PH. Bicyclo(3.1.1)heptane-2,3-diol,2,6,6-trimethyl or 2,3-pinanediol (19.82%), 2,3-camphanediol (5.87%), durenol (4.53%), piperitone oxide (4.46%), and spathulenol (4.39%) are in top 5 constituents of P95. Terpinen-4-ol was the major compound (35.13%) in SO; the next top 5 compounds were 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (10.95%), terpinenyl acetate (6.65%), cuminol (5.60%), and limonene (5.48%).
