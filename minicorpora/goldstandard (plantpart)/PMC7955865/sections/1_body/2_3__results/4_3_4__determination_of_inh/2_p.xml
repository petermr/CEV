<p>The results of IC
 <sub>50</sub> on inhibitory effect of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> production are shown in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The pericarp which was macerated in hexane and 95% ethanol maintained inhibitory effects of NO production. PH and P95 were 36.08 ± 0.55 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml and 34.90 ± 2.58 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, respectively, but were significantly different (
 <italic>p</italic> value &lt; 0.001) from prednisolone (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.08 ± 0.003 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml or 0.22 ± 0.003 
 <italic>μ</italic>M). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> of SO (49.85 ± 4.29 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) was significantly different (
 <italic>p</italic> value &lt; 0.05) from PH and P95. All water extracts (PW, FW and SW) and all extracts of the seed (except for the essential oil of the seed: SO) did not have the activity on LPS-induced TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> production inhibition (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml).
