<p>The results on inhibitory effect on PGE
 <sub>2</sub> production are shown in IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>); SO exhibited the highest anti-inflammatory effect on PGE
 <sub>2</sub> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> as 8.61 ± 2.23 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml and was significantly different (
 <italic>p</italic> value &lt; 0.05) from prednisolone (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.07 ± 0.003 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml or 0.19 ± 0.003 
 <italic>μ</italic>M). The inhibitory effect on PGE2 production of PH and P95 (IC50 = 13.72 ± 0.8 and 12.26 ± 0.71 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) were not significantly different with SO but they were significantly different with prednisolone. However, its pericarp demonstrated higher anti-inflammatory activity on the inhibitory effect of PGE
 <sub>2</sub> production than whole fruit and seed accept only seed oil (SO). All water extracts (PW, FW, and SW) and all extracts of the seed (except the essential oil of the seed: SO) did not have the activity on LPS-induced TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> production inhibition (IC

 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml).
