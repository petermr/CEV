<p>The extract results showed that PH and P95 had an inhibitory effect on NO production with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values as 11.99 ± 1.66 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml and 15.33 ± 1.05 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, respectively. They were significantly different (
 <italic>p</italic> value &lt; 0.01 and 
 <italic>p</italic> value &lt; 0.001, respectively) from prednisolone (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.07 ± 0.001 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml or 0.19 ± 0.001 
 <italic>μ</italic>M). However, the pericarp was macerated in hexane and 95% ethanol. The results demonstrated with the whole fruits macerated in hexane and 95% ethanol showed higher activity than decoction in water and maceration in 50% ethanol. For seeds which underwent water distillation, significant anti-inflamatory activity on NO production was demonstrated compared to other extraction means. The method of extraction revealed the most activity in the pericarp on the inhibition of NO production which was demonstrated with maceration in 95% ethanol and hexane. All water extracts (PW, FW, and SW), the essential oil of both percarp (PO) and fruits (FO), and the hexane extract of seed (SH) were not active (IC
