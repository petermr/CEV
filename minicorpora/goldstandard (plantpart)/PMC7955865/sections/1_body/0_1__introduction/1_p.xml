<p>Pain is a common symptom and sign of inflammation and tissue damage [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Etiology including physical, biological, and chemical factors such as trauma, overuse, chemical, toxins, and pathogens can activate inflammatory response [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Inflammation is a response to protect and restore cells and tissues to a normal state [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The stimulus activates leukocytes to produce inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-
 <italic>α</italic> (TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In a site of tissue injury, prostaglandin 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> (PGE
 <sub>2</sub>) plays an important role in acute inflammation and causes vasodilation edema, acute pain, and fever [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> is an inflammatory cytokine that is intertwined with PGE
 <sub>2</sub> as it stimulates phospholipase 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> and releases eicosanoids from the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways in arachidonic acid metabolism [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The important product from cyclooxygenase is PGE
 <sub>2</sub> [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Additionally, high levels of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> can trigger fever and activate endothelial cells to express adhesion molecules resulting in leukocytes adherence and prolonged inflammation [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Macrophages trigger production of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> cytokines causing pain and fever, loss of cell function, or loss of mobility in joints [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> can also activate macrophages to produce nitric oxide (NO) [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. NO is a free radical derived from L-arginine and oxygen by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) enzyme from macrophages [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. NO induces toxicity by interaction with superoxide and produces peroxynitrite which is highly toxic to microorganisms and normal neighboring cells [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Cells and tissues are gradually destroyed by excessive NO production, and as a result, the perception of pain remains.
