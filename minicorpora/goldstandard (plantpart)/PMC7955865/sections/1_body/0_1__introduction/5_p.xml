<p>Therefore, the present study compared and investigated the anti-inflammatory activity of various anatomical parts such as whole fruits, pericarp, and seed of 
 <italic>Z. rhetsa</italic> extracts through the inhibition of lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced NO, TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, and PGE
 <sub>2</sub> in RAW264.7 macrophages. Additionally, chemical compositions of the active extracts were also delineated as anti-inflammatory, and pain relief activity of 
 <italic>Z. rhetsa</italic> has been poorly studied [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Furthermore, the analysis of chemical constituents in pericarp, fruit, and seed of 
 <italic>Z. rhetsa</italic> of various extractions and characterizing the anti-inflammatory activity has not been undertaken [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>–
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].
