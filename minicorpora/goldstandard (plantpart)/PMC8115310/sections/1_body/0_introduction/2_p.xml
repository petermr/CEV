 <italic>O. cufodontii</italic>. Hence, in view of the attributed medicinal significance of the plant and its availability as an indigenous resource, the present work was undertaken to explore the chemical constituents and some biological activities of the leaves and roots of 
 <italic>O. cufodontii</italic>. Therefore, this paper describes for the first time the molecular docking analysis, antibacterial, and antioxidant activities of the extracts and constituents of the leaves and roots of 
 <italic>O. cufodontii</italic>.
