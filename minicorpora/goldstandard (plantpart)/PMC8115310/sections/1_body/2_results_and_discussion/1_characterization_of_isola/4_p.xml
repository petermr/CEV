<p id="Par21">Compound 
 <bold>3</bold> (38 mg) was isolated as a red crystals melted at 85–86 °C. The MS spectrum revealed the molecular ion peak at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 330.2 [M−H] 
 <sup>+</sup> attributed to the molecular formula C
 <sub>19</sub>H
 <sub>25</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>N. The UV–Vis spectrum (Methanol) showed absorption maxima at 340 and 540 nm, indicating the presence of conjugated chromophore in the structure. The 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectrum (400 MHz, CDCl
 <sub>3</sub>) showed signals due to four methyls at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 1.12 (6H, 
 <italic>d</italic>, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 6.94 Hz, H-5″, 6′) and 
 <italic>δ</italic> 1.08 (6H, 
 <italic>d</italic>, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 6.77 Hz, H-6′, 7′). Another methyl group is observed at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 2.32 (3H, 
 <italic>s</italic>, H-6a). The signals due to two methylene protons were apparent at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 3.12 (2H, 
 <italic>t</italic>, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 6.84, H-1″) and 
 <italic>δ</italic> 2.67 (2H, 
 <italic>t</italic>, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 6.84, H-2″). Signals due to three olefinic protons were evident at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 7.07 (1H, 
 <italic>s</italic>, H-3′), 7. 04 (1H, 
 <italic>d, J</italic> = 8.42 Hz, H-3), and 7.35 (1H, 
 <italic>d</italic>, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 8.42 Hz, H-4). The 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectrum (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) together with DEPT-135 NMR spectrum revealed the presence of seven quaternary, five methine, two methylene, and five methyl groups. The presence of three carbonyls are also evident at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 213.6 (C-3″), 181.2 (C-1′) and 182.3 (C-4′). The two methylenes were observed at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 24.9 (C-1″) and 
 <italic>δ</italic> 38.5 (C-2″). The spectrum also displayed signals due to quaternary carbons at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 147.0 (C-2), 144.7 (C-6), 134.9 (C-2′), and 
 <italic>δ</italic> 128.4 (C-5). The signal due to two methine group on aromatic ring were evident at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 128.5 (C-3) and 
 <italic>δ</italic> 137.0 (C-4). The data generated enable us to propose the structure of compound 
 <bold>3</bold> as shown in Fig.
