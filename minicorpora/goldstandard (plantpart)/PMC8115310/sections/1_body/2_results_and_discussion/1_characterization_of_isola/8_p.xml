 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectrum with the aid of DEPT-135 revealed the presence of seven quaternary, five methine, three methylene, and five methyl groups. The spectrum (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) revealed the presence of two carbonyl carbons at 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>C</sub> 210.5 (C-3′) and 203.5 (C-2″). The three methylene groups are apparent at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 40.3 (C-2′), 22.0 (C-1′) and 29.7 (C-1″). The sp2 quaternary carbons at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 140.5, 138.3, 137.9 and 121.1 were attributed to C-2, C-8a, C-6 and C-8, respectively. The other oxygenated sp3 quaternary carbon appeared at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 81.9 (C-3″). Two methine carbons are also evident at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 27.3 (C-4′) and 55.7 (C-3). The data generated led us to the identification of compound
