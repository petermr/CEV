<p id="Par33">The lipid peroxidation inhibitory potential of the extracts and isolated compounds were assessed using ferricthiocyante methods with the results presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>. As observed from Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, the hexane extracts of the leaves and the roots inhibited peroxide formation by 70.01 and 83.02%, respectively. The activity displayed by the latter extract is better than the activity displayed by the isolated compounds. The activity displayed by the hexane extract of the roots of 
 <italic>O. cufodontii</italic> is comparable with the standard drug demonstrating the lipid peroxidation inhibitory potential of the hexane extract. This indicates the potential use of the extracts of the leaves and roots of 
 <italic>O. cufodontii</italic> as remedy against diseases caused by radicals.
