<p id="Par36">Compounds with antimicrobial activities disable bacteria by targeting key components of bacterial metabolism including cell-walls, DNA-directed RNApolymerase, protein synthesis, enzymes and DNAgyrase. The latter controls the topology of DNAduring transcription and replication by introducing transient breaks to both DNA strands

 </sup>. Since DNAgyrase is pivotal for bacterial survival, it is essential to exploits bacterial DNAgyrase as a key target of antibacterial agent

 </sup>. In view of this, the molecular docking study was carried out to examine the binding interactions of isolated compounds with the pocket of DNAgyrase and compared with ciprofloxacin. All the synthesized compounds exhibited well established bonds with one or more amino acids in the active pocket of the enzyme. The compounds also displayed minimum binding energy ranging from − 6.1 to − 6.9 kcal/mol (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>) with compound 
 <bold>3</bold> shown to have comparable binding score and amino acid interactions compared to ciprofloxacin. The binding affinity of the synthetic compounds along with their bonding interactions of ligands (
 <bold>1–5</bold>) were summarized in Table
