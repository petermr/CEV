<p id="Par4">Melting points of the isolated compounds were done using melting point apparatus (BUCHI, Germany). Analytical TLC was run on a 0.25 mm thick layer of silica gel GF254 (Merck) on aluminium plate. Detection of spots on TLC was done either by spraying with vanillin or by observation under UV lamp. Purification of compounds was done using column chromatography over silica gel (230–400 mesh). The UV and NMR spectra were measured using UV–Vis spectrophotometer (PG instruments, UK) and Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer operating at 400 MHz, respectively. Mass spectra were run on a JMS HX-110 double focussing mass spectrophotometer, using MeOH as a solvent and glycerol as a matrix on the target. Samples were ionized by bombardment with xenon (gas) atom. Methanol (99.99% GC grade, United Kingdom), 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane (99% Ranchem industry and trading), Ethyl acetate (98% UNI-CHEM chemical reagents), Ethanol (100% GC grade Mumbai, India) and DPPH (Sigma) were purchased from Addis Ababa (NEWAY PLC, chemicals).
