 </sup>. The FRAP reagent was prepared by mixing acetate buffer (25 mL, 0.3 M), TPTZ (2,4,6-tripyridyl-s-triazine) solution (2.5 mL), and FeCl
 <sub>3</sub>∙6H
 <sub>2</sub>O solution (2.5 mL), and then heated to 37 °C before use. A properly diluted sample (0.1 mL, 100 µg/mL) was mixed with FRAP reagent (4.0 mL) to form a mixture. This was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in the dark, and the absorbance was measured at 593 nm against a blank (distilled water). The results were expressed as aqueous solution of ferrous sulfate (FeSO
 <sub>4</sub>∙7H
 <sub>2</sub>O), and derived from a calibration curve of the standards. Likewise, the FRAP value of ascorbic acid was obtained by the same procedure.
