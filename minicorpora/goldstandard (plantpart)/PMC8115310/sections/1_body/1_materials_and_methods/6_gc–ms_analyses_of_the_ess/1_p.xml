 </sup>. A GC–MS instrument from Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a 6890 N network GC system, 5975 inert mass selective detector, 7683B series auto sampler injector (10 μL in size), G1701DA GC/MSD Chem Station and HP5MS column (30 m length × 0.25 mm internal diameter × 0.25 μm film thickness) coated with 5% phenyl 95% methyl poly siloxane was used for analyzing the samples. 2 μL essential oil solutions in chloroform was injected through auto sampler and analyzed with HP5MS column. Column temperature was programed as follows: 55–120 °C at 20 °C/min, 120–150 °C at 1.5 °C/min, 150–250 °C at 20 °C/min, 250 °C (10 min) and 3 min solvent delay. The mass spectra transfer line temperature was 280 °C. The carrier gas was helium (1 mL/min) with a split ratio equal to 100:1. The mass spectra were recorded in electron ionization mode at 70 eV with scanning from 50 to 500 amu (atomic mass unit) at 0.5 s with the mass source being set at 230 °C. The relative % amount of each component was calculated by comparing its average peak area to the total area Identification of the constituents was done with the aid of NIST 2005 library of mass spectra.
