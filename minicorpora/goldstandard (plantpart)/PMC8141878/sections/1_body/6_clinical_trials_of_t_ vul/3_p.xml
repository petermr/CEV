<p id="p0260">In another trial, which was focused on the amelioration effects of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. on dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation in females), essential oil (25 drops) was investigated for its pain relieving properties [

 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. essential oil. Pain intensity mean values reached the lowest point (6.57–1.14) in case of oil consumers’ group in comparison with that of the placebo (6.13–3.45) and ibuprofen (5.3–1.48) (p &lt; 0.05). However, no significant results were obtained in case of bleeding control by both oil and placebo (Ibuprofen 200mg + oil 25 drops). In addition, the oil was able to reduce clinical symptoms like lower abdominal pain, nausea, mood swing, and fatigue after 48 h of consumption (p &lt; 0.05). Around 71.4% of the volunteers marked 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. oil as excellent whereas ibuprofen (28.0%) and placebo (14.3) were found to be underscored. Here, anti-prostaglandin and antispasmodic activity of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. was attributed [
