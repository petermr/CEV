<p id="p0110">Flavones like 6-hydroxyluteolin, apigenin, luteolin, methyl-flavones including cirsimaritin or genkwanin, cirsilineol, 5-desmethylnobiletin, 8-methoxycirsilineol, 7-methoxyluteolin, gardenin B, salvigenin, thymonin, sideritoflavone, xanthomicrol and thymusin [
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. There have been no reports on pharmacological activities of these compounds except apigenin, luteolin, cirsimaritin, genkwanin, and xanthomicrol. Studies need to focus on the extraction and biosynthesis of individual compounds which can further become a basis for phytomedicines. Although only a few of the flavonoids are reported (
