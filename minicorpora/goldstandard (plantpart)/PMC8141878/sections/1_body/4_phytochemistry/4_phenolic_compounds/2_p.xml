 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. is one of the principal sources of phenolic compounds. Heidari et al. (2018) identified new phenolic compounds using GC-MS technique, in which a few of the phenolic compounds were already reported. They include creosol 2-Methoxy-4-methylphenol), thiophenol (benzenethiol), quininic acid (6-methoxyquinoline-4-carboxylic acid), loliolide [(6S,7aR)-6-hydroxy-4,4,7a-trimethyl-6,7-dihydro-5H-1-benzofuran-2-one], phenol 4-(3- hydroxy-1- propenyl-2- methoxy), and 3-Methoxy-5- methylphenol [
