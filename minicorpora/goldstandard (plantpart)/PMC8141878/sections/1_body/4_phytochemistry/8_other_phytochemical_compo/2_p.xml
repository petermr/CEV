<p id="p0120">Banerjee et al. (2019) assessed polysaccharide content using aqueous extraction of the alcohol insoluble residue of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. leaf and reported the presence of four types of polysaccharides. They include homogalacturonan, starch, cellulose and a unique type of polysaccharide known as rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I). They also reported the association of RG-I with ester linked phenolic acids shows profound antioxidant activity [

 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L.. Identification of the other biomolecules like proteins and vitamins using the whole plant extracts could lead to the elucidation of nutritive profiling of the plant.
