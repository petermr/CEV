<p id="p0105">Characterization of the essential oil of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. reveals a list of hydrocarbons, oxides, alcohols/esters, and aldehydes/ketones. Many of the studies have reported the uses of a variable number of compounds with different concentrations. Among all the reported volatile compounds, thymol, carvacrol, geraniol, linalool, α- and β-pinene, p-cymene, and γ-terpinene have been reported with major pharmacological activities [

In addition, hydrocarbons like 2,6-Octadienal, cis-Sabinene hydrate, germacrene D, limonene, β-ocimene, myrcene, β-caryophyllene, α-thujene, α-phellandrene and α-humulene are present. Oxides like 1,8-cineol, caryophyllene oxide; alcohol/esters including α-terpineol, borneol, 1-octen-3-ol, 3-octanol, p-cymen-8-ol, terpinen-4-ol, thymol methyl ether, carvacrol methyl ether; aldehydes/ketones like 3-octanone, camphor, thymoquinone, and geranial are present. The GC-MS analysis also showed the presence of esters including butanoic acid, 2-methyl-, methyl ester, bornyl acetate, and geranyl propanoate. The majority of these compounds need to be assessed individually to decipher their pharmacological potential [
