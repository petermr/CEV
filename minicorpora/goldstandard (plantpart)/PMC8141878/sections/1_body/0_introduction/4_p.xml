<p id="p0020">These initial findings prevail the significant therapeutic potential of the plant with respect to pharmacological properties, which may be the results of its active components. In recent years, 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. has been the centre of research interest and colossal amount literature is already available. Although a few small reviews have been carried out on limited aspects of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. [
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], no comprehensive review has been published till date including details of the potential therapeutic aspects. Therefore, we deliberate on summing up the present and up-to-date information with respect to chemical composition, ethnopharmacology, pharmacology, and toxicology of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. We also aim to document a few uncommon pharmacological activities that can completely change the present perspectives on the plant.
