 <italic>T.Â vulgaris</italic> L. powder to mammary carcinoma rat and 4T1 mouse models led to a remarkable reduction in the volume of 4T1 tumours by 85% at 1% concentration. In the rat model, the same concentration decreased the tumour frequency by 53% compared with that of the control, besides suppressing the genes associated with tumour inducing properties. This property is attributed to the resultant upregulation of caspase-2 and caspase-3 enzymes, along with bcl-2 and Bax proteins that result in cell apoptosis. Results were in accordance with the controls used, and these results were significant (p &lt; 0.05 [
