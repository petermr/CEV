<p id="p0185">Cytotoxic activity of thyme oil was analysed against MCF7 (breast adenocarcinoma), HCT15 (colon carcinoma), HeLa (cervical carcinoma), HepG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma), and NCI-H460 (non-small cell lung cancer) cell lines. 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. oil showedgrowth inhibition for all the cell lines tested at 76.02–180.40 μg/ml concentration (GI
 <sub>50</sub>). However, thyme oil did not show any effect on non-tumour liver PLP cells, even at a high concentration of 400 μg/ml (p &lt; 0.05) [

In a study, H460 lung cancer cell line was found to be sensitive at 0.11% of hydroalcoholic extract (p &lt; 0.05) and downregulated NF-κB p65 and NF-κB p52 proteins along with the reduction of IL-1β and IL-8 gene expression in LPS model. However, there was no cytotoxicity reported within a concentration range of 0.04–0.60% [
