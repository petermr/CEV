<p id="p0200">The selectiveness of thyme oil and other extracts towards tumour cells needs to be studied, for the possible presence of molecular pathways that mediate the anti-cancerous effect. The mechanisms of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. fractions on different cell lines need to be elucidated with respect to biochemical and physiological changes occurring within the proliferating cell. These findings may serve as key sources during drug development process. Most of the studies have attributed the anti-proliferative activity to the monoterpenes, carvacrol and thymol that are predominantly present in thyme oil [

 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. According to Aazza et al. (2014) carvacrol and thymol possess higher anti-cancerous potential than p-cymene and borneol [
 <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Thus, isolation and identification of individual components for anti-cancerous potential needs to be done. Although Deb et al. (2011) have deduced the mechanism of thymol in causing damage to the cancer cell via inducing the activity of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) [
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], much remains unknown about the other compounds. In a new approach, nanoparticles have induced better cell apoptosis compared with that of the plant extract, but with more cytotoxic effect [

Accurate determination of these doses using human cell lines and animal models could be useful to conduct clinical trials for drug development.
