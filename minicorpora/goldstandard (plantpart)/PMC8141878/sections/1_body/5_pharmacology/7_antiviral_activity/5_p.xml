Effect of plant fractions on viral genome and protein synthesis needs to be studied along with the gene expression levels. Using bioinformatic tools like molecular docking to study the binding efficiency of plant-based compounds to viral proteins could be a feasible approach. For example, Feriotto etÂ al. (2018) have deduced the role of TAT/TAR-RNA complex in the virulence of HIV-1. The same complex could be assessed in terms of its interaction with the plant phytochemicals [
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Including HIV-1, diseases like influenza and Herpes are often difficult to identify because they are asymptomatic and have an extended incubation period. Herpes has a substantial effect on skin, which could be evaluated by the application of thyme oil. As the viruses affect targeted organs, an organ-targeted delivery of the modified plant fraction could be studied in a dose-dependent manner.
