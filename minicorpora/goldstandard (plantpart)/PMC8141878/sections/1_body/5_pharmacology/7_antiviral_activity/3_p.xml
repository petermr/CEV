<p id="p0215">Apart from influenza, thyme oil was found to be effective on causative viruses of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) like herpes simplex virus (HSV) and human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). HSV possesses two antigenic types, type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2), resulting in flu like symptoms in humans. Thyme oil along with the major monoterpene compounds α-terpinene, terpinen-4-ol, α-terpineol, α-pinene, p-cymene, thymol, citral and 1,8-cineole were analysed for their antiviral activity. RC-37 kidney cells were used for non-cytotoxic dose determination, which ranged between 20 μg/ml for citral and 1250 μg/ml for 1,8-cineole. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for 1,8-cineole was 1200 μg/ml. Thyme oil proved to reduce the viral load by &gt;96%, whereas all monoterpenes by &gt;80% (p &lt; 0.05) [
