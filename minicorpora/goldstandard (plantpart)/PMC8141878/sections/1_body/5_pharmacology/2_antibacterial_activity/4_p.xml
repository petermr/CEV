<p id="p0135">These studies indicate the antibacterial potential of thyme oil and other extracts on bacteria isolated from various sources. A greater inhibitory activity was observed by the use of thyme oil against bacteria in comparison with that of the aqueous, ethanolic extracts, and even a few antibiotics [

 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Although both bacteriostatic and bactericidal values were discovered, dose-dependent activities need to be conducted using animal models and human cell lines. It is noteworthy that thyme oil has exhibited a significant bacteriostatic activity against MDR and MRSA strains [

 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Though the oil serves as a better antibacterial agent owing to its facile extraction method and significant activity, studies need to focus on individual compounds to assess their effects either in single or in combination. Many of the studies have reported the synthesis as well as extraction of individual compounds present in thyme oil that are proved to have profound antibacterial effects [

 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Further, mechanisms of the bacteriostatic and bactericidal functions of the fractions need to be elucidated with respect to physicochemical and physiological changes in bacterial cell.
