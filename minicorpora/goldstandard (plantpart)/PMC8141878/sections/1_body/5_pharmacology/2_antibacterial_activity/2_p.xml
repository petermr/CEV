 <italic>Cervus elaphus</italic>) including 
 <italic>Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Yersinia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecalis</italic> were found sensitive towards the ethanol extract of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L., where minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was observed as &gt;6.25, 3.12,&gt;6.25, 0.2, 0.39, 0.78 mm respectively at 100 μl concentration (p &lt; 0.05). These bacteria showed mixed response towards antibiotics [

 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. was found to be effective against methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA), where bacteria isolated from the infected mice body parts were tested under 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions. It was found that for the bacteria isolated from throat and lungs, MIC was found to be 2.93 and 3.83 colony forming unit (CFU) (log
 <sub>10</sub>)/ml, respectively (p &lt; 0.05) [

 <italic>Salmonella typhirium</italic>, thyme oil from 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. showed MIC of 25.5 mm at 100 μl concentration, in accordance with amoxicillin (23.0 mm) and cefotaxime (15.0 mm) [

 <italic>Salmonella enteritidis</italic> (48 h) was inhibited by thyme oil at an MIC/MBC of 0.156/0.315 μl/ml, in accordance with that of the control. The oil also reduced the metabolic activity by 9.6–70.5%, where both biofilm and metabolic activity reductions were found to be significant (p &lt; 0.05). The study also included the individual assessment of thymol and carvacrol, whose results were found to be strikingly similar in case of antibacterial assay [
