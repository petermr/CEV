 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. is reported to comprise a few other properties which are yet be focused on. Studies are yet to be conducted to assess the antidiabetic and anti-hyperglycemic activities regarded as the indispensable properties of a medicinal plant. A study by Aljarah and Hameed (2018) depicts the

Out of aqueous, methanol and ethanol extracts at different concentrations (4, 8, 15, and 20 μg/ml), methanol extract resulted in maximum inhibition of α-glucosidase (IC
