<p>The Chios breed of sheep is a relatively high yielding one [

Another crucial aim of this study was to evaluate whether a dietary mixture of cornus extract plus oregano and thyme essential oils could enhance their antioxidant properties, showing synergistic properties in simultaneous administration, as it is presented in the literature [

 <xref rid="B81-animals-11-01063" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], especially during the hot summer period. As a result, diet supplementation with plant extracts and essential oils improved lipid and protein oxidative stability in milk, providing evidence that those animals could better cope with the high ambient temperatures compared to the animals on a normal diet. Moreover, yoghurt and feta cheese made from the milk of animals that were fed the plant extracts presented higher lipid and protein oxidative stability.
