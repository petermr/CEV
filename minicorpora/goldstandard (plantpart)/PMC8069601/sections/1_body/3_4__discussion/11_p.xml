<p>The observed changes in feed utilization and FA concentrations could partly be due to the antioxidative effects of the plant extracts used or to changes in rumen microbial populations. A causal explanation of how EO mixtures affect ruminal fermentation patterns through microorganism modification has not been clearly established. Evans and Martin [
 <xref rid="B87-animals-11-01063" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] examined the effects of thymol on ruminal microorganisms. Thymol, which is a constituent of the EO mixture tested here, inhibited gram-positive bacteria (
 <italic>Streptococcus bovis</italic> at 180 μg of thymol/mL and gram-negative bacteria (
 <italic>Selenomonas ruminantium</italic>)) at 90 μg of thymol/mL. Although these in vitro concentrations are much greater than the theoretically expected concentration of the mixtures tested in our experiment, bacterial inhibition could be a potential cause of the altered values of the fatty acid profiles of milk, yoghurt and cheese observed in the current study, which may be due to differences in fermentation patterns and subsequent biohydrogenation of the unsaturated fatty acids by rumen bacteria.
