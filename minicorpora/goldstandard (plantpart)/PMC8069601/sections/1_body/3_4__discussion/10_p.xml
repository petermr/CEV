<p>A great number of studies referring to the addition of essential oils to milk and milk-derived products acknowledge their beneficial effects. It is generally known that the essential oil of thyme has the potential to inhibit various types of pathogenic microorganisms. The addition of thyme and thyme essential oil leads to an increased yoghurt fermentation time, whereas the counts of lactic acid bacteria finally reach the required minimum value for dairy fermented products [

Another study revealed that the inclusion of thyme, marjoram and sage in yoghurt had a stimulatory effect on the starter culture and the total viable counts and that the titratable acidity was increased in Labneh cheese samples fortified with essential oil. Moreover, thyme essential oils provided a stimulatory effect on the growth of the starter culture of
