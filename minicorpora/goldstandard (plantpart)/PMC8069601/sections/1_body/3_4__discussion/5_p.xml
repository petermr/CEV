<p>In our study, dairy sheep were reared in the hot summer months under semi-temperate climatic conditions. As the mean temperature during the trial period exceeded 28 â„ƒ for several hours per day, the animals may have suffered from heat stress. A study by Braun et al. [
 <xref rid="B68-animals-11-01063" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] suggested that a blend of plant bioactive essential oils can improve feed efficiency along with calcium homeostasis in dairy cows due to the activation of specific cation-transporting proteins, resulting in an increased uptake of cations like calcium and ammonium [

 <xref rid="B70-animals-11-01063" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], that showed no change in milk concentrations of fat, protein and urea N, and the milk concentrations of fat, protein and lactose content in cows fed up to 2 g/d of a supplement containing essential oil compounds such as thymol, eugenol, vanillin, guaiacol and limonene. In our study we took into account the effect of diet, season and farm management along with parity, BW and stage of lactation in order to avoid confounding the effects of specific plant extracts on milk production and milk quality, as was correctly described [
