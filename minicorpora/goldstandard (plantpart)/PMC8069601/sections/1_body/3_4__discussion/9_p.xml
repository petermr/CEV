<p>Based on the literature, the total anthocyanins of Cornelian cherries range between 106–850 mg cyanidin-3-glycoside/100 g dm and total phenolics between 1070–2696 mg GAE/100 g [

 <xref rid="B83-animals-11-01063" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Cornelian cherries can be considered a good source of anthocyanins, ascorbic acid and phenolics compared to common red berries, and also represent a potential functional food ingredient [
 <xref rid="B82-animals-11-01063" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] due to their influence on sensorial properties such as color and astringency. For this reason, analysis of the use of these cherries in foods and beverages has developed during recent decades [
 <xref rid="B83-animals-11-01063" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] and it has been reported that total phenolic content, expressed in mg/g, may be almost doubled in a diet supplemented with cornelian extract and essential oils. It was also found that diet supplementation with a combination of cornelian extract and essential oils resulted in the highest interaction with the stable radical DPPH, followed by the cornelian extract itself, which is in agreement with the GC-MS results. Oregano and thyme EOs are rich in carvacrol and thymol, which are phenolic monoterpenoids. It seems that the activity of the essential oil is related to the presence of phenolic compounds. The main role of these components as a reducer of free radicals has been previously reported [
