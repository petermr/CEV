<p>The plant extract used in our study included an aqueous cornus extract and a complex of cornus hydro-extract plus oregano and thyme EOs. It was found that the addition of either cornus extract alone or a mixture of cornus extract with oregano and thyme essential oils to the basal ration of dairy sheep improved milk production, milk yield and fat content, whereas differences in total protein, ash and solids-not-fat were not significant. The increasing effect of oregano and thyme on milk yield may be attributed to the galactopoietic effect of the active compounds present in the essential oils [

Furthermore, it is suggested that positive effects of galactagogues on milk production may be due to the decrease in circulating biogenic amines such as histamine, tryptamine and tyramine in the blood, which are known to cause the excessive release of catecholamines, leading to a reduction in milk production as well as causing indigestion by inhibiting ruminal mobility and absorption [
