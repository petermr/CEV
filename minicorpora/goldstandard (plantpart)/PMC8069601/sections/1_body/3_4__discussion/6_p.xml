<p>The prohibited use of ionophores such as monensin as additives in the EU and the increased interest in ‘naturally occurring additives’ that can also be used in the ‘organic’ production of ruminant milk and meat have resulted in a great deal of interest in identifying naturally occurring compounds that positively affect ruminal fermentation and performance [

 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> supplementation has been found to increase milk yield and the lactation period of Sanjabi ewes [

 <xref rid="B72-animals-11-01063" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. The increase in milk yield and lactation period resulting from thyme supplementation has been associated with the remarkable vasodilator action of thyme essential oil. Particularly, its constituents like bisabolol and bisabolol oxides [
 <xref rid="B72-animals-11-01063" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] may act as vasodilators, increasing the flow in the blood vessels which normally supply the mammary gland with all necessary components for milk production, which is helpful during heat stress periods.
