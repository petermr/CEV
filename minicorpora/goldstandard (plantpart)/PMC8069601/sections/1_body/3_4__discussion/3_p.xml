<p>The properties and composition of oregano and thyme have been well investigated. It was reported that their essential oils possess anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-inflammatory and antihistaminic effects [

 <xref rid="B55-animals-11-01063" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Oregano and thyme essential oils increased mammary gland development in rats, followed by a higher milk yield at different stages of lactation [

 <xref rid="B17-animals-11-01063" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, there are contradictory opinions in the literature regarding the effect of these plants on milk production; some researchers found that by using oregano and thyme as feed additives, milk yield was increased and that the higher levels remained rather constant [

On the other hand, it was reported that no positive effects were achieved in ruminants by supplementing their diet with oregano oil or carvacrol, oreganoâ€™s main constituent. However, it is notable that this study was conducted on dairy cows and the inclusion level of oregano oil or carvacrol was at different levels (50 mg/kg of DM intake) [

 <xref rid="B59-animals-11-01063" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], whereas dietary supplementation with plant extracts rich in flavonoids resulted in increased milk yield in cows [
