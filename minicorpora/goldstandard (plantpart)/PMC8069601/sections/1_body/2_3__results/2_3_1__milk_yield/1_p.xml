<p>Milk yield followed the typical lactation curve and no interactions were observed between treatments and time (trial duration) on daily milk yield over the tested period. However, supplementation of the diet with cornus extract, with and without essential oil, seemed to improve the daily milk yield compared to the control group. The average milk yield in the first days of the trial did not differ among the groups and was found to be 1.74 L/d for the control group and 1.72 L/d for both the Cornus and CorOrThym group, respectively. On day 21 a significant increase in average milk yield of 1.76 L/d (Cornus group) and 1.92 L/d (CorOrThym group), compared to an average milk yield of 1.72 L/d for the control group, was noticed (

However, there was no connection between cornus extract and EO addition on milk composition, except for urea and somatic cell counts (SCCs), which were found to be lower in the more highly EO-supplemented groups (

Although we did not measure any changes in body composition, occasional observations did not suggest that the effects of the EO supplementation were achieved through changes in body mobilization between the treatments. In addition, BW was similar among the groups at the start and at the end of the trial.
