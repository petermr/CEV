 <xref rid="animals-11-01063-t011" ref-type="table">Table 11</xref>. Diet supplementation with cornus extract with/without EO did not seem to affect the levels of total urea, creatin and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (Î³-GT) in the serum among the experimental groups. However, the level of total protein decreased gradually in the Cornus and cornus, oregano and thyme (CorOrThym) groups towards the end of the experimental period. Interestingly, the level of total albumin was increased in the control and Cornus groups but decreased in the CorOrThym group.
