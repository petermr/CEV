<p>A recent major issue during the last two decades concerning dairy sheep farming in the Mediterranean is the high ambient temperatures during the summer season and the first period in autumn. High ambient temperatures, combined with high direct and indirect solar radiation, low wind speed and increased relative humidity, are commonly faced by intensively reared animals that have to survive out of their thermoneutral zone (5 °C to 25 °C) [
