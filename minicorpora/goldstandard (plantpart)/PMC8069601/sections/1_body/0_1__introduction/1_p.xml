<p>The production of sheep milk is of great importance to the agricultural sector in Mediterranean countries, and the largest part of its volume is designated for yoghurt and cheese production [

Several attempts have been made to manipulate rumen efficiency in order to maximize the productivity of ruminants with respect to milk production by including various feed additives in the animalsâ€™ diets, such as antibiotics, hormones, chemical growth promoters [

 <xref rid="B5-animals-11-01063" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Feed additives such as antibiotics, hormones and other pharmaceutical substances, despite their financial benefits, have been prohibited in most countries of the world, mainly due to their potentially hazardous residues and due to the development of multi-drug resistance in bacteria [

 <xref rid="B7-animals-11-01063" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Recent scientific interest has focused on the addition of essential oils to ruminant nutrition in order to improve nutrient utilization efficiency and dairy product quality. Moreover, essential oils at high concentrations inhibit amino acid deamination and decrease methane production [

Additionally, milk and dairy products naturally enriched with antioxidant compounds may provide extra health benefits to the consumer [
