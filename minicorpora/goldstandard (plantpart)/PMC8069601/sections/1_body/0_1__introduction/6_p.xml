<p>The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of diet supplementation with a cornus plant extract alone or in combination with oregano and thyme essential oil on the milk production and composition of dairy sheep reared under heat stress conditions, the effect on animal health, as well as the effect on the nutritional value and the characteristics of two traditional dairy productsâ€”yoghurt and feta cheese. The hypothesis of this study was that the addition of bioactive plant extracts to the sheep nutrition will lead to improved milk yield, along with increased antioxidant activity in the milk, yoghurt and cheese and the capability of animals to cope better with the adverse effects of heat stress. It must be noted that there is a lack of information on the effects of cornus, oregano and thyme in dairy sheep reared during the hot seasons.</p>
