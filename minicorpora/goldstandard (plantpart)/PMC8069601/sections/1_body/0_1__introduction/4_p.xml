<p>The isolation of bioactive compounds from aromatic and medicinal plants is usually performed by extraction using several solvents, most of them organic, which are harmful to the environment. Thus, it is important to explore the use of extraction methods that combine eco-friendly solvents and a high yield of bioactive compounds. Green extraction methods are using aqueous solutions, thereby avoiding organic solvents such as ethanol or methanol or energy-consuming methods such as microwave extraction or high-pressure extraction [

The effectiveness of aqueous solutions of cyclodextrin (CD) as an eco-friendly solvent, appropriate for extracting phenolic compounds and other phytonutrients from plant materials, such as pomegranate, olive leaves, aromatic and medicinal plants or by-products of agricultural production, has been reported [

The extraction of essential oils from aromatic plants can be achieved by means of steam distillation, providing products with a high phenolic content, although at a relatively high cost.
