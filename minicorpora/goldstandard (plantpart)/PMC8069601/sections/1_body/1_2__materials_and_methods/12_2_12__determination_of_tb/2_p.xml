<p>Protein carbonyl determination was based on the method of Patsoukis et al. (2004) [
 <xref rid="B44-animals-11-01063" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In particular, 50 µL of a TCA solution (20% 
 <italic>w/v</italic>) was added to 50 µL of sample homogenate (diluted 1:2 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>). The mixture was then kept in an ice bath for 15 min and centrifuged at 15,000× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded. To the remaining pellet, 500 µL of a 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) solution (10 mmol/L in 2.5 N HCl) were added. The blank was prepared by addition of 500 µL of 2.5 N HCl to the pellet. In this assay, carbonyl formation is detected by the reaction of protein carbonyls with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) and its subsequent conversion to 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone (DNP-hydrazone), which was measured at 375 nm. Calculation of protein carbonyl concentration was based on the molar extinction coefficient of DNPH (22,000 M
