<p>Fresh milk samples were collected on days 1, 21 and 42 of the trial. The samples were analyzed immediately. For the determination of TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances), an aliquot of 100 μL of the fresh milk sample was mixed with 500 μL of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) solution (35 % 
 <italic>w/v</italic>) and 500 μL of Tris–HCl (200 mmol/L; pH 7.4), and incubated for 10 min at 20 °C. Subsequently, 1 mL of 2MNa
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> and 55 mM thiobarbituric acid solution were added, and the samples were incubated at 95 °C for 45 min. Finally, the absorbance was measured at 530 nm against a blank sample using an UV-VIS spectrophotometer (UV-1700 PharmaSpec, Shimadzu, Japan). Results were expressed as μmol MDA per liter of milk.
