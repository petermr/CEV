<p>Essential oil analyses were performed on a Shimadzu GC-2010-GCMS-QP2010 (Kyoto, Japan) system operating at 70 eV. The gas chromatograph (GC) was equipped with a split/splitless injector (230 °C) and a fused silica column INNOWAX (Santa Clara, CA, USA) (30 m × 0.25 mm, film thickness: 0.25 μm). The temperature program was from 50 °C (20 min) to 250 °C, at a rate of 3 °C/min. Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The injection volume of each sample was 1 μL. The injector was set at 230 °C and operated in split mode (split ratio = 1:10), whereas the GC–MS transfer line and the ion source were set at 300 °C and 230 °C, respectively. The mass spectrometer was operated in electron ionization mode (70 eV) and full-scan mass spectra were acquired from m/z 100 to 600. The relative percentage amounts of the separated compounds were calculated from the total ion chromatogram by a computerized integrator. The identification of the components was based on comparison of their mass spectra with those of NIST21 and NIST107 [
