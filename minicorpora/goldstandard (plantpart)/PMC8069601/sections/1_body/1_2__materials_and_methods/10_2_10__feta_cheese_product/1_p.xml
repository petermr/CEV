<p>Fresh sheep milk was standardized to a protein-to-fat ratio of 1.0, pasteurized at 63 °C for 30 min, and then cooled to 35 °C. Cheese manufacturing was carried out according to the traditional procedure. In brief, calcium chloride solution (0.2%

 <italic>v</italic>) was added to the cheese milk. The milk was held for 30 min at 35 °C for culture maturation. Afterwards, powdered calf rennet was added to achieve coagulation in about 50 min at 35 °C. After coagulation, the curd was cut into cubes of 2 cm and left to rest for 10 min. The sliced curd was then transferred into molds, stored at 18 °C and turned every hour for 3 h for whey drainage, surface salted using dry salt and left overnight to complete whey drainage. Following, the cheeses were placed in containers with brine (7%) and kept at 18 °C for approximately 10 days for cheese ripening. Subsequently, the cheese containers were sealed and stored at 4 °C for a total ripening period of 60 days. Samples were collected on day 60 of ripening and subjected to physicochemical analyses. The pH of the cheeses was determined by a pH meter (GLP-21, CRISON Instruments SA., Barcelona, Spain). The moisture content was determined by the sea sand method, e.g., by thoroughly mixing 2 g of sample with 20 g sea sand and heating at 105 °C until it was constant in weight [
