<p>The antioxidant activity of the essential oils and the corresponding feed stuff was determined with respect to hydrogen-donating or radical-scavenging ability, according to the method of Peperidou et al. (2014) [
 <xref rid="B36-animals-11-01063" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], using the stable radical 1.1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). Ten microliters of the test samples, which were dissolved in methanol (20 mg/mL stock solution), were added to a solution of DPPH (0.1 mM in DMSO). After 20 and 60 min the absorbance was recorded at 517 nm and the percentage of reducing activity (RA) was calculated and compared with the reference compound, nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA).
