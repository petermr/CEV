<p>The concentrate fed to the three different experimental groups was also analyzed for its total phenolic content according to the method of Singleton et al. (1999) [
 <xref rid="B35-animals-11-01063" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] using the Folin–Ciocalteu assay and expressed as gallic acid equivalents (GAE). An aliquot (1 mL) of the sample or a standard solution of gallic acid (blank, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 µg/mL) was transferred into a 25 mL volumetric flask, containing 9 mL of distilled water. Subsequently, 1 mL of Folin–Ciocalteu phenol reagent (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) was added to the mixture and shaken. After 5 min, 10 mL of a sodium carbonate (Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub>) solution (7% 
 <italic>w/w</italic>) was added to the mixture. After incubating for 90 min at room temperature, the absorbance was measured against the reagent blank at 550 nm with a UV-VIS spectrophotometer (UV-1700 PharmaSpec, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). For the milk, yoghurt and cheese samples, 5 g were mixed with 25 mL of an aqueous methanol solution (ratio of methanol to water: 75:15). The mixture was stirred for 30 min and centrifuged for 15 min at 7200 rpm. The upper phase was filtered through a nylon syringe filter (filter diameter: 25 mm, pore size: 0.22 μm, Frisenette, Knebel, Denmark), and analyzed for gallic acid equivalents using the procedure described above.
