<p>Yoghurt was produced by sheep milk. Five liters of milk from each group (Control, Cornus and CorOrThym) were collected and heated for 8 min at 92 °C, followed by cooling to 42 °C, and the addition of the standard yogurt starter culture under aseptic conditions. Subsequently, the milk was transferred into 200-mL plastic retail containers, sealed, kept quiescent and incubated at 42 °C for 3 h. Afterwards, the samples were immediately stored at 5 °C. After 72 h, the yoghurt samples were subjected to physicochemical and organoleptic analyses. All yoghurt trials were repeated twice. Enumeration of 
 <italic>Lactobacilus bulgaricus</italic> and 
 <italic>Streprococcus thermophilus</italic> populations were conducted using the pour plate technique and carried out after 10 days of storage at 4 °C. An aliquot of 1 g of yoghurt was diluted in 9 mL of peptone water, containing sodium chloride (0.9% 
 <italic>w/v</italic>), followed by seven sequential dilutions (10
 <sup>−1</sup>–10
 <sup>−7</sup>). A quantity of 1 mL of the diluted sample of 10
 <sup>−4</sup> up to 10
 <sup>−7</sup> was placed in M17 agar (Merck, Germany) and each petri was incubated at 37 °C for 72 h. For each sample, the mean numbers of colony forming units (CFU) per gram of yoghurt was estimated.
