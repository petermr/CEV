<p>Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were prepared according to [

 <xref rid="B42-animals-11-01063" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Analysis of FAMEs was performed on an Agilent Technologies 6890N gas chromatograph (GC), equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) (Santa Clara, CA, USA) and a DB-23 capillary column (60 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25-μm film thickness). Each peak was identified and quantified using a 37 component FAME mix (Supelco, 47885-U) and the PUFA-2, Animal source (Supelco, 47015-U) (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany). After analysis, the saturated fatty acids (SFA), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), unsaturated fatty acids (UFA), n-3 PUFA and n-6 PUFA were further grouped together. The index for atherogenicity (AI) was determined as suggested by [
 <xref rid="B43-animals-11-01063" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] Ulbricht and Southgate (1991), and the Δ−9 desaturase activity indexes were calculated using the following four ratios: C14:1/C14:0, C16:1/C16:0, C18:1/C18:0 and CLA/VA.
