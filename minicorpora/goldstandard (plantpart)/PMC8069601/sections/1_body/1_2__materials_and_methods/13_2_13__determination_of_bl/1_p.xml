<p>The influence of the different diets on animal health indices was also evaluated by analyzing specific biochemical parameters in the blood serum. Blood samples were obtained from each ewe by jugular venipuncture into 10 mL vacuum tubes without anticoagulant with a needle, on the first and last day of the experiment. Samples were centrifuged (1600× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min in 4 °C), and the collected serum was frozen at −20 °C until analysis. The biochemical parameters tested in the serum were total proteins, albumins, glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatine and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-Gt) and they were assayed using an automated analyzer (TARGA CLIN/CHEM Analyzer, BT 1500 Biotechnica instruments Roma, Italy).
