<p>A total of 45 lactating ewes of the Chios cross-breed were randomly selected for twin birth from a flock consisting of 150 ewes, kept on a dairy breeding sheep farm located in the area of Polykastro (Latitude: 41°00′ N; Longitude: 22°33′ E) in the northwestern part of Kilkis in Greece. The daily mean temperature during July and August (2020) ranged between 27–34 °C.

The ewes were allocated into three equally sized treatment groups of 15 ewes, each consisting of 5 subgroups housed in a separate pen. Each group and subgroup was balanced for body weight (BW) three weeks after lambing, parity and body condition. The three treatment groups were fed isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets. Group 1 (Control) was fed the basal ration with Lucerne hay and wheat straw and a concentrate containing maize, soybean meal and sunflower meal as the main constituents (

The diet of group 2 was supplemented with cornus extract at a level 0.5 g per kg of concentrate and that of group 3 with a cornus extract plus oregano and thyme essential oils, at a level of 0.5 g cornus extract, 0.01 g oregano and 0.005 g thyme essential oil per kg of concentrate, respectively (Cornus and CorOrThym groups). All plant extracts were provided by ORIZON Diatrofiki, Serres, Greece. At the start of the trial, the ewes were in the third month of their second lactation (on average two months after lamb weaning) and were acclimatized to the experimental conditions for two weeks prior to starting. The mean initial BW was 54.4 ± 1.65 kg and the trial lasted for 45 days plus acclimatization of two weeks, and the mean milk yield was 1.73 L/d. The final BW was 55.3 ± 1.44 kg. After weaning, the ewes were machine milked twice daily (at 6:30 and 17:00 h) in a 24-parallel milking parlor with individual ear-tag identification.
