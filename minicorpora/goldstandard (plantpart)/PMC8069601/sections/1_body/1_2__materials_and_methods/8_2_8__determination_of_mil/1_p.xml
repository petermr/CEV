<p>The milk yield of each ewe was recorded weekly by the total volume measurement method. Each sheep was recognized by their individual ear tag. Individual milk samples were analyzed for total fat, total protein, lactose, total solids, total viable counts and solid-not-fat (SNF) by means of near-infrared spectroscopy using a MilkoScan 4000 (FOSS Electric, Integrated Milk TestingTM, Hiller√∏d, Denmark) and somatic cell counts were determined using a Fossomatic 5000 Basic (FOSS Electric, Denmark). Milk acidity was measured using a portable titrator.</p>
