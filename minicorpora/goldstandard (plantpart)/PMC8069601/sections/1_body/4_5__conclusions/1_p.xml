<p>A clear finding of the current study is that the composition of herbal mixtures can greatly influence the performance outcomes of dairy sheep reared under stress conditions. Heat stress is a major issue in Mediterranean sheep farming as it may negatively affect milk yield and composition. Although the Chios breed and its crossbreeds are maintained and adapted to temperate climatic conditions, they also suffer when environmental temperature exceeds the thermoneutral zone. The current study suggests that dietary antioxidant compounds included in cornus, oregano and thyme have a positive impact on heat stress reduction and redox homeostasis. The addition of a specific cornus mixture with EO compounds of oregano and thyme had beneficial effects on milk production, urea concentration and SCC in milk samples of dairy ewes of the Chios crossbreed in the hot summer period. The addition of cornus hydrodistillation extract, as well as oregano and thyme essential oils, improved the oxidative stability of milk, cheese and yoghurt. However, the fatty acid profile in milk, cheese and yoghurt was not affected by the dietary addition of cornus extract and oregano and thyme EOs during the third month of lactation. Future research efforts should focus on defining specific types and compositions of various plant extracts and EOs in order to optimize their level of addition, thus resulting in favorable and consistent responses and effectively utilizing their benefits.</p>
