<p>Cold-pressed fats and oils are edible products obtained by mechanical procedures, such as expelling or pressing, during which no heat is applied, and no modification of the oil occurs. Purification of these oils can only occur through water washing, settling, filtration and centrifugation [

Cold-pressing preserves a large amount of antioxidants (e.g., tocopherols, polyphenolic compounds) and also polyunsaturated fatty acids of the n-3 and n-6 group as well as sterols, indicating a potential of cold-pressed oils in antioxidant and bioactive effects [
