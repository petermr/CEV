<p>The aim of the study was to examine combinations of base oils and herbal additives with a view to obtaining macerates with improved pro-health properties compared to pure base oils. For this purpose total low molecular weight antioxidant activity and tocopherol level were measured in oils cold-pressed from the plants of eight species (oilseed rape, black cumin, safflower, hazel, borage, walnut, evening primrose, sea-buckthorn), and macerates obtained through the addition of herbs from the 
 <italic>Lamiaceae</italic> family— common basil, sage, and thyme. Additionally, the chemical properties of oil cakes left after the cold-press of oil were analyzed by measuring the level of fibre, vitamin C, β-carotene, lutein, total tocopherols and total antioxidant activity.
