<p>Living conditions in industrialized countries are especially conducive to the development of oxidative stress, and the multitude of stimulating factors only exacerbates this phenomenon. Therefore, a diet rich in bioactive compounds, especially antioxidants, is currently one of the solutions that can help protect organisms against the destructive effects of oxidative stress [
