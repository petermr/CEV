<p>Tocopherols belong to the main components of the unsaponifiable fraction of vege-table oils, which are present in varying quantities. They are natural antioxidants occurring in four forms: α, β, γ and δ, which, show different antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B54-antioxidants-10-00781" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In the literature, many studies can be found proving that the content of individual tocopherols (or other bioactive compounds) is influenced by many factors, such as the plant variety from which the oil was pressed, as demonstrated by López Ortíz et al. [
 <xref rid="B55-antioxidants-10-00781" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], who showed differences in the content of α-tocopherol (14.8–21,8 mg/100 g of oil) between seven varieties of olives. The level and profile of tocopherols in oilseeds (e.g., sunflower, soybean or oilseed rape) is also highly dependent on environmental conditions, particularly temperature, and much less on the genotype [
 <xref rid="B56-antioxidants-10-00781" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In accordance with previously published data [
 <xref rid="B57-antioxidants-10-00781" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,
 <xref rid="B58-antioxidants-10-00781" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], this study also identified α- and γ-tocopherols as the main tocopherols in vegetable oils and fats. According to Schwartz et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-antioxidants-10-00781" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], Grilo et al. [
 <xref rid="B59-antioxidants-10-00781" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], and Shahidi and de Camargo [
 <xref rid="B60-antioxidants-10-00781" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] γ-tocopherol is the main form of tocochromanol present in cold-pressed oils. In most of the oils discussed in this work, α-tocopherol was the most abundant, followed by γ-tocopherol. The exception was borage seed oil, where the dominant tocopherol form was δ-tocopherol, and evening primrose oil, where it was γ-tocopherol, and these results are consistent with the studies of Fabrikov et al. [
 <xref rid="B61-antioxidants-10-00781" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], Hudson [
 <xref rid="B62-antioxidants-10-00781" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] and Christie [
 <xref rid="B63-antioxidants-10-00781" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. As regards total tocopherols, some of the tested oils naturally contained relatively high content of tocopherols (even about 600–800 μg/g [hazelnut oil or borage seed oil]). In such cases, herbal supplementation was not very effective. An exception was safflower seed oil, with a similarly high content of native tocopherols, where the addition of thyme elevated total tocopherols even to the level higher than 1 mg/g. These combinations of oil with herbal raw material, where tocopherol content increased are most likely the result of tocopherol extraction from the herbal raw material.
