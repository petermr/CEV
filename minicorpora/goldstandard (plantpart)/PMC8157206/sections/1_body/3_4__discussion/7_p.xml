<p>Apart from the characteristics of cold-pressed oils and macerates, the study also analyzed selected nutritional values of oil cake left after pressing the oil. According to literature, protein and dietary fibre are the dominant dry matter components of oil cake [
 <xref rid="B48-antioxidants-10-00781" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Our research also showed a high proportion of fibre (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00781-f003">Figure 3</xref>A)—on average 30% up to maximum about 70% (in safflower oil cake). The tested oil cakes were also characterized by high antioxidant activity. In the oils, TAA values were usually around 2 μmol Trolox eq/g, while in the oil cakes they ranged from over 4 to even 10 μmol Trolox eq/g. One of the causes could be the fact that a characteristic feature of each oil cake type is phenolic compound content [
 <xref rid="B73-antioxidants-10-00781" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Most of the phenolic compounds and other fat-insoluble antioxidants do not pass into the oil but remain in the oil cake, influencing antioxidant activity [

 <xref rid="B76-antioxidants-10-00781" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. These authors showed high content of phenolic compounds and high antioxidant activity in extracts from evening primrose seed oil cake (tested also in our study). Shahidi et al. [
 <xref rid="B74-antioxidants-10-00781" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] identified isoflavones, proanthocyanidins and gallic acid derivatives in the above-mentioned oil cake. Our study additionally showed that oil cake also retains relatively large quantities of other antioxidants such as tocopherols (hazelnut), β-carotene and vitamin C (sea buckthorn).
