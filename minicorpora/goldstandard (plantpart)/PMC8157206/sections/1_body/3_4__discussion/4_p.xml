<p>The biological activity of tocopherols, which results from their antioxidant properties and differs between their various forms, is crucially important from the nutritional point of view. It is the highest for α-tocopherol, lower for γ-tocopherol (10% α-tocopherol), and the lowest for δ-tocopherol (3% α-tocopherol) [

Taking into account these differences between tocopherols, safflower, hazelnut and rapeseed oils are the most valuable because they contain the highest amount of α-tocopherol. Safflower oil is particularly remarkable, as it not only contains the highest level of total tocopherols, but over 99% of it is the most active α-tocopherol. This high α-tocopherol content makes safflower oil an excellent dietary source of vitamin E, but it is also the reason for its low thermal stability in high temperature applications such as deep frying or machine lubrication [

In some of the tested combinations a decrease in tocopherol content was observed, possibly caused by the extraction of compounds reacting directly or indirectly with tocopherols. Such compounds may include chlorophyll, which in free form becomes a source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [

Under conditions where hydrophobic oil is the solvent, the generated ROS will react primarily with hydrophobic antioxidants, including tocopherols. A more detailed comparison of the content of individual bioactive compounds (including tocopherols) in, among others, black cumin, safflower, hazelnut, walnut and oilseed rape oil can be found in the study of Ramadan et al.
