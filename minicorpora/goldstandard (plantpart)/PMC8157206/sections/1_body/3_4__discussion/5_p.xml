<p>In addition to the level of tocopherols, total low molecular weight antioxidant activity (TAA) expressed as Î¼mol of Trolox eq/g was also measured in the study. The addition of sage caused a significant increase in total antioxidant activity in every oil, whereas the other herbs did not cause such an obvious effect. This can be explained by the highest antioxidant activity of the compounds contained in sage in comparison to the other tested herbs. According to Hossain et al. [
 <xref rid="B68-antioxidants-10-00781" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], this activity is two-fold higher in sage than in basil or thyme. In our experiment, TAA also depended on the properties of the base oil. The highest values of TAA were obtained in the case of black cumin seed oil after the addition of each of the three herbs, but relatively high values were also recorded in oilseed rape oil.
