<p>This study shows that the effect of herbal supplementation on total tocopherol and total antioxidant activity of cold-pressed oils depended on both the base oil and the species of the added herb. The addition of herbs to the tested oils had different effects on their composition. An illustration of this is the case of evening primrose oil, in which the addition of sage lowered the level of tocopherols, the addition of basil increased the content of these compounds, and the addition of thyme had no effect. The presented research demonstrates that the composition of the macerate is affected by all three factorsâ€”the type of herb, its amount (50 g or 100 g), and the supplementation method (PP, L, IP). This is in agreement with other authors such as Tongnuanchan and Benjakul [
