<p>Interestingly, however, a comparison of tocopherol content and TAA showed that there was no direct connection between them. It can be explained by the fact that the DPPH method of TAA measurement also quantifies other antioxidants, e.g., glutathione, ascorbic acid, phenols, polyphenols, flavonoids, anthocyanins, polysaccharides, and tannins [
 <xref rid="B69-antioxidants-10-00781" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], thus tocopherols were not the only players responsible for the antioxidant properties of the tested oils. The most striking example was the comparison of safflower oil—which was characterized by the highest tocopherol content—with black cumin seed oil. Black cumin seed oil contained several times less tocopherols than safflower oil, but simultaneously had the highest total antioxidant activity, especially after supplementation with herbal raw material. In this case other substances, such as aromatic compounds, must have been responsible for the antioxidant properties of this oil (probably also other oils with high TAA values as well) [

 <xref rid="B71-antioxidants-10-00781" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], black cumin seed oil contained particularly high quantities of aromatic compounds among the oils used in this study. This finding was partly confirmed also by the results of our preliminary research. Black cumin seed oil was characterized by extremely high content of essential oils in comparison to other oils (
