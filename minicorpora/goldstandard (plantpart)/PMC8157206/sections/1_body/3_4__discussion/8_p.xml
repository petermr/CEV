<p>To summarize, the effect of herbal supplementation on total tocopherols and total antioxidant activity of macerates depended both on the base oil and the species of the added herb. For tocopherols, some of the tested oils naturally contained relatively high content of tocopherols—even about 600–800 μg/g [hazelnut oil and borage seed oil]. In such cases, herbal supplementation was not very effective. One exception was safflower seed oil, with a similarly high amount of native tocopherols, where the addition of thyme increased total tocopherols even to the content of about 1 mg/g. As for total antioxidant activity, record values were noted in the case of black cumin seed oil after the addition of each of the three herbs, but relatively high values were also noted in oilseed rape oil.</p>
