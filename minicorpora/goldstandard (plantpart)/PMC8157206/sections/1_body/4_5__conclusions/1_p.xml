<p>Total tocopherols and total antioxidant activity of macerates depended both on the species from which the oil was cold-pressed and the species of the added herb. This study can serve as a starting point for the development of healthy oils and oil cakes with high antioxidant contents, but simultaneously one should bear in mind that the addition of herbs to the tested oils had different effects on their composition (from positive influence on antioxidant properties, to neutral or even negative effects). On the other hand, one must also remember that the results are based on two methods of analysis (TAA, tocopherols). In the future further analysis, allowing more detailed characterization of the material, would be interesting. Generally, the addition of herbal preparations to the oils could be considered a sophistication which can alter the original properties of the oils.</p>
