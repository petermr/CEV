<p>The study was conducted on base oils, macerates (base oils + herbs) and oil cakes obtained after pressing base oils from raw materials (
 <xref rid="antioxidants-10-00781-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Base oils, constituting reference samples (control oil), were prepared from the following raw materials: seeds of black cumin (
 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> L.), borage (
 <italic>Borago officinalis</italic> L.), evening primrose (
 <italic>Oenothera biennis</italic> L.), safflower (
 <italic>Carthamus tinctorius</italic> L.), walnut (
 <italic>Juglans regia</italic> L.), common hazel (
 <italic>Corylus avellana</italic> L.), and oilseed rape (
 <italic>Brassica napus</italic> L.), as well as the flesh of sea-buckthorn berries (
 <italic>Hippophae rhamnoides</italic> L.) (

After visual qualitative evaluation, raw materials were pressed on a slow-speed screw press (Farmet, UNO 1,1 kW, Czech Republic), which made it possible to control the pressing temperature. All the oils were pressed in the temperature range of 33–35 °C, and immediately afterwards gravity filtered and allowed to cool to a temperature of about 15 °C, then poured into tightly closed containers. The sea-buckthorn berries were first macerated with rapeseed oil in a 1:1 proportion, and then the oil was obtained using the same procedure as in the case of seeds.
