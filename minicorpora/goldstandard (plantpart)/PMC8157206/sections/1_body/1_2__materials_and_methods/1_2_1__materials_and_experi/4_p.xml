 <xref rid="antioxidants-10-00781-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), was transferred to washed and scalded glassware. Then, base oil in the amount of 250 mL was poured over the herbal material. The tightly closed vessels were placed in a dark room at a constant temperature of 15 °C for a period of 10 days. After this period, the macerates were poured into tightly closed 250 mL dark glass containers (bottles). The collected material was stored in a refrigerated counter at 8–10 °C, and subsequently subjected to further biochemical analyses. The total number of studied combinations was 160, i.e., 8 oil cakes and 152 oils (8 base oils and 144 macerates).
