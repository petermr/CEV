<p>Statistical analyses (ANOVA, post-hoc test) were performed using Statistica 13 (StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA). The number of repetitions (
 <italic>n</italic>) for a particular measurement and information about what constitutes a repetition is provided in the description of a particular analytical method. In the case of tocopherol content (
