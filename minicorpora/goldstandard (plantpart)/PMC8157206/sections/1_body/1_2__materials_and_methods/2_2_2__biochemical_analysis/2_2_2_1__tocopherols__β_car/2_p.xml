<p>Tocopherols (in base oil and oil cakes), β-carotene and lutein (in oil cakes) were analysed with HPLC-MS method based on modified protocol of Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="B50-antioxidants-10-00781" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], where saponification step was eliminated. Briefly, 100 µL samples (oil or chloroformic extract) were dissolved in 0.5 mL chloroform and 0.5 mL phase A (described below). These samples were injected to Agilent Technologies 1260 HPLC coupled to 6410 Tandem Mass Spectrometer. The apparatus was equipped with Waters NOVA-PAK C18 4 μm 3.9 × 300 mm HPLC column, phase A was acetonitryle/methanol/water (72/8/3 
 <italic>v/v/v</italic>) mixture and phase B was methanol/ethyl acetate (68/32 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) mixture. Flow rate was 1 mL/min, temperature was set to 35 °C, and the gradient program was set as follows: 0–11 min 4% B, 11–20 min linear increase 4–80% B, 20–33 min 80% B, 33–34 min linear decrease 80–4% B. Compounds were detected according to their secondary ions (MRM mode-Multiple Reaction Monitoring): lutein 568.1→569.4; β-carotene 536.4→537.3; α-tocopherol 430.4→165.1; γ-tocopherol 416.4→151.1; δ-tocopherol 402.4→137.1, with the same MRMs used for quantification (analyzed compounds produced only these MRMs in relatively high abundance). Source was ESI (ElectroSpray Ionisation) set to gas temperature 350 °C, gas flow 11 l/min, nebulizer 15 psi, capillary 4000 V in positive mode. Compounds were detected according to their secondary ions (MRM mode) and their concentrations were calculated according to 10-point calibration curves.
