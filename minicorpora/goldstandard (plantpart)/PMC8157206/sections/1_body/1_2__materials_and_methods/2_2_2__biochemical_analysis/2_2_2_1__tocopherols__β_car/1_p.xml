<p>Two types of samples were analyzed—oils and oil cakes. Chemical analyses of oils were conducted directly on oil samples, whereas oil cakes were mixed with chloroform, homogenized mechanically in a mortar, sonicated in ultrasonic bath (Polsonic Sonic 5, Warszawa, Poland) for 10 min, then incubated at 4 °C for 24 h and finally centrifuged (3500× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min). The supernatant was collected and analyzed with the same method as raw oil. For each combination—one type of base oil with additives or one type of oil cake—9 measurements were performed, 3 measurements on 3 independent samples, giving a total of 456 oil samples + 24 oil cakes samples = 480 samples and standards of the tested compounds.
