<p>Dietary fibre content was determined with Total Dietary Fiber Assay Kit (Megazyme Ltd., Ireland) according to the procedure recommended by the producer. In brief, homogenized samples were washed with hexane to remove fat, then dried. Dry samples were mixed with MES-TRIS blend buffer solution (pH 8.2) and digested with α-amylase and later with protease. Then pH was changed to 4.1–4.8 and the samples were digested with amyloglucosidase. Finally, dietary fibre was precipitated with ethanol and collected in a crucible. After that crucibles with samples were dried and weighted. Additionally, the content of residue proteins (through the measurement of N content) and ash (through incineration at 525 °C) was determined in each sample and subtracted from the final result. Measurements were carried out in 6 replicates (3 per protein weight and 3 per ash weight) from the pooled sample for each combination plus 2 blanks for a total of 50 samples.</p>
