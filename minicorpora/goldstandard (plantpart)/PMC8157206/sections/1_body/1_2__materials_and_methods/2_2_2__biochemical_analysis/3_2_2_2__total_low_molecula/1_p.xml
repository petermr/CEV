<p>TAA was measured using the DPPH method according to Brand-Williams et al. [

 <xref rid="B52-antioxidants-10-00781" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. A solution of 0.5 mM of stable free radical 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH, SIGMA, Munich, Germany) in methanol was used. Absorbance was determined after 30 min of the reaction at 37 °C at 515 nm using reader Model 680 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Trolox was used as the standard in the following eight concentrations: 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5, and 3 nM. Each concentration was pipetted (17.5 μL) into three wells and then 250 μL of 0.5 mM DPPH solution was added on each microtiter plate. Trolox equivalents for each measurement were calculated using the equation of linear regression from the calibration curve presenting linear relationships between absorbance and different Trolox concentrations. The results were expressed as μmoles of Trolox equivalents per 1 g of oil, macerate or oil cake.
