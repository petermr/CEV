<p>For each oil and macerate, three 200 µL samples were pipetted into 1.5 mL vials and their weight was determined. Next, after adding 500 µL absolute ethanol (EMPLURA Ethanol absolute, Merck, Munich, Germany), the samples were shaken for 2 h at room temperature and in the dark on a Yellow Line OS 5 Basic shaker (560 cycles/min). Next, after phase separation, each sample was measured three times on separate plates by pipetting 50 µL from the upper alcoholic phase and then 250 μL of 0.5 mM DPPH solution into 3 wells of the microtiter plate.</p>
