<p>Ascorbic acid content was determined with Ascorbic Acid Assay Kit (Megazyme Ltd., Ireland) according to the procedure recommended by the producer. In short, homogenized samples were washed with hexane to remove fat and dried. Dry samples were mixed with metaphosphoric acid buffer, mixed, sonicated and centrifuged. Supernatant was collected and mixed with MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) solution. After 3 min PMS (5-methylphenazinium methosulphate) solution was added and finally absorbance (A) at 578 nm was read with Synergy 2 Microplate Reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc., United States) microplate reader. The ascorbic acid content (C) was calculated according to 10-point calibration curve according to the following equation:
 <disp-formula>A(sample) − A(blank) = 0.0025113 × C [ug/mL] + 0.0029987
  <label>(1)</label>
