<p>In the case of safflower oil, the addition of sage and basil had no statistically significant effect on total tocopherols (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00781-f001">Figure 1</xref>E). The only exception was the addition of 50 g of basil leaves (L), which caused a statistically significant increase in tocopherol level in this oil. The addition of thyme generally increased the level of tocopherols in safflower oil (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00781-f001">Figure 1</xref>E), especially in the case of 50 g of leaves (L), 50 g of intact plant (IP) and 100 g of plants cut into pieces (PP). In other cases, the amount of total tocopherols was also elevated but not in a statistically significant way.
