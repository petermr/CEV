<p>As expected, oils from different plant species were differentiated with regard to the content of total tocopherols. Total tocopherols were calculated as the sum of measured α-tocopherol, γ-tocopherol and δ-tocopherol (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-antioxidants-10-00781">Figures S1–S3, A-H in the Supplementary Material</xref>). The lowest content of total tocopherols was found in black cumin seed oil (less than 40 μg/g of control oil;

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00781-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). In almost all control oils (without additives) the level of α-tocopherol was the highest (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-antioxidants-10-00781">Figure S2H</xref>) and borage seed oil characterized by the highest level of δ-tocopherol (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-antioxidants-10-00781">Figure S3B</xref>). Compared to the dominant tocopherol, the remaining tocopherols were usually found in much lower quantities—even several hundred times lower. The effect of herbal supplementation on total tocopherols was very diverse and depended on the base oil and the species of the herb, ranging from a positive effect (an increase in the level of tocopherols) through no effect, to a negative effect (a decrease in the level of tocopherols).
