<p>The oil cakes were characterized by different chemical composition, which, as expected, was influenced by the plant species from which they were obtained (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-antioxidants-10-00781">Figure S4A–C</xref>). The highest amounts of fibre were found in safflower (more than 60%) and evening primrose oil cakes (about 50%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00781-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). In the case of other oil cakes, the amount of fibre was lower, with statistically significant differences between species. The highest amount of β-carotene (about 2500 μg/g) was recorded in sea-buckthorn oil cake (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00781-f003">Figure 3</xref>C). In hazelnut oil cake the dominant tocopherol was α-tocopherol and in borage oil cake it was δ-tocopherol (similarly as in respective oils) (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-antioxidants-10-00781">Figure S4A,C</xref>). In walnut oil cake, mainly γ-tocopherol remained after oil extraction (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00781-f003">Figure 3</xref>D). Among the examined oil cakes, the highest lutein content was found in oilseed rape oil cake (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00781-f003">Figure 3</xref>E). Particularly low content of lutein (below 0.2 μg/g, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00781-f003">Figure 3</xref>E) was noted in oil cakes of safflower, walnut, hazelnut and evening primrose. Among the examined oil cakes, the highest total antioxidant activity was noted for oilseed rape oil cake (more than 10 μmoles of Trolox equivalents). In other oil cakes, antioxidant activity was comparable but lower by half than in oilseed rape (
