<p>All the essential oils and the mixtures were analyzed via gas chromatography—GC (Trace GC ultra, Thermo, Waltham, MA, USA)—coupled with a mass spectrometer—MS (Polaris-Q, Thermo, Waltham, MA, USA)—in order to identify the main chemical compounds. An Rxi-5Sil MS (Restek, France) (40 m × 0.18 mm; thickness 0.18 µm) column was used and helium was the carrier gas (1 mL/min). A solution (0.8 µL) prepared in hexane at 0.5% was injected for each essential oil (splitless mode) with a temperature program set as follows: 50 °C for 6 min followed by an increase of 2 °C/min until reaching a temperature of 250 °C, which was then held for 10 min. The detector and injector temperatures were fixed at 200 °C and 240 °C, respectively. Major compounds were first analyzed in order to identify their retention indices, which were further used to identify the essential oils’ components. Peak area percentages were used to obtain quantitative data (
