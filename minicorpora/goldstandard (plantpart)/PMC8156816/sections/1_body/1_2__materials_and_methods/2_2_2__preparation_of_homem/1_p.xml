<p>The mixtures were prepared at the desired percentages and diluted in DMSO (5% maximum) to a final concentration of 2 mg/mL (same concentration for the essential oils and for compounds alone). Mixture 1 (M1) was an ajowan mixture comprised of 50% thymol, 25% 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene, 20% 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, and 5% 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene. Mixture 2 (M2) was a thyme chemotype thymol mixture comprised of 50% thymol, 20% 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, 10% 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene, and 20% other minor compounds (5% each: 
 <italic>β</italic>-myrcene, linalool, 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene, and carvacrol). Mixtures 3 to 7 (M3 to M7) contained an increasing concentration of thymol and the same decreasing concentrations of 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene. Mixture 8 to 10 (M8 to M10) were mixtures two by two (50/50 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) of the three most active compounds, thymol, carvacrol, and 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene, and mixture 11 (M11) was a mixture 33.3/33.3/33.3 (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) of the three compounds together. GC–MS analyses were performed on these mixtures to verify if the concentrations were well respected since the mixtures were made according to the volume and not the molecular weight of each compound.
