<p>As mentioned by many authors, due to the high variability of the test methods, the adjustments made by the authors, and the variability in chemical compositions of the tested essential oils, comparison of the results between studies is very difficult [

 <xref rid="B31-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. For ajowan essential oil, no studies were found using the same tested strains. However, against the MRSA ATCC 700698, Zomorodian et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] found an MIC of 1 mg/mL, close to the 500 μg/mL observed for the MRSA LMG 15795, but 4-fold higher than the one found for the LMG 21,674 strain. In the case of thyme essential oil, against the same strain as in this study, Boskovic et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] found an MIC of 320 μg/mL and Sienkiewicz et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] found an MIC of 25 μg/mL with thyme oils composed of 50.48% and 38.1% thymol, respectively. These results are quite similar to the ones obtained in this study where the samples had an average thymol concentration of 56.92%. Essential oils containing thymol are often described as possessing potent antibacterial properties [
 <xref rid="B35-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Regarding the antibacterial activity of thymol against MRSA strains, results found in the literature are often comparable to the ones obtained in this study. Kifer et al. [
 <xref rid="B36-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and Hamoud et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] found MICs of 125 to 250 μg/mL against strains identified as MRSA. Nostro et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and Cirino et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] found MICs a little bit higher, around 600 μg/mL, against the same strain and other MRSA strains, respectively. Of note, those concentrations are toxic against human immortalized keratinocytes (
