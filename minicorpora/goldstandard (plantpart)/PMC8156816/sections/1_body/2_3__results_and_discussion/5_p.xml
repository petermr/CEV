<p>Being a chemotype essential oil as described by the European pharmacopoeia seems to force suppliers to pay more attention to the composition of their batches. In fact, ajowan essential oil is not described in the European pharmacopeia, and related or not, its chemical composition tends to be irregular among suppliers (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00584-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Only AW-S6, and quite comparably AW-S1, had a composition with thymol as the major compound, followed by 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene and 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene present at equivalent percentages (around 20%). Among the other purchased essential oils, some had 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene as the major compound (AW-S2 and AW-S3) or in percentage equivalent to thymol (AW-S4) while others had 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (AW-S7) as the major compound or in percentage equivalent to thymol (AW-S5 and AW-S8). However, thymol as the major compound (around 50%) of ajowan essential oil is stated as being the normal composition [

 <xref rid="B26-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. As mentioned before, it is known that the composition of an essential oil can vary among the same species because of many factors, such as genetic profiles, environmental changes, harvesting parameters, mode of obtention, and so on [
 <xref rid="B19-antibiotics-10-00584" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. If this variability is scientifically noteworthy, it should not be acceptable to detect such high variability in the composition of commercially available essential oils obtained from plant materials characterized by a similar botanical definition. Essential oils could be used as therapeutic products. It should be a priority for the consumer to be informed about the exact major composition of the essential oils since a different composition can lead to a different biological activity than the one stated by the manufacturer.
