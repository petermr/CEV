<p>Concerning the direct activity toward 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> LMG 21,674 (FUSR), the ajowan essential oils presented an MIC of 250 μg/mL, and the thyme chemotype thymol essential oil had an MIC of 125 μg/mL. Against the other MRSA strain (LMG 15975), the essential oils were less active, with a MIC two-fold superior. Despite the variability in chemical compositions of the ajowan essential oils, there was no difference observed in the direct activity against those two strains. In order to identify the compound(s) responsible for the activity, they were tested alone. No direct activity against any of the tested strains were presented by 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene and 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene. It seems that thymol is the main compound responsible for the direct activity. The same MICs were observed for thymol and thyme chemotype thymol essential oils comprised of at least 50% thymol. For the ajowan essential oils, the thymol was present in lesser concentrations and consequently the MIC of ajowan essential oils were two-fold superior to the ones of thymol on both strains.
