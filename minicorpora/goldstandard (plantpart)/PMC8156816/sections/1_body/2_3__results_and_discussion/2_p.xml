 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00584-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows information about the purchased ajowan and thyme chemotype thymol essential oils. The terms used by the supplier for the plant organ were maintained. In the case of the ajowan essential oils, the terms fruit and seed refer to the same organ, but the correct botanical identification is fruit. The last column shows the price at which the essential oils were bought. The price is obviously not indicative of effectiveness since many factors (from producing to marketing) could influence it. It was considered opportune to mention the price to illustrate that price is not always related to the quality of the product. The chemical composition, antibacterial activity, geographic origin, and “organic” status were compared. All the ajowan essential oils, from eight different suppliers, were native to India. Three of them were listed as organic (European and French labels), and regarding the price, they were valued under the medium market price of this essential oil (51 ± 22 €/L).
