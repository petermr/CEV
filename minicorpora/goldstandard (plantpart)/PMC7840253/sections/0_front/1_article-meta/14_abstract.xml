 <p>The biological synthesis of nanoparticles, due to their environmental and biomedical properties, has been of particular interest to scientists and physicians. Here, iron nanoparticles (FeNPs) were synthesized using 
  <italic>Satureja hortensis</italic> essential oil. Then, the chemical, functional, and morphological properties of these nanoparticles were characterized by typical experiments such as Uv-Vis, FTIR, XRD, FE-SEM, PSA, zeta potential, EDX, and EDX mapping. The results indicated Fe nanoparticles' formation with a cubic morphological structure and a particle size in the range of 9.3-27â€‰nm. The antimicrobial effects of these nanoparticles were further evaluated using disc diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), and minimum fungal concentration (MFC) against two gram-positive bacterial strains (
  <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
  <italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum</italic>), two gram-negative bacterial strains (
  <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and 
  <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>), and one fungus species 
  <italic>Candida albicans</italic>. The results showed that green-synthesized Fe nanoparticles possessed higher antimicrobial properties than Satureja hortensis essential oil against selected pathogenic microorganisms, especially Gram-negative bacteria. Finally, the anticancer effect of these Fe nanoparticles was investigated on human cancer cells, K-562, and MCF-7, by the MTT assay. The results showed the anticancer effect of these nanoparticles against selected cell lines.
