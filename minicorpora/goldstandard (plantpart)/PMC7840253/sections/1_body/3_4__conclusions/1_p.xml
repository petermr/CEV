<p>In this research, a relatively different and straightforward method for the first time was used for the synthesis of green iron magnetic NPs using the essential oil of the Satureja hortensis plant. Subsequently, the synthesized FeNPs were characterized using conventional methods such as Uv-Vis, FT-IR, XRD, FE-SEM, EDX, EDX mapping, PSA, and zeta potential. The evaluation results of synthesized NPs confirmed the existence of FeNPs with a cubic crystal structure and a size of about 9.2-27 nm. Then, the antibacterial effect of the FeNPs was investigated on five microbial strains, including two G
 <sup>+</sup> bacteria, two G
 <sup>−</sup> bacteria, and a fungal species. The results of this experiment demonstrate the antimicrobial activity of these NPs on selected microbes, especially Gram-negative bacteria, 
 <italic>E. Coli</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Finally, the anticancer effect of the synthesized FeNPs was investigated on the human cancer cells, MCF-7, and K-562, and the results showed the potential effect of these NPs on the target cell lines, especially MCF-7. Therefore, it can be concluded that synthesized Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> NPs in a new way can eliminate the disadvantages of physical and chemical methods and be used as a potential nanomedicine drug to treat microbial infections and control cancer diseases.
