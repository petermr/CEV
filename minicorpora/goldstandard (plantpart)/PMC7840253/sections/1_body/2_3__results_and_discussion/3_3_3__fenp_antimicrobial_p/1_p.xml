<p>In this section, the antimicrobial effect of different concentrations (7.8, 15.62, 31.25, 62.5, 125, 250, 500, and 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) of green-synthesized FeNPs and SH essential oil was examined against five microbial strains (
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>) using the disc diffusion method, followed by microdilution methods for obtained MIC, MBC, and MFC. The comparison of the antimicrobial effects of these synthesized NPs with SH essential oil and also with amoxicillin and ketoconazole as positive control samples was indicative of a high potential of the synthesized FeNPs against the selected microbes. The disc diffusion method (
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) showed that the highest diameter of antimicrobial inhibition zone was for Gram-negative bacteria, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> with 16.7 mm and 14.3 mm, respectively. The antimicrobial effect of the SH essential oil in this method was similar to that of synthesized FeNPs, except that the diameter of the inhibition zone was reduced (10.7 and 10.4 mm). As can be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tab5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, in microdilution experiments, antimicrobial effects increased with the increasing concentration of synthesized NPs. High concentrations (500 and 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) of both FeNPs and SH essential oil had antimicrobial effects against five selected microbes. However, the effects of synthesized FeNPs were more significant at high and low concentrations. Similar to the disc diffusion test, MICs and MBC belonged to two Gram-negative bacteria strains, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, with concentrations of 31.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL and 62.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, and 62.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL and 125 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively. As shown from the figure and table, SH essential oil in this method has similar results to the synthesized FeNPs. The MIC and MBC belonged to two gram-negative bacteria, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, with a concentration of 250 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml for each bacterial strain.
