<p>Regarding the antimicrobial effect of synthesized FeNPs against selected gram-positive bacteria strains and fungi species, the results were almost similar in both methods. In the disc diffusion method, the average diameter of the antimicrobial inhibition zone for selected microbes, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>C. glutamicum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, was 12.25 mm. Furthermore, MIC in the microdilution method was at concentrations of 125, 250, and 250 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, respectively. Whereas for SH essential oil, the inhibition zone's average diameter in the disc diffusion method was 10 mm and MIC in the microdilution method for all three microbes at a concentration of 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. Notably, amoxicillin and ketoconazole as a positive control sample showed no antimicrobial properties compared to synthesized compounds. The antimicrobial activity of synthesized FeNPs was more because of smaller particles having a bigger surface area, which can enhance the capability to go through the cell membrane and provide more bactericidal effect. The Fe ions from FeNPs are suggested to become attached to the negatively charged bacterial cell wall and rupture it, which leads to denaturation of protein and finally cell death. Nanoparticles have a large surface-to-volume ratio, so it can firmly adhere to the cell surface of the fungus. Due to its small size, it can directly penetrate the cell and damage the cell wall. Inactivation of fungus by FeNPs involves the direct interaction between nanoparticles and cell surfaces, which affects the permeability of membranes where NPs enter and induce oxidative stress in fungus cells, subsequently resulting in the inhibition of cell growth and eventually cell death. Possibilities of membrane damage caused by direct or electrostatic interaction between FeNPs and cell surfaces, cellular internalization of NPs, and the production of active oxygen species such as H2O2 in cells due to metal oxides have been reported in the literature. A comparison of the present test results with those of previous researches on synthesized FeNPs using another plant extract suggested that the synthesized FeNPs had a high antimicrobial effect and could be used as an antimicrobial drug in medicine [
