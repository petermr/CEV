<p>The EDX spectroscopy analysis of synthesized FeNPs using SH essential oil is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, indicating the collected nanoparticles' elemental composition. These EDX data are beneficial in reflecting the nuclear content on the surface area of the FeNPs. The EDX spectrum showed strong peak signals of Fe with K
 <italic>α</italic>, K
 <italic>β</italic>, and L
 <italic>α</italic> peaks at 6.4, 7.0, and 0.75 keV, respectively. EDX quantification gives atomic percentages of 19.61%, 67.37%, 10.23%, 1.07%, 1.30%, and 0.42% for C, O, Fe, S, Cl, and Mg, respectively (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The presence of Fe and O illustrates that the NPs exist in oxide form, Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> [

 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The presence of C and O ions in the EDX spectrum was related to polyphenols or each compound containing C and O in SH essential oil [

 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The S and Cl peaks signify the presence of sulfate and chlorine groups of the applied FeSO4 and FeCl3 precursors, respectively. The existence of Mg ion in the EDX spectrum is related to the complex of SH plant extract. Probably magnesium plays an important role in enzyme activity. Very similar outcomes of EDX were stated for FeNPs derived from other plant extracts [
