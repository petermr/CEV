<p>The results obtained from biosynthesized FeNPs using the SH extract by the EDX mapping method are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. Accordingly, the significant compositions of SH essential oil are truly distributed all over the FeNPs, as O and Fe are the essential elements of these NPs. Herein, the high quantity of Fe ions within these NPs emphasizes the successful synthesis of magnetite NPs with SH essential oil [
