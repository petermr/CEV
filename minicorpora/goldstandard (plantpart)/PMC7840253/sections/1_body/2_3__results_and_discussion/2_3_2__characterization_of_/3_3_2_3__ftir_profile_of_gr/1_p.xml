<p>FTIR assay was applied to recognize the biomolecules that may be responsible for the reduction of metal ions and stabilization factors for NPs. An FTIR spectrum of SH essential oil formed in a limited 400-4000 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> as shown in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. A band observed at about 3026.74 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> of FTIR in the sample is related to the O-H group from alcohols/phenols [
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], or N-H is stretching of amide A [
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], suggesting that this stretch could be responsible for the reduction of FeSO
 <sub>4</sub>. Another band at 2112.97 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> FTIR spectrums is indicative of C ≡ C, and C ≡ N stretches of aliphatic/aromatic compounds [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Also, the bands from 1621.78 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> to 1767.10 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> demonstrate the C=C group from aromatic compounds [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. A previous report determined these band signs for amid I (C=O stretch) protein [
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The broad peak of about 1402.83 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> was attributed to methyl C-H stretching from carbohydrates [
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The presence of a band at 1103.25 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> to 977.71 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> is related to the C-O stretch in-plane bending of alkanes, alcohols, carboxylic acids, esters, and ethers. Eventually, a band observed about 543.61 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> could represent = CH group in aromatic bicyclic monoterpenes, demonstrating the Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>-NPs [
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>–
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Identified functional groups are found in previous FTIR analysis of Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>-NPs synthesized by Tie Guany in tea extract [
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] and aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>Sageretia thea</italic> [
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The comparison of derived results from this study with those presented on the synthesis of FeNPs indicates the accuracy of the synthesized NPs.
