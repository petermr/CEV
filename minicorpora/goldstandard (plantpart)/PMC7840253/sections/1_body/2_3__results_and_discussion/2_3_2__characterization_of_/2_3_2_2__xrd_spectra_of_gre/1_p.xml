<p>XRD patterns in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> demonstrate that the FeNPs are truly crystalline and display diffraction peaks at 2
 <italic>θ</italic> values of 30.2944, 35.668, 43.2994, 53.8234, 57.2722, 62.9664, and 74.6793, which are corresponding to amorphous structure (220), (311), (400), (422), (511, 440), and (533) planes of cubic crystal system of iron oxide (Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>). The position and relative intensity of diffraction peaks are the same as the standard data for bulk magnetite (JCPDS file No. 96-900-5842), indicating the purity of synthesized FeNPs. Our XRD results support those reported previously [
