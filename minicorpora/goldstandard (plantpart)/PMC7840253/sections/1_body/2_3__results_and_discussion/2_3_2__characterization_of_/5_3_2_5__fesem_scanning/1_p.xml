<p>The formation of Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>-NPs and its morphological dimensions was studied using the FESEM (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The study demonstrated that the average size of the NPs was in a limited area of 27-34â€‰nm. It also exhibits the formation of cube-shaped FeNPs. The formation of cube-shaped NPs was induced by enzymes, chlorine, and magnesium compounds present in the plant sample, which influences the nanoparticles' morphology. Because of a very narrow electron beam, FESEM micrographs have a complete depth of field that is a 3D appearance trait to understand a helpful sample [
