<p>The bioreduction of FeNPs was further explained by measuring their absorbance with a UV-Vis spectrophotometer over the range of 200-900 nm. In this research, synthesized FeNPs had an absorption peak at 273 nm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These results are in harmony with Saranya et al. [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and Pattanayak and Nayak [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], who reported the biosynthesis of FeNPs from 
 <italic>Musa ornat</italic>e and 
 <italic>Azadirachta indica</italic>, respectively, and showed sharp peaks in the range of 250-350 nm in UV–Vis spectra. Absorption peaks between 200 and 300 nm area were observed owing to the excitation of surface Plasmon vibrations in FeNP solution, which is identical to the characteristic UV-Vis spectra of Fe oxide NPs. On the other hand, the formation of FeNPs is known to occur through the complexation of Fe salts followed by capping of Fe with phenolic compounds [
