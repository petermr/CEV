<p>The surface potential of FeNPs was detected using the zeta potential method, which is a fundamental characterization tool to distinguish the stability of NPs in an aqueous solution. As depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8(a)</xref>, the zeta potential of Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>-NPs is -35 mV (at a range of -10 to -45 mV), demonstrating that the synthesized NPs are highly stable due to their strong negative surface charge [
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The distribution size of the synthesized FeNPs was determined by PSA. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8(b)</xref>, an average size of 9.2 nm was obtained for the NPs synthesized in this experiment. The crystalline size of FeNPs calculated from PSA was further counterverified using XRD and FE-SEM methods.
