<p>Also, the exact mechanism of anticancer effects of FeNPs is yet unknown. Nevertheless, different hypotheses have been proposed by researchers in this regard, such as induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest through the mitochondrial pathway in some cancer cell lines [

 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. In some other references, the cytotoxicity of FeNPs is related to their size and shape. They believe that the smaller size of nanoparticles, as well as their cubic and spherical shapes, has potential anticancer effects. The most probable reason for this is that the iron nanoparticles can directly contact the cell surfaces and initiate cytotoxicity [
