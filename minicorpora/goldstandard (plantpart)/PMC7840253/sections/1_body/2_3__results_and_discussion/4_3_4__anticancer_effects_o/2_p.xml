<p>For synthesized FeNPs, on the other hand, low concentrations up to 50 and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for MCF-7 and K-562 cancer cells, respectively, reduced cell viability to 50%, suggesting that synthesized NPs had an anticancer effect in these concentrations. Therefore, it can be stated that the inhibitory concentration (IC50) value for synthesized FeNPs against MCF-7 and K-562 cancer cell lines was 50 and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, respectively. Moreover, at these concentrations, the synthesized NPs have a potential anticancer effect against selected cancer cell lines. However, at concentrations lower than the IC50 value, the antiproliferative effect of the synthesized NPs was significantly reduced. So that, at concentrations of 10 and 1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, synthesized FeNPs had no anticancer properties against both cancer cell lines. Finally, FeNPs synthesized by SH essential oil have potential antioxidant properties for the studied cell lines, especially MCF7, with an IC50 value of 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, and in the future, it can be used as a potential anticancer drug to treat breast cancer cells and chronic myeloid leukemia. The results of this study were compared with previous reports on cancer cells using FeNPs [
