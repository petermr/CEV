<p>The expansion of cancer and its mortality has increased worldwide in recent decades [

 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Moreover, the side effects of therapeutic drugs and the high expense of treatment have drawn the attention of researchers and pharmacists to the production of drugs without side effects using low-cost methods. Meanwhile, the synthesis of metal NPs using plants and herbal extracts as an anticancer drug without side effects and low production cost has attracted researchers and physicians [

 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. In this study, different concentrations (1, 10, 50, 100, 200, and 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) of the synthesized FeNPs and SH essential oil were investigated for their anticancer performance against MCF-7 and K562 human cancer cell lines by the MTT colorimetric method. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, the synthesized FeNPs using SH essential oil had a higher antioxidant property than the SH essential oil. As can be deduced from the figure, both compounds had a carcinogenic effect at high concentrations of 200 and 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL compared to the control group. At low concentrations, however, the results were slightly different. At concentrations below 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL of the SH essential oil, the cell viability percent was reduced for both cell lines. It can be stated that the antioxidant property of the SH essential oil was reduced, or it had no anticancer activity against selected cancer cell lines. The anticancer effect of SH essential oil can be considered, due to the presence of phenolic acids and flavonoid compounds such as thymol, carvacrol, 
 <italic>ρ</italic>-cymene, and 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene. Furthermore, these compounds have anticancer and antimicrobial properties [
