<p>Visual observations of the color change of synthesized FeNPs by SH essential oil from light yellow to burnt chocolate indicate the reduction of FeSO
 <sub>4</sub> and the formation of FeNPs. This color change of FeNPs was due to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) resulting from the formation of FeNPs [
