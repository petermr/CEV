<p>The desire to produce and use of nanometer dimensions is increasing due to the interesting industrial characteristics of these materials and their wide range of applications in various fields of biology, drugs, and medicine [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A vast range of drugs, such as small hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs, vaccines, and biological molecules, can be guided by these nanoparticles (NPs) [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Nanoparticles are widely used to improve treatment and diagnose diseases [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Nanoparticles in nanoliposomes, carbon nanotubes, nanofibers, and nanocarriers have been widely used as drug carriers and cell scaffolding [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Nanoparticles enable the delivery of a significant type of drugs, including anticancer drugs, anti-Alzheimer's drugs, cardiovascular drugs, protease inhibitors, and several macromolecules into the brain cells [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. On the other hand, diseases of microbial and fungal origin are among the most well-known diseases that have always plagued humans, and numerous studies have been conducted to identify, control, and treat these pathogens [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Bacteria strains, such as 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>, and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, as well as 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, are among the pathogens that cause many problems in human's life [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Today, many effective antifungal and antibacterial drugs treat these infectious agents [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, due to the genetic diversity of microbial pathogens, the emergence of resistant strains, and the side effects of these drugs, the replacement of chemical drugs with antimicrobial drugs of living origins such as plants, algae, bacteria, and fungi is incredibly important and has led to research into the use of new drugs without side effects [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The use of metal nanoparticles is one of these new drugs that has attracted particular attention and replaced chemical drugs and also do not have the effects mentioned above [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. There are different ways to produce NPs, such as physical, chemical, and biological methods stated in
