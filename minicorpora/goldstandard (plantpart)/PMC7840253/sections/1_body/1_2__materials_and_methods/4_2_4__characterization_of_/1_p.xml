<p>Ultraviolet-visible (Uv-Vis) spectroscopy is the most important technique and the simplest method to confirm the formation of metal NPs. The absorbance spectrum of the colloidal sample was obtained in the range of 200–900 nm, using a UV–Vis spectrometer (ʎambda35, PERKIN Elmer, England) with distilled water reference. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was performed to classify the biomolecules in SH essential oil, which was responsible for the reduction of the iron metals and the stabilization of NPs. The functional group responsible for the FeNPs was also analyzed by FTIR (Bruker model Tensor II) in the wavelength range 4000–400 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The crystalline nature of green-synthesized FeNPs was confirmed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern. XRD data were recorded by XRD-7000 (Shimadzu, Japan) using monochromatic CuK
 <italic>α</italic> radiation (
 <italic>λ</italic> = 1.54056°A) operated at 40 kV and 30 mA at a 2
 <italic>θ</italic> angle pattern. The scanning was done in the region of 10

 <sup>o</sup>. The images obtained were compared with the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) library to account for the crystalline structure. The morphology and shape of the FeNPs were examined using field emission-scanning electron microscope (FESEM) (Tescan model Mira III) at a voltage of 200 kV. EDX and EDX mapping (Tescan model S Max detector Mira III) analysis were used to confirm the presence of elemental Fe in biosynthesized FeNPs. Additionally, zeta potential, polydispersity, and size distribution measurements of FeNPs were carried out by using the zeta potential (Horiba model SZ-100, Japan) and Particle Size Analyser (PSA) (Malvern model MS1002, England), respectively, after through sonication of synthesized NPs which were diluted by double-distilled water.
