<p>Herein, the aerial part of the Satureja hortensis plant was first selected and thoroughly washed with deionized water to eliminate contaminants and then dried in the shade at the laboratory temperature of 25°C for seven days. Then, plant material was powdered by a grinder apparatus (IKA model A10 BASIC, Germany). The SH essential oil was extracted using a rotary evaporator according to the protocol provided by Mousavi et al. [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. To this end, 10 g of Satureja hortensis powder was poured into a flask, and then 90 V% of ethanol was added to the flask to soak the powdered plant. The suspension containing Satureja hortensis essential oil was filtered after 24 hours. The remaining solution, which contained dissolved components of Satureja hortensis and ethanol, was kept at 1-3°C under suitable conditions for continued operation. Subsequently, an amount of 90 Vol% ethanol was added to the residual condensate and filtered after 24 hours. In order to increase the concentration and purity of the SH essential oil and also to altogether remove ethanol from the extract for antimicrobial testing, both solutions were combined and placed in a rotary evaporator. The production of Satureja hortensis essential oil continued until it reached a minimum concentration and the highest purity. Finally, the extract was stored in suitable conditions (1-3°C) for further testing.
