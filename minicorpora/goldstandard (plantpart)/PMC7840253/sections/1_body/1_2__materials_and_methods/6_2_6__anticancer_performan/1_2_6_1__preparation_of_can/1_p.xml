<p>To perform this experiment, the human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) and chronic myeloid leukemia (K-562) were obtained from the Cancer Cell Bank of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences and transferred to the Research Laboratory of Fars Science and Technology Park Company. Selected cell lines were cultured in RPMI1640 medium (Sigma Co, England) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 g/L of bicarbonate, 2 mL of glutamine, and 100 mg/ml of penicillin-streptomycin. Then, it was incubated at 95% moisture with 5% carbon dioxide at 37°C, so that the number of cells reached 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells.
