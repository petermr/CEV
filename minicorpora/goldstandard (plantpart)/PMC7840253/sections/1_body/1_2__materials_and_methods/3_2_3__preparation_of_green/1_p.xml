<p>Biosynthesis of FeNPs was performed using a simple multistep method according to the protocol stated by Mousavi et al. [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. For this purpose, 3.89 g (14 mmol) of ferrous sulfate (FeSO4·7H2O) and 4.55 g (28 mmol) of ferric chloride (FeCl3·6H2O) were weighed and added to a glass jar containing 200 ml of concentrated Satureja hortensis essential oil. In order to obtain a homogeneous suspension, this solution was then stirred at 80°C for 30 min. Additionally, 30 ml of aqueous ammonia (NH3·H2O) (25%) was pipetted slowly to the obtained suspension and stirred for 1 h at 80°C, similar to the previous step. Next, the produced FeNPs were separated using a strong magnet, and the resulting sediment was washed three times by deionized water to neutralize the resulting magnetic NPs. Eventually, the FeNPs were dried for 1 h at 100°C.
