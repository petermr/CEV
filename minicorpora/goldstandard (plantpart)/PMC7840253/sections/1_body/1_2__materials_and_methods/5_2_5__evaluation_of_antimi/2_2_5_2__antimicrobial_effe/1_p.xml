<p>Herein, the antibacterial and antifungal activities of FeNPs and SH essential oil against the five selected microbial strains were determined using the agar disc diffusion method. For this purpose, the selected pathogenic bacteria were cultured in MHB medium for 24 h, and then 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of this bacterial suspension was spread entirely on the surface of the cultivated plates containing the MHA medium in sterile conditions. Sterile paper discs of 6 mm in diameter were impregnated with 25 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of the tested compounds and placed on the plates' surface containing the cultured bacteria. Subsequently, these plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The stages of the antifungal effects of the selected compounds in this experiment were the same as those of the antibacterial test, but the only difference was in the selected culture medium. Herein, potato dextrose broth (PDB) and potato dextrose agar (PDA) media, specific to fungal growth, were used, respectively, instead of MHB and MHA. In this experiment, amoxicillin and ketoconazole were used as a positive control for antibacterial and antifungal agents, respectively. The test was done three times to ensure its accuracy and precision. The average number obtained was considered as the zones of inhibition after incubation.
