<p>In this study, five references of pathogenic microbial strains were selected, including two G
 <sup>−</sup> bacteria (
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (ATCC 10662) and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ATCC 33876)), two G
 <sup>+</sup> bacteria (
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC 6538) and 
 <italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum</italic> (ATCC 21799)), and one fungal species, 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (ATCC 10231). Microbial samples were purchased from the Iranian Biological Resources Centre (IBRC). In order to evaluate the antimicrobial activity, microbial strains were grown in Muller-Hinton broth (MHB) medium for 24 h at 37°C, and after the incubation period, turbidity was adjusted to approximately 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFUs/mL. Also, serial dilutions (from 7.8 to 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) were prepared from the synthesized FeNPs by dissolving in 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for further experiments. MICs of the biosynthesized FeNPs were determined using broth microdilution methods.
