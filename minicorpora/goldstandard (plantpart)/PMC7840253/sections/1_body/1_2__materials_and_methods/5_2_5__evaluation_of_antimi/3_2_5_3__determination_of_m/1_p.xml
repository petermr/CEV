<p>In this section, the antimicrobial performance of FeNPs and SH essential oil to the five selected microorganisms was evaluated by MIC, MBC, and MFC assays. Similar to the previous step, the selected bacterial strains and the fungus were incubated in the MHB and PDB media, respectively, at 37°C for 24 h until obtaining turbidity of approximately 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFUs/mL (0.5 McFarland). MIC of the synthesized FeNPs was determined using the microdilution assay. Then, 2-fold serial dilutions of green-synthesized FeNPs and SH essential oil were made in sterile MHB medium from a low concentration of 7.8-1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. After that, 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of the FeNPs and SH essential oil dilutions was added to a 96-well microplate, inoculated with 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of the selected microbial strains to a final concentration of 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> CFU/mL, and further incubated (with shaking) at 37°C for 24 h. The MIC of green-synthesized FeNPs was measured as the lowest concentration at which the growth of pathogenic microbial was completely inhibited within 24 h from incubation at 37°C. In this experiment, amoxicillin and ketoconazole were used as a positive control, and normal saline and a sample without FeNPs were used as two negative controls. The optical density was measured by a microplate reader (Hyperion, model MPR4 Plus) at 600 nm. In order to determination of MBC and MFC, 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of each bacterial strains and the fungal species was spread on MHA and PDA plate and further incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The plates with no bacterial and fungal growth were considered as the MBC and MFC, respectively.
