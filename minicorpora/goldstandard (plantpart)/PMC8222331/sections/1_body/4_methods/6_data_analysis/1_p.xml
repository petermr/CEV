<p id="Par30">All the experimental results in brine shrimp lethality test (BSLT) were as mean ± SD of three parallel measurements. The percent of mortality (% M) of the brine shrimp nauplii was calculated for each concentration. The median lethal concentration (LC
 <sub>50</sub>) of the test samples and 95% confidence intervals were determined from the twenty-four hours count using the probit analysis method described by Finney

 </sup>. The LC
 <sub>50</sub>was derived by linear regression method from plotting probit units against correspondent log of concentration. Probit is a unit of measurement of statistical probability based on deviations from the mean of a normal distribution. The obtained LC
 <sub>50</sub> values are compared to Meyer’s and Clarkson’s toxicity criteria
