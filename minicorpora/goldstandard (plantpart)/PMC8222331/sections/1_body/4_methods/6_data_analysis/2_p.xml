<p id="Par31">The screening of cytotoxic effects in vitro of the thyme essential oil against tested cell lines (MOLT-4, MCF-7, H460) were estimated in terms of growth inhibition percentage and expressed as IC
 <sub>50.</sub> 95% confidence intervals were determined. Percent growth inhibition of cells exposed to treatments was calculated as follows:% Inhibition = (100 − PG)/200 × 100
 <italic>.</italic> Percent of growth inhibition was transformed by probit analysis method described by Finney

 </sup>. The IC
 <sub>50</sub>was derived by linear regression method from plotting probit units against correspondent log concentration. The criteria used to categorize the cytotoxicity of thyme essential oil based on U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) and Geran’s protocol was as follows: IC
 <sub>50</sub> ≤ 20 µg/mL = highly cytotoxic, IC
 <sub>50</sub> ranged between 21 and 200 µg/mL = moderately cytotoxic, IC
 <sub>50</sub> ranged between 201 and 500 µg/mL = weakly cytotoxic and IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 501 µg/mL = not cytotoxicity
