<p id="Par25">Artificial sea water (ASW) was prepared by mixing 27 g commercially available salt mixture (Dohse Aquaristik GmbH &amp; CO. KG, Germany) with 900 mL of distilled water, per instructions given. 
 <italic>Artemia salina</italic> eggs (Dohse Aquaristik GmbH &amp; CO. KG, Germany) were added in the small commercial tank for nauplii hatching and incubated in ASW under a halogen lamp, providing direct light and warmth. Twenty-four hours were allowed to hatch the shrimp and to be matured as nauplii. The hatched shrimps are attracted to the light and nauplii free from brine shrimp eggs were collected from the illuminated compartment of the tank. Ten nauplii were counted macroscopically in the stem of the graduated Pasteur pipette against a lighted background and transferred to test tubes. By dissolving the essential oil sample in a convenient solvent (DMSO), a stock solution is made (2000 µg/mL), which was used for serial dilutions to prepare the concentrations 1000; 500; 250; 125; 62.5; 31.25; 15,625; 7.81; 3.9 µg/mL. Each test tube contained essential oil sample dilution in DMSO (2.5 mL) and commercial salt mixture with 10 brine shrimp nauplii (2.5 mL). DMSO and thymol were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. The test was conducted with three replicates for each treatment and ten nauplii per replicate. Each test tube was maintained under illumination during 24 h. Survivors were counted macroscopically, by two independent counters.
