<p id="Par23">The chemical components of the analyzed essential oil were separated by the gas chromatography and identified by the mass spectrometry using Thermo Scientific GC–MS system (DSQ II GC/MS with Trace GC Ultra, Palo Alto, USA). Samples were analyzed on the capillary column ZB-5 MS 30 m × 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.2 μm, (Phenomenex, Torrance, USA). GC–MS settings were as follows: the initial oven temperature was held at 60 °C for 1 min and ramped at 4 °C/min rising to 250 °C; helium was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min; the sample (0.1 μL) was injected manually at the split/splitless injector temperature of 260 °C, with a split ratio 1:50 and transfer line temperature was set to 270 °C for GC–MS analyses. Mass spectra were obtained at 70 eV (EI), the scan range was 45–350 
 <italic>m/z</italic> and Xcalibur version 2.0.7. was used for result processing and quantification. The components of the essential oil were identified by obtained GC–MS spectra and retention indices (RI) relative to C8-C20 n-alkanes. AMDIS computer program version 2.62 was used for GC–MS data processing using NIST library version 2.0. Spectra and obtained retention indices were compared with data already available in the literature
