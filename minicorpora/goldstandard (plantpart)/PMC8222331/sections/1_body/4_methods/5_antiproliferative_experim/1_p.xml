 </sup>. In vitro investigation of antiproliferative activity of the 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. essential oil was conducted in Laboratory for Systemic Biomedicine, Division of Molecular Medicine, “Ruđer Bošković” Institute in Zagreb, Croatia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antiproliferative activity of thyme essential oil by determining the its activity in different concentrations on selected cell lines. For this purpose, three well-characterized cell lines (hematological and solid) were selected according to tumor type, proliferation rate, genotype, growth characteristics and general sensitivity and drug resistance (cell lines used by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) cell line screen). The original substance, as well as stock solution (250 mg/mL/DMSO) were kept in the dark at 4 °C prior to MTT assay. An antitumor drug, doxorubicin, was set up as a positive control (reference compound according to NCI protocol), in parallel with the tested essential oil
