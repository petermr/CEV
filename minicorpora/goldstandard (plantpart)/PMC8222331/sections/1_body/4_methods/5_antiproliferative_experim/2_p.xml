<p id="Par27">Three human tumor cell lines were used in this study: breast adenocarcinoma (MCF7 ATCC HTB-22), lung carcinoma—large cell lung cancer (NCI-H460 ATCC HTB-177) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (MOLT-4 ATCC CRL-1582). Cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). All cell lines were routinely cultured as monolayers (MCF-7 and H460) or suspension (MOLT-4) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 
 <sc>l</sc>-glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (100 U/mL) and streptomycin (100 μg/mL) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO
