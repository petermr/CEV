 </sup>. The cells were inoculated at a density of 1.2 × 104 cells/mL (H460), 3 × 104 cells/mL (MCF-7) or 1 × 105 cells/mL (MOLT-4) onto the 96-well microtiter plates on day 0, depending on the doubling times of the specific cell line. Subsequently, six different concentrations (5, 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 μg/mL) of the analyzed essential oil were added to the wells, and the plates were incubated for further 72 h. As a control, the reference compound doxorubicin was tested in parallel in five ten-fold dilutions (from 10
 <sup>–10</sup> to 10
 <sup>-6</sup> M). Working dilutions were prepared on the day of testing. The dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO) solvent was also tested for possible inhibitory effect by adjusting its concentration to be the same as in working concentration (concentration of DMSO never exceeded 0.1%). After 72 h of incubation, the cell growth rate was assessed by performing an MTT assay. Next, the essential oil treated medium was discarded and MTT was added to each well at a concentration 20 µg/40 µL and incubated for 4 h. After incubation time, the precipitates were dissolved in 160 μL of DMSO. The absorbance (A) was measured at 570 nm using a microplate reader. The experiment was done in quadruplicate.
