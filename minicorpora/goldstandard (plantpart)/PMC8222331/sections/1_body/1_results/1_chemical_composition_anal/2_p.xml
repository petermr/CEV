<p id="Par9">Out of a total of 32 identified components, 25 components presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> represent 97.8% of the total content of the thyme essential oil. This oil was characterized by high percentage of monoterpene hydrocarbons (47.6%) and oxygenated monoterpenes (49.2%), represented in almost equal quantities, and made up ~ 97% of the oil composition. In contrast, aliphatic compounds (1.30%), sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (0.4%) and oxygenated sesquiterpene (0.5%) fractions were lower. As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, p-cymene (30.0%) and γ-terpinene (9.0%) were the major components within the monoterpene hydrocarbon fraction. The most significant components within the oxygeneted monoterpene fraction were thymol (36.7%) and carvacrol (3.6%).
