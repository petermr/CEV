<p id="Par18">Given the limited data on an in vitro antiproliferative activity of thyme essential oil, the obtained IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for the tested tumor cell lines represent a significant contribution to the database on a cytotoxic activity of essential oils. In some cases, this activity was attributed to specific components of the oil. The chemical complexity of the essential oils as a phyto-complex contributes to its biological effects, as each constituent takes part in the overall outcome and may modulate the effects of the others. Studies on individual ingredients might report results that do not recapitulate the effect of treatment with the phyto-complex as a whole.
