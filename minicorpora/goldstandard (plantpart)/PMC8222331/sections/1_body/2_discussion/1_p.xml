 </sup>, which corresponds to the total yield of essential oil obtained in our study (1.5%) (v/w). According to the literature, different chemotypes of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. have been reported, providing evidence of intraspecific chemical variability of this plant species. There are at least 6 chemotypes of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
 </sup>, with different compositions of the essential oil. The main components are thymol, carvacrol, p-cymene, γ-terpinene, linalool, β- myrcene and terpinen-4-ol
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
 </sup>. The above results show that chemical composition of the 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. essential oil, native to Bosnia and Herzegovina, was dominated by thymol (36.7%), p-cymene (30.0%), γ-terpinene (9.0%), carvacrol (3.6%). These results are in agreement with previous published data on thyme essential oil from different geographical regions in Europe
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>
 </sup>, reporting that monoterpene alcohol and monoterpene hydrocarbon fractions were the most abundant constituents in the oil of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. The sum of phenolic compounds (thymol and carvacrol) in the studied oils varied from 19.4 to 84.4%, and the sum of their precursors (p-cymene and γ-terpinene) ranged from 5.7 to 38.5%

 </sup>. The effect of different geographical zone on percentage composition was also confirmed by the research of Satyal et al. who worked on thyme collected from different regions
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>
 </sup>. The result of their study showed that the 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. collected from France showed higher percentage of linalool (76.2%) and linalyl acetate (14.3%) where the thyme obtained from Serbia showed the higher presence of geraniol (59.8%) and geranyl acetate (16.7%). The chemical composition analysis obtained suggests that 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. essential oil isolated in this study can be classified as ‘thymol’ chemotype, with thymol as the predominant compound, which complies with the definition in the European Pharmacopoeia
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>
 </sup>. Sum of the contents of thymol and carvacrol also meets the requirements of European Pharmacopoeia (minimum 40.0%)
