<p id="Par20">Dose dependent toxicity was observed in brine shrimp lethality assay as well as the in vitro assay conducted in cancer cell lines supporting the presence of bioactive compounds in 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. essential oil. The results of our study show that the essential oil of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. has antiproliferative activity against several malignant cell lines (MOLT-4, MCF-7 and H460). This study has, for the first time, demonstrated cytotoxic activity of thyme essential oil to a lung carcinoma and an acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line. We suggest that the antiproliferative activity of phytochemicals present in 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> L. essential oil is cancer cell line dependent. Moreover, we assumed that results obtained in this study point to the activity of the more abundant compounds thymol and p-cymene in analyzed thyme oil. The previously stated positive correlation between BSLT and in vitro testing on cancer cell lines are in accordance with results obtained in this study. This confirms, that BSLT is an adequate method for preliminary toxicity testing in tumor cell lines.
