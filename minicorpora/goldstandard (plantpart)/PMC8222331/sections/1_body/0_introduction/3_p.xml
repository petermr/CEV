<p id="Par4">Certain essential oils (EOs) have been labeled as promising anticancer agents and are currently being investigated for their cytotoxic and antiproliferative activities in cancer cell lines or experimental animals
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
 </sup>. Different mechanisms have been reported for cytotoxic effects of EOs or their constituents. These include induction of cell death by apoptosis and/or necrosis, antimutagenic, antiproliferative, antioxidant properties, cell cycle arrest, and loss of key organelle functions

 </sup>. According to the research findings, essential oils possess anticancer potential against mouth, breast, lung, prostate, liver, colon, and brain cancer and even in leukemia

 </sup>. Studies indicate that the specific components of essential oils increase the cytotoxic activity of chemotherapeutic drugs (docetaxel, paclitaxel, 5-fluorouracil) on different cell lines and thus open the possibility of reducing their dose while providing the same effect
