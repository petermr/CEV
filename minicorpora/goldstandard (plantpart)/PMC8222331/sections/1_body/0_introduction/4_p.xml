<p id="Par5">Oxygenated monoterpenes and monoterpene hydrocarbons represent the main chemical components of 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> L. essential oil. The natural terpenoid thymol and its phenol isomer carvacrol are the most abundant compounds of this oil. Non-clinical data reported that thyme essential oil exhibits strong antibacterial, antifungal, spasmolytic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory activities
