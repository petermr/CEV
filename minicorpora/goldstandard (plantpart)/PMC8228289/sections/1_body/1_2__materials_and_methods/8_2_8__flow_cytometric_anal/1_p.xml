<p>Detection of apoptotic cells was performed using the Annexin V-PI double staining method [
 <xref rid="B41-antioxidants-10-00875" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. A commercially available kit was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a seeding density of 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well. After an overnight incubation, cells were treated with 89 or 184 μg/mL of LCO for 24, 48, or 72 h. Cells treated with appropriate DMSO (vehicle) concentrations were used as control. Following collection, cells were stained and analyzed on an Attune NxT flow cytometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Data obtained were analyzed using FlowJo V10 software (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR, USA).
