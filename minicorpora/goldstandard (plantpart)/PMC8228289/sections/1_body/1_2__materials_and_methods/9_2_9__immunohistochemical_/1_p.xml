<p>Excised tumors were fixed in 10% formalin before being dehydrated in graded concentrations of ethanol, xylole, and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin tissue blocks were cut into 3 μm thick sections with a microtome. Next, the sections were mounted onto charged glass slides. An hematoxylin and eosin stained section was obtained from each tissue block. Immunostaining was performed based on streptavidin-biotin peroxidase labeled method. Deparaffinization and hydratation were done by immersing the tissue sections into graded concentrations of ethanol to deionized water. Primary antibodies, against survivin (#2808 Cell Signaling, dilution 1:50) or cleaved caspase 3 (#9661 Cell Signaling, dilution 1:1000), were then applied to the tissues and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Immunoreactivity was visualized with 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin. For negative controls, the primary antibody was omitted. An image analysis system composed of the Olympus BX43 upright microscope, digital camera Olympus Cam-SC30 (Olympus Europa, Hamburg, Germany) and soft analysis (analySISH) was used. Two observers selected at least 10 representative regions from all the sections of each case, where immunopositive tumor cells were counted by using the ×40 objective lens, adopting a continuous score system. The expression was defined as the percentage of positive cells in the total number of the counted cells (number of immunopositive cells/total number of the counted cells).</p>
