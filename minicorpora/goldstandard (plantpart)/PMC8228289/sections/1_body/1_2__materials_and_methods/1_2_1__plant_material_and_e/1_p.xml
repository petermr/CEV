<p>Collection and identification of plant material was described in a previous study by our team regarding the biological properties of 
 <italic>Lippia citriodora</italic> oil [
 <xref rid="B27-antioxidants-10-00875" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Briefly, plant samples of small shrubs were purchased by Vioryl S.A. from an herbal market (Afidnes, Athens, Greece), identified as 
 <italic>Lippia citriodora</italic> by a botanist, and planted and maintained in pots until their first inflorescence in May/June when the leaves and stems were collected. The collected parts of the herb were subjected to hydrodistillation in a laboratory-scale, water-steam distillation apparatus as described in our team’s previously published study [
 <xref rid="B27-antioxidants-10-00875" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The composition of the extracted oil was analyzed by Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) (GC: 6890 A, Agilent Technologies, USA; MSD: 5973, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) using an HP-1 ms column (25 m, 0.2 mm i.d., 0.33 μm film thickness). The detailed analysis process and chemical composition of the oil are described in Fitsiou et al. [
