<p>DA3 cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a seeding density of 3 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well. After 24 h, when a confluent monolayer was formed, a 10 μL pipette tip was used to scratch the monolayer across the well. Next, monolayers were washed with PBS so that the detached cells could be removed and either DMSO (DMSO concentration ≤ 0.1% 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) for control cells or LCO-containing medium for treated cells was added to the wells. To exclude the growth inhibitory effect of LCO as a potential mechanism of wound-healing inhibition, non-toxic concentrations were used (as determined by the SRB assay) for the treatment of the cells. Specifically, cells were treated with 46 μg/mL of LCO. Cells were photographed with a light microscope (Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany) that was equipped with a digital camera. Multiple photographs per time point were analyzed with ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) from three independent experiments and the average % wound area (% open image area) was calculated.
