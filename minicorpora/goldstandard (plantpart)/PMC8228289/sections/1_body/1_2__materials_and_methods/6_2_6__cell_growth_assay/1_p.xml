<p>Cell growth rate was analyzed by the Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay [
 <xref rid="B40-antioxidants-10-00875" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], as previously described [
 <xref rid="B11-antioxidants-10-00875" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Briefly, 8000 DA3 cells were seeded per well in a 96-well plate. Cells were exposed to a wide range of increasing LCO concentrations (0–0.92 mg/mL) dissolved in DMSO (1:1 
 <italic>v/v</italic>), for 24, 48, or 72 h. Control cells were incubated in DMSO-containing DMEM (DMSO concentration ≤ 0.1% 
 <italic>v/v</italic>). After treatment, cells were fixed with TCA for 1 h and stained with SRB dissolved in acetic acid for 30 min. Tris base was added in SRB-stained cells in order to dissolve the SRB cell-bound stain before measuring the samples’ absorbance (optical density, OD) at 492 nm. For the OD measurement, a microplate reader (Enspire, Perkin Elmer) was employed. Results presented are representative of at least three independent experiments. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated using the Sigma Plot software v.11. The % inhibition of cell growth was calculated by the following formula:
 <disp-formula>% 
  <italic>growth</italic> = (
  <italic>mean OD sample</italic>)/(
  <italic>mean OD control</italic> × 100)
  <label>(2)</label>
 </disp-formula>
