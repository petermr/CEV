<p>Mice were separated into two independent groups (nine mice per group) and a previously described treatment protocol was followed [

 <xref rid="B39-antioxidants-10-00875" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Briefly, LCO was administered 
 <italic>per os</italic> by oral gavage at a daily dose of 0.552 g/kg of animal body weight diluted in a final volume of 150 μL of corn oil (vehicle), for 14 days. Animals in the control group received an equal volume of plain corn oil. Mice were monitored daily for weight fluctuations and signs of discomfort or disease. DA3 cells (5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>) were injected subcutaneously, in the scruff of mice’s necks on the 12th day of LCO administration. Animals were euthanized by cervical dislocation on the 7th day post cancer cells inoculation. Developed tumors, spleens, and livers were surgically removed from all animals. The organs were weighed and tumor dimensions were defined by an electronic micrometer. Tumor volume was calculated by the modified ellipsoid formula (mm
 <sup>3</sup>):
 <disp-formula>
  <italic>Tumor volume</italic> = 0.5 × (

  <sup>2</sup> ×
