<p>In accordance with our in vitro results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00875-f002">Figure 2</xref>), the apoptotic marker cleaved caspase 3 (c-cas3) was elevated in the tumor tissue of LCO-treated animals. In specific, an average of 30% of cells was positive for active caspase 3 in mice that had been receiving LCO compared to 19% in control animals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00875-f005">Figure 5</xref>d). These results, along with the elevated pro-apoptotic-to-live cellsâ€™ ratios that were detected in vitro in DA3 cells exposed to LCO, indicate that apoptosis might be among the mechanisms initiated by LCO in breast cancer cells. Moreover, protein expression of survivin, a proliferation marker and negative regulator of apoptosis that is highly expressed in most human tumors [
