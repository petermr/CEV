<p>Volatile profile analysis by GC-MS conducted by our team identified the composition of LCO, which was described in detail in a previous published study [
 <xref rid="B27-antioxidants-10-00875" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Briefly, 43 compounds representing the 87% of the total chromatographic area were identified. The two major compounds were determined to be geranial (
 <italic>trans</italic>-citral) and neral (
 <italic>cis</italic>-citral), reported as citral, which is the sum of the two isomers (
 <xref rid="antioxidants-10-00875-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Neral and geranial accounted for 17.2% or 26.4%, respectively, of the total chromatographic area, which is in accordance with the literature where citral was previously reported as one of the main components of the oil extracted from plants of the citriodora species [
 <xref rid="B18-antioxidants-10-00875" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Noteworthy, the 
 <italic>trans</italic>-isomer geranial which is 1.5 times more abundant in LCO than neral, was reported to exert more potent antitumor properties as compared to the 
 <italic>cis</italic>-isomer, neral [
 <xref rid="B42-antioxidants-10-00875" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Interestingly, 
 <italic>L. citriodora</italic> oil with a similar composition was previously shown to possess antioxidant properties [
 <xref rid="B22-antioxidants-10-00875" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], while our team investigated the antioxidant potential of LCO and reported its ability to protect Jurkat cells against H
