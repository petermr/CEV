<p>LCO exhibited a dose- and time-dependent growth inhibitory activity against DA3 murine mammary adenocarcinoma cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00875-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for 24, 48, or 72 h were determined to be 96.4 ± 8.9, 77.8 ± 1.5, or 70.7 ± 5.5 μg/mL, respectively (
 <xref rid="antioxidants-10-00875-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The higher IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for 24 h compared to 48 and 72 h and for 48 h compared to 72 h implied that the growth inhibitory effect exerted by LCO against DA3 cells was time dependent. Cytotoxicity of LCO was previously reported by our team against human melanoma A375, hepatic HepG2, breast MCF-7, and colonic Caco2 cancer cell lines. We also observed a moderate cytotoxic activity of LCO against THP-1 human leukemic cells’ line (EC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 100 μg/mL) [

 <xref rid="B28-antioxidants-10-00875" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. LCO was also shown to inhibit the growth of murine P815 mastocytoma [
 <xref rid="B29-antioxidants-10-00875" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], human breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells, as well as chronic myelogenous erythroleukemia K562 and neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells [
 <xref rid="B30-antioxidants-10-00875" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Besides the essential oil extracted from the plant, various other 
 <italic>L. citriodora</italic> extracts were reported to exert antiproliferative activity against cancer cell lines as well [

 <xref rid="B44-antioxidants-10-00875" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Noteworthy, 
 <italic>L. citriodora</italic> extracts appear to exert cancer-specific, growth-inhibitory effects. Escobar et al. described that LCO did not significantly affect the proliferation rate of normal Vero monkey kidney cells [
 <xref rid="B28-antioxidants-10-00875" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The potential selective antiproliferative activity of 
 <italic>L. citriodora</italic> extracts against cancer cells was also indicated by the cytotoxic effect of the herbal substance acteoside, isolated from 
 <italic>L. citriodora</italic> leaves, against A5 murine metastatic spindle carcinoma cells. Interestingly, acteoside did not affect to the same extent the viability of C5N normal mouse keratinocytes [
 <xref rid="B45-antioxidants-10-00875" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Moreover, LCO exhibited moderate antiproliferative activity against human normal ESCs (endometrial stromal cells) [
 <xref rid="B30-antioxidants-10-00875" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Thus, even though there are only a few studies investigating the in vitro antiproliferative potential of LCO, these studies suggest that the oil extracted from 
 <italic>L. citriodora</italic> exerts potent, diverse, and selective antitumor activities.
