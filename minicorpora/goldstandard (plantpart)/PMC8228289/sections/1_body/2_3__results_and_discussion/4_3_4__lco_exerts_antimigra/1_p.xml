<p>Furthermore, we investigated whether LCO affects migration of DA3 cells in vitro. Migration of cancer cells is a crucial step in cancer invasion and metastasis [

Identification of novel therapeutic compounds that have the potential to attenuate cancer cell migration could lead to the development of novel or combination anticancer strategies. Noteworthy, various phytochemicals have been reported to block migration of cancer cells in vitro [

 <xref rid="B52-antioxidants-10-00875" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Despite the lack of studies regarding the potential antimigratory effect of LCO, citral, the most abundant phytochemical in LCO, was shown to inhibit the migration of both human and murine breast cancer cells [

 <xref rid="B53-antioxidants-10-00875" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Thus, we employed the wound-healing assay in order to investigate whether LCO attenuates migration of DA3 cells. Noteworthy, the cells were treated with a non-toxic concentration of LCO (46 μg/mL) that, according to our SRB results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00875-f001">Figure 1</xref>), did not significantly affect cell growth. Our results indicate that it took more time for the LCO-treated cells to fill the open area compared to control cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00875-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Specifically, the mean ratio of open area closure in control cells reached 94% after only 2 h, while the LCO-treated group exhibited only a 58% of open-area-closure ratio in the same time point. Wound closure occurred after 3 h in control cells while the closure was not complete in LCO-treated cells that exhibited a remaining 15% of open image area. Considering the reported antimigratory activity of citral, LCO’s observed migration-attenuating effect might be attributed to its major constituent.
