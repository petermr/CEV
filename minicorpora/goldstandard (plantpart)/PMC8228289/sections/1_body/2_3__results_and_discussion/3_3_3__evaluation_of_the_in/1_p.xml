<p>The interesting observation of the time-dependent, growth inhibitory effect of LCO led us to further investigate the potential mechanism involved. Interestingly, it has been reported in the literature that both the oil as a mixture [

 <italic>L. citriodora</italic> [
 <xref rid="B45-antioxidants-10-00875" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], may induce apoptosis in cancer cells. Moreover, citral, which has been identified as the major component of LCO [
 <xref rid="B27-antioxidants-10-00875" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], was reported to induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo in murine tumor models [

 <xref rid="B46-antioxidants-10-00875" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Thus, we investigated the potential pro-apoptotic activity of LCO against DA3 cells by the flow cytometric analysis of Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) double staining method for the identification of early apoptotic cells. Our results are in accordance with the literature and indicate that LCO induces morphological changes in cells that are typical during apoptosis in DA3 cells. Specifically, cells treated with 0.089 or 0.184 mg/mL of LCO for 24 h exhibited, compared to control, a 12% or 55% rise, respectively, in the ratio of early apoptotic to viable cells (

Cells treated for 48 h exhibited an increase of 30% or 517%, while cells treated for 72 h exhibited an increase of 10% or a decrease of 1% (as progressively, an increasing number of cells undergoes cell death) in the ratio of early apoptotic to viable cells for 0.089 or 0.184 mg/mL of LCO, respectively.
