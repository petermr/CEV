<p>Oral administration of LCO for 14 days (

Moreover, while animal health was daily monitored for signs of disease or discomfort, no signs of pain or behavioral deviations from normal were detected. Unfortunately, there are no previous studies regarding the in vivo toxicity of the essential oil extracted from 
 <italic>L. citriodora</italic>. Etemad et al. studied the in vivo toxicological profile of the intraperitoneally administered aqueous extract from the plant and reported that the LD
 <sub>50</sub> in BALB/c mice is 5 g/kg of body weight [
