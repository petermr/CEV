<p>Noteworthy, the administration scheme of LCO, described in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00875-f004">Figure 4</xref>a, induced a 55% inhibition in tumor volume in the DA3 breast adenocarcinoma model. In specific, 7 days post cancer cellsâ€™ inoculation, control animals developed tumors of an average size of 377 mm
 <sup>3</sup>, while LCO-treated animals developed tumors of an average size of 170 mm
 <sup>3</sup>. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the antitumor potential of orally administered LCO.
