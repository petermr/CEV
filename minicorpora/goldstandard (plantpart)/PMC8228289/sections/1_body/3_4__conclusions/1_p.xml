<p>Our results provide compelling evidence for the antitumor potential of LCO against breast cancer. We demonstrated that LCO, as a mixture of various phytochemicals with antioxidant activity, inhibits the proliferation of breast cancer cells in vitro and attenuates tumor growth in vivo in a murine breast adenocarcinoma model. In line with the traditional use of the plant in tea infusion preparations, we decided to use oral exposure as the route of LCO administration. Despite the restricted bioavailability due to pre-systemic metabolism, LCO, as a mixture of phytochemicals, induced a 55% inhibition in tumor volume. Noteworthy, LCO attenuated the migration and proliferation of DA3 breast cancer cells in vitro, partially by inducing apoptotic cell death as evidenced by the Annexin V/PI assay. Moreover, orally administered LCO induced the activation of caspase 3 and downregulated the protein expression of the anti-apoptotic protein survivin in mouse tumor tissue. Taken together, these results confirm the hypothesis that the essential oil extracted from the plant 
 <italic>L. citriodora</italic> exerts antitumor effects against breast adenocarcinoma and highlight the interest of LCO as a source of bioactive compounds with great nutraceutical potential. LCOâ€™s most abundant phytochemical, citral, is a good candidate for further investigation in future studies.
