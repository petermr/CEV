 <italic>Lippia citriodora</italic> is a flowering subshrub/shrub, native in South America, that was introduced in Europe at the end of 17th century [

 <italic>Lippia triphylla</italic>, 
 <italic>Verbena triphylla</italic>, 
 <italic>Aloysia triphylla</italic>, 
 <italic>Aloysia citriodora</italic>, 
 <italic>Verbena citriodora,</italic> or 
 <italic>Lemon verbena</italic>. 
 <italic>L. citriodora</italic> is mostly cultivated for its lemon-scented leaves, traditionally used in folk medicine for the alleviation of gastrointestinal symptoms, fever, cold, asthma, diabetes, spasms, insomnia, and anxiety [

 <xref rid="B20-antioxidants-10-00875" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Plant extracts were shown to exert significant antioxidant activity that was associated with their flavonoid and phenolic content [

 <xref rid="B24-antioxidants-10-00875" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Antioxidant properties of 
 <italic>L. citriodora</italic> were evaluated in various in vitro, ex vivo, or in vivo systems, employing different biochemical assays. 
 <italic>L. citriodora</italic> infusion was shown to act as a free radical scavenger against superoxide, hydroxyl radicals, and hypochlorous acid [
 <xref rid="B23-antioxidants-10-00875" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Aqueous extracts of the plant were shown to inhibit the ABTS (2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid)) and DPPH (2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radicals and protect against protein carbonylation and lipid peroxidation in Wistar rat brain homogenates [
 <xref rid="B25-antioxidants-10-00875" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], while alcoholic and aqueous extracts, upon oral administration, were shown to elevate the blood glutathione levels in the alloxan-induced diabetic rat model [
 <xref rid="B26-antioxidants-10-00875" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Noteworthy, both the essential oil investigated in this study as well as citral, a mixture of two terpenoid isomers that was identified as the oil’s main constituent, were shown to inhibit the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative damage in human Jurkat T-leukemia cells [
 <xref rid="B27-antioxidants-10-00875" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Besides the plant’s well-documented antioxidant potential, recent studies demonstrate that various extracts from 
 <italic>L. citriodora</italic> have the potential to inhibit the growth of cancer cells in vitro [

 <italic>L. citriodora</italic> [
 <xref rid="B27-antioxidants-10-00875" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], exerts antitumor activity in murine breast cancer models upon oral administration [
