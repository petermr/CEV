 <xref rid="B7-antioxidants-10-00875" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], antifungal [

 <xref rid="B10-antioxidants-10-00875" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] activities. Most importantly, several plant extracts exert significant antitumor effects, namely, antiproliferative, redox regulating, cell cycle arrest-inducing, anti-migratory, and pro-apoptotic [

Carcinogenesis and tumor growth are complex processes that involve various mechanisms and the recruitment of a diverse range of molecules. Phytochemicals, being functionally pleiotropic, may lead to simultaneous targeting of the various events/pathways involved in cancer development and progression [
 <xref rid="B15-antioxidants-10-00875" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Certain dietary phytochemicals, besides their direct antitumor effects, were shown to enhance the therapeutic potency of chemotherapeutic agents [
 <xref rid="B16-antioxidants-10-00875" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Crucially, the anticancer properties of various phytochemicals were linked to their antioxidant activity [
