<p>Therefore, the aim of this work was to examine the potential antitumor effects against breast cancer of the essential oil extracted from the leaves of 
 <italic>L. citriodora</italic> (LCO) as a plant-specific mixture of various bioactive compounds. Specifically, we assayed the potential growth inhibitory, anti-migratory, and pro-apoptotic activities of the essential oil in vitro. Moreover, we examined whether oral administration of the oil attenuates growth of breast cancer in vivo in the experimental DA3 mouse tumor model.
