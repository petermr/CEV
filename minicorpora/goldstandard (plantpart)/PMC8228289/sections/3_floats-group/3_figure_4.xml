  <p>Orally administered LCO in mice is well tolerated. (
   <bold>a</bold>) LCO was administered daily to BALB/c mice by oral gavage for 14 days (0.552 g/kg body weight/day). On the 12th day, mice were inoculated subcutaneously with DA3 cancer cells (5 Ã— 10
   <sup>6</sup> cells per mouse) and, 7 days later, animals were euthanized. (
   <bold>b</bold>) No significant change was observed in animal body weight between LCO-treated and control mice during the LCO administration period. No significant differences were observed between (
   <bold>c</bold>) liver- or (
   <bold>d</bold>) spleen-weight-to-body-weight ratios between control and LCO-treated mice.
