  <p>LCO induces apoptotic cell death in DA3 murine breast adenocarcinoma cells detected by flow cytometry. Cells were treated with 0.089 or 0.184 mg/mL of the LCO for 24, 48, or 72 h and stained with Annexin V-FITC and PI before being analyzed by flow cytometry. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Density plots of control and treated cells. The percentages of viable (Annexin V-FITC and PI negative), early apoptotic (Annexin V-positive and PI-negative), and late apoptotic/necrotic (Annexin V/PI double-positive) cells are indicated on the plots. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Percentage (%) ratio of early apoptotic to viable cells. At least 10,000 cells were analyzed per sample. Results are presented as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. Asterisks indicate statistically significant difference between control and treated cells (*
