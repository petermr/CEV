  <p>Oral administration of LCO attenuates tumor growth in DA3 breast cancer model in mice. LCO was administered daily to BALB/c mice by oral gavage for 14 days and, on the 12th day, mice were inoculated subcutaneously with DA3 cancer cells (5 × 10
   <sup>6</sup> cells per mouse). Seven days later, animals were euthanized and the developed tumors were harvested. A statistically significant reduction of ≈55% in tumor volume (
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.001, Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test) was observed in LCO-treated animals compared to the control group. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Graphical representation of tumor volume distribution (solid lines indicate median and dashed lines indicate mean values), (
   <bold>b</bold>) mean tumor volume, and (
   <bold>c</bold>) photographic observation of excised tumors. (
   <bold>d</bold>–
   <bold>f</bold>) Immunohistochemical detection of (
   <bold>d</bold>) cleaved caspase-3 and (
   <bold>e</bold>) survivin in tumor tissue from LCO-treated or control mice. (
   <bold>f</bold>) Representative images showing the effect of LCO administration on survivin andc-cas3 protein levels. The differences in the expression of cleaved cas-3 or survivin in tumor tissue from treated versus control mice are statistically significant (
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.023 or 
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.024, respectively), as calculated using the SigmaPlot 11.0 statistical software; (* 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, ** 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005).
