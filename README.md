CEVOpen Plant Oils
==================

This is an [OpenNotebook](OPENNOTEBOOK_Science.md) project to analyze the composition and activity of oils derived from plants as reported in
Open Access literature. 

Open Literature
---------------
Using [EuropePMC](http://europepmc.org) and ContentMine's getpapers/ami up to 10,000 articles on essential oils are available.
These  report some/all of:

* plant identity
* literature survey of previously reported activities 
* oil chemical composition (by chemical name)
* experimentals determination of activity (often against organisms)

Dictionaries
------------
The literature is analyzed to suggests terms for inclusion in dictionaries. All terms are linked to Wikidata where possible

* [plant](dictionary/plant) (species binomial or genus) from EssoilDB (cleaned)
* [plant part](dictionary/plantpart) not yet transferred
* [extraction methodology] and metadata not yet transferred 
* [chemical compound](dictionary/compound) from EssoildDB (cleaned)
* [activity](dictionary/activity) (medicinal, other biological (e.g. insect repellent, pheromone))
* [targetOrganism](dictionary/targetOrganism) (e.g. bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, vectors)

BJOC paper
----------

We are [writing a paper](BJOC/) as we go. Hopefully in time for a special issue.

Docker
------

We are building a [Docker distribution](docker/) of the software.
